Welles is shoehorned into his\n     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.\n\n     An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his\n     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,\n     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his\n     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. \n\n                             OLDER WOMAN \n                 Thank you. \n\n     Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.

I'll tell you\n                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to\n                 live down there. \n\n                             AMY \n                 You better not be smoking, that's\n                 all I can say. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Honey, I'm not, please... \n\n     Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. \n\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,\n     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a\n     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing\n     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.\n\n     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on\n     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. \n\n                             AMY\n                 I love you.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I love you. \n\n     He looks towards her in the dark.  He gets up, gets a towel\n     from the bathroom and wraps it around him. \n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT \n\n     Cindy's crying.  Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 What's all the trouble, Cinderella?\n                 What are you crying about, huh? \n\n     He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her. \n\n\n     EXT.

It's\n                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... \n\n                             POLITICIAN \n                 None too discreet, is he? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 No, sir, he is not. \n\n                             POLITICIAN \n                 He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn\n                 my daughter, but what can you do? \n\n     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 The um... you'll find my invoice in\n                 the envelope.

Welles'\n     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban\n     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.\n\n     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One\n     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor\n     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. \n\n\n     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT\n\n     MUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is\n     with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS.  Welles hoists his ball,\n     preparing to bowl.  He takes three steps, releases...\n\n     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.\n\n     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his\n     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,\n     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. \n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \n\n     Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy\n     in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.

He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE\n     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. \n\n                             WELLES \n                       (into PHONE) \n                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a\n                 minute...?\n\n     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads\n     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... \n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the\n     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of\n     BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles\n     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. \n\n                             WELLES \n                       (shouts upstairs)\n                 Okay, I've got it.\n                       (into phone)\n                 Hello... sorry, I was switching\n                 phones.

Welles' car heads\n     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. \n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT \n\n     Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. \n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT \n\n     The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.\n     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far\n     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits\n     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Mister Welles. You're very prompt.   \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I try to be.\n\n     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I appreciate your coming on such\n                 short notice. \n\n     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN\n                 This is Mister Longdale, my late\n                 husband's attorney. \n\n     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Uh huh, pleasure. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has\n                 something he feels he simply must\n                 say before you and I speak.\n\n                             LONGDALE \n                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I\n                 insisted on being here as soon as I\n                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm listening. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one\n                 of the executors of his estate, it\n                 concerns me that a meeting of this\n                 sort should take place without my\n                 being asked to attend. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Of what sort? \n\n                             LONGDALE\n                 You are a private investigator? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 That's right. \n\n                             LONGDALE \n                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.\n                 Christian has for engaging the\n                 services of a private investigator,\n                 I should certainly be a party to.\n                 But, since she feels differently, I\n                 can only go on the record as having\n                 expressed my adamant disapproval. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone\n                 on the record, and now perhaps you\n                 should just be gone. \n\n     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Have a pleasant evening. \n                       (to Welles) \n                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Thank you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a\n     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 He's odd.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 He's a lawyer.\n                       (offers tea)\n                 Please, sit, here...\n\n     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I've spoken to friends of mine and\n                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in\n                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about\n                 you.  I must say you have friends in\n                 influential places. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 I've been privileged to provide\n                 services for people I admire.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 You are highly recommended.  Praised\n                 for your discretion... your strict\n                 adherence to confidentiality. \n\n     Welles nods, sipping tea. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 As you know, my husband passed away\n                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 My condolences. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 His passing has left me with...\n                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,\n                 terrible dilemma. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'll do whatever I can to help. \n\n     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.\n\n     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived\n     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls\n     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,\n     baked enamel sign nailed up, \"CHRISTIAN STEEL.\" \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 His inner sanctum. \n\n     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.\n     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,\n     industrial landscape behind him. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Not many people have been inside\n                 this room. \n\n     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various\n     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,\n     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. \n\n\n                             WELLES \n                 Pittsburgh? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Mostly.  That's where he started his\n                 empire building.\n                       (looks up at portrait)\n                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an\n                 eccentric, but that was something he\n                 cultivated.  He wanted to be\n                 legendary.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 He succeeded. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 We were married forty-five years.\n                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had\n                 our troubles.  There were plenty of\n                 places for him to be other than\n                 here, but he was always loyal to me,\n                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.\n\n     Welles waits. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I wear a gun when I can tell a\n                 client expects me to.  Other than\n                 that, there's never any reason. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Just curious. \n\n     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a\n     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 My husband was the only one with the\n                 combination to this safe.  I knew\n                 about it, but as far as I was\n                 concerned it was none of my\n                 business.  Not till now, that is. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll\n                 bet the lawyer loved that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 There was nothing he could do.  My\n                 husband left everything to me.\n                       (looks at safe)\n                 I prevented anyone from seeing the\n                 contents.  I felt these were my\n                 husband's private things.  I\n                 didn't... I didn't realize... \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Do you want to tell me what you\n                 found? \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...\n\n     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a\n     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 It's a film... of a girl being\n                 murdered. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm afraid I don't... \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 This is a movie showing a girl being\n                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,\n                 and a man rapes her... and he begins\n                 to cut her with a knife...\n                       (pause)\n                 I only watched what I could.\n\n     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I didn't know what to think.  I\n                 can't tell you how horrible it's\n                 been, to know this belonged to my\n                 husband.  To know that he watched\n                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't\n                 go to the police...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you\n                 sit down a moment? \n                       (leads her to a chair) \n                 I want you to listen carefully.\n                 What you're talking about is a\n                 \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I\n                 know, snuff films are a kind of...\n                 urban myth.  Like, red light\n                 district folklore.  There's no such\n                 thing, I can assure you. \n\n     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Please, believe me.  This is\n                 probably a stag film.  Simulated\n                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might\n                 seem real, but there are ways of\n                 making it look realistic... fake\n                 blood and special effects...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 No. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 If you were to study it you'd see\n                 the camera cutting away... you'd see\n                 the tricks they can play...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I'm telling you it's not that. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I'm sure it is. \n                       (smiles) \n                 It's probably something your husband\n                 was given as a bad joke.  More than\n                 likely he never even watched it. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Will you watch it and see for\n                 yourself? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's\n                 nothing to worry about. \n\n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \n\n     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.\n     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the\n     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.\n     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...\n\n     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy\n     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny\n     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a\n     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel\n     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful\n     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,\n     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts\n     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl\n     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and\n     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...\n\n     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.\n\n     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a\n     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.\n\n     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with\n     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.\n     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,\n     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems\n     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and\n     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole\n     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor\n     the girl...\n\n     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the\n     girl, knocking her back on the bed...\n\n     Welles grimaces.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated\n     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes\n     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs\n     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his\n     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs\n     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked\n     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid\n     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...\n\n     Welles rises slowly, still watching.\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves\n     back towards the girl...\n\n     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.\n     WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles\n     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs\n     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his\n     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.\n\n     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.\n     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,\n     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.\n\n     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.\n     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the\n     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her\n     sorrow now shared.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You... you need to go to the police. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I told you I can't, not yet. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 You don't have any other choice. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                       (stands, shakes her head) \n                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of\n                 my husband's name, I need know that\n                 whoever did this will be punished.\n                 If you can find them, I will take\n                 their names to the police.  I'll say\n                 my husband confessed on his death\n                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage\n                 to come forward at first...\n\n                             WELLES \n                 It won't work like that.\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 Any evidence you collect can be\n                 given to the police later,\n                 anonymously.  I've thought about it\n                 and there's no other way.  If you\n                 can't find them... if the only thing\n                 that comes from this film is that\n                 this is all my husband will be\n                 remembered for, well I can't let\n                 that happen.  I'm telling you I\n                 won't.  If there's no chance that\n                 poor girl's memory can be served,\n                 then I'll just have to spend my last\n                 days trying to forget her. \n\n     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate\n                 investigations...\n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 You've found missing persons before. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 Nothing remotely like this. \n\n                             MRS CHRISTIAN \n                 I know what I'm asking.  Your\n                 compensation will be appropriate to\n                 the risk.  You'll need cash to buy\n                 information, and I'll provide it.\n                       (pause)\n                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.\n                       (pause)\n                 You saw what he did to her.\n\n     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the\n     dining room where the projector sits idle.\n\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Cindy is sound asleep in her crib.\n     Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of\n     his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box\n     to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.

They convinced her\n                 to let them buy her a meal in the\n                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have\n                 much to say, but they got a sense\n                 she's a runaway, so all through\n                 dinner the doctor's working on her,\n                 trying to convince her that at the\n                 very least she should pick up a\n                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she\n                 ate her food, excused herself...\n                       (snaps fingers)\n                 That's the last they saw her.  The\n                 reason they came to me for help, the\n                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had\n                 a friend of mine in the department\n                 work up a sketch...\n                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST\n                        SKETCH he photocopied)\n                 They want to see if I can I.D. this\n                 girl, somehow pass along a message\n                 to let the parents know the kid's\n                 alive, doing alright.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or\n                 N.C.M.E.C.? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 I figured you share information. \n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 We do. \n\n                             WELLES \n                 For whatever reasons I thought you\n                 might be more receptive.\n\n                             DIRECTOR \n                 Why don't they come to me? \n\n                             WELLES \n                 This doctor and wife, they're nice\n                 people, but they don't want to get\n                 too involved.

Secretaries tend to other files. \n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n                 It's okay for yours and your\n                 husbands fingerprints to be on the\n                 film, but you'll have to use me as\n                 a middleman if you go to the police.\n                 That way I don't have to explain why\n                 my prints are on it...\n\n     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE\n\n     Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.\n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n                 There were three men.  Two are\n                 obvious; the man in the mask and the\n                 man running the camera, but I caught\n                 a glimpse of a third man in a\n                 mirror.  It's nothing that can be\n                 used for identification, but he was\n                 there, watching...\n\n     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses\n     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,\n     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table\n     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...\n\n     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.\n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n                 So, there were three.  They would\n                 have kept it small, wouldn't have\n                 let anyone in on it they didn't have\n                 to.  That's all for now... except,\n                 I feel I should tell you... with\n                 this looking like it happened at\n                 least five or six years ago...\n\n     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the\n     Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.\n\n                             WELLES (V.O., cont)\n                 Well, it's not very likely we'll\n                 ever find out who this girl was. \n                       (listens) \n                 I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.\n\n     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.\n\n     ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on\n     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and\n     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.\n\n     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE\n\n     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,\n     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.\n\n     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...\n     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR\n     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.\n\n     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,\n     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of\n     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...\n\n     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's\n     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.\n     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     TITLE CARD:      three weeks later\n\n     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY\n\n     In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He\n     tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.\n\n     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled \"North\n     Carolina 1992,\" flipping through picture cards.  The FACES\n     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed\n     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL\n     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...\n     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...\n\n     Welles furrows his brow.\n\n     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.\n\n     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands\n     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed\n     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.\n\n     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the\n     card catalog photo, but it's her.\n\n     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other\n     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his\n     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...\n\n     Writing the girl's name: \"Mary Anne Matthews.\"\n\n\n     EXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway.\n\n     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY\n\n     Another small city.  Blue skies above.\n\n     TITLE:     Fayetteville, North Carolina\n\n     EXT.  PUBLIC LIBRARY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY\n\n     Suburban library.  Kids play hop-scotch in the parking lot.\n\n     INT.  FAYETTEVILLE LIBRARY, MICROFICHE ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old\n     issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined\n     \"Search Continues for Local Teen.\"\n\n     There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same\n     picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.\n\n     Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.\n\n                                              TIME CUT:\n\n     NEWSPRINT SCROLLS past on the MICROFICHE MACHINE, till...\n     \"No Leads in Girl's Disappearance.\"  Same picture.\n     The date at the top: \"July 12, 1992.\"\n\n                                              TIME CUT:\n\n     NEWSPRINT BLURS past... stops on a page of OBITUARIES.\n     Top of the page: \"September 4, 1993.\"\n\n     CLOSE ON: \"Mathews, Robert Steven, 1948-1993.\"\n     \"Dead in an apparent suicide, Robert Mathews was discovered\n     yesterday morning in the basement of...\"\n\n\n     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY\n\n     A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks\n     in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder\n     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his\n     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's\n     registration, other papers and \"Jiffy-Lube\" service reports,\n     uses them to pad the file.\n\n     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He\n     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.\n\n     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY\n\n     Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman\n     answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Yes... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (smiles)\n                 Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's\n                 Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed\n                 investigator...\n\n     Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.\n     Mathews to see it looks official.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I've been hired as an independent\n                 contractor by the U.S. Resource\n                 Center for Missing Persons as part\n                 of an internal audit.  If you have\n                 any time over the next few days, I'd\n                 like to make an appointment to ask\n                 some questions about the\n                 disappearance of your daughter.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 I don't understand, who are... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I'm sorry, let me explain, the\n                 R.C.M.P. is a support organization\n                 and archive, not unlike the Center\n                 for Missing and Exploited Children\n                 in Washington.  I'm sure you've\n                 dealt with them before?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Yes, but... \n\n                             WELLES \n                 These volunteer organizations are\n                 sort of interconnected, functioning\n                 hand in hand with law enforcement.\n                 The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review\n                 their investigations...\n                       (holds up clipboard)\n                 ... fact-check their records, see if\n                 there's anything they missed,\n                 anything they should be doing\n                 different.

It's\n                 not going to effect any ongoing\n                 efforts.  All I'm saying is, please\n                 know, I'm not here to create any\n                 false hope.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 They hired you.

Drinking\n                 whiskey, chasing women and getting\n                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.\n                 Want to know what it's really like? \n                 It's sitting in a car and staring at\n                 a hotel window for three days\n                 straight, pissing in a plastic\n                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy\n                 thinks his wife's cheating on him.\n                 Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who\n                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,\n                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you\n                 could have told him the minute you\n                 laid eyes on him his wife's\n                 cheating, and you don't blame her.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews smiles.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 It's refreshing to actually sit down\n                 and meet someone face to face,\n                 someone nice like you.\n\n     Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles\n     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 So, she didn't leave a note?

For months\n                 there never was any way to get her\n                 to talk about it.  One night we went\n                 to bed... the next morning she was\n                 gone.  She took some clothes.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What was she running from?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 I don't know.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 If there's anything you feel\n                 uncomfortable talking about, tell\n                 me, but I have to ask.  Your\n                 husband... he committed suicide?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Yes.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 September 4th, 1993.

I apologize.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 No one knows what it's like.  You\n                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. \n\n     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at\n     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 People remember me from the news.\n                       (pause)\n                 Can you drive me back now?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Of course. \n\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. \n\n     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS\n     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink\n     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 This is her room.\n\n     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.\n     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a\n     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 The police made a wreck of it, but\n                 I put it back exactly how it was.\n                 Just how she likes it.\n\n     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK\n     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n\n                 Those are for her birthday.  One for\n                 every year she's missed.  They'll be\n                 waiting for her when she comes back. \n\n     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide\n     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of\n                 your time.  Maybe we can finish\n                 tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Okay.\n\n     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull\n     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.\n\n\n     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 You should be able to take a shower\n                 and still have hot water left, honey.\n                       (listens)\n                 Call him back and tell him I said\n                 so.

MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING\n\n     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes\n     coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS \n                 We weren't religious.  We never\n                 forced religion down her throat,\n                 like I've seen some parents do to\n                 their kids.  We never made her go to\n                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,\n                 that's when I got religious.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?\n                 When everything's happy, when life's\n                 fine and you have every reason to\n                 believe there's a God, you don't\n                 bother.  Then, something horrible\n                 happens... that's when you start\n                 praying all the time.  That's when\n                 you start going to church.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 We're all like that.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Are you religious?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 No.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 You should be.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I've got what I need for my report.\n                 There is... there is one thing that\n                 bothers me though.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 What? \n\n                             WELLES\n                 It's not really my place, but it's\n                 not easy for me to set aside the\n                 private detective part of me either.\n                 See, I know a little about missing\n                 persons.  When kids run, they almost\n                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.\n                 They want to say goodbye.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 There wasn't one.  The police looked.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Do you think the police did a good\n                 job?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 I don't know.  I think so.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 It is possible... and I know this\n                 isn't something you want to hear.\n                 Your daughter may have tried to hide\n                 a note where she thought you would\n                 eventually find it, but where she\n                 knew your husband would never find\n                 it.  She might have wanted to tell\n                 you something...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 No.  You don't have any reason to\n                 think that...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 If the police focused their search\n                 in her room, her belongings, well\n                 that'd be only natural, but they may\n                 have been looking in the wrong place.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 How... how can you say that to me...?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Will you let me look?\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 My husband never laid a hand on her.\n                 She would have told me... she would\n                 have told me...\n\n                             WELLES \n                 You're probably right, and I\n                 probably won't find anything.\n                 I don't have a right to ask this,\n                 and you can kick me out of your\n                 house if you want, but this is my\n                 profession and there's a part of me\n                 that can't let it go.  Police are\n                 just as human as you or I.  They\n                 could have missed something.  They\n                 probably didn't.\n                       (pause)\n                 Wouldn't you rather know?\n\n     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I\n                 don't care what you do.\n\n     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.\n\n\n     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY\n\n     -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER\n      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...\n      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes\n      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...\n\n     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE\n      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens\n      CABINETS under the sink...\n\n     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,\n      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch\n      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.\n\n     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high\n      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls\n      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...\n\n     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.\n      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the\n      ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to\n      the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...\n\n      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,\n      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES\n      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...\n      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large\n      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...\n\n      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS\n      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,\n      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.\n      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.\n      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.\n\n      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: \"Mary Anne Mathews.\"\n\n      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of\n      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written\n      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged\n      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the\n      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...\n\n                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                       (emotionless monotone)\n                 \"Dear mom.  If you're reading this,\n                 it means I called you from\n                 Hollywood, California and told you\n                 where to find my diary.  I don't\n                 think I'll be able to tell you this\n                 when I talk to you, so I'm writing\n                 it down here.  You know I haven't\n                 been happy for a long, long time.\n                 For a long time now dad's been doing\n                 things I couldn't tell you.  He's\n                 been touching me and it's getting\n                 worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I\n                 know you and I haven't always gotten\n                 along sometimes, but please don't\n                 blame yourself.  There isn't\n                 anything you can do.  I'm going to\n                 make a whole new life in California.\n                 Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or\n                 in magazines.

MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.\n     Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. \n\n     She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Do you ever consider... do you\n                 realize that Mary may never come\n                 back?\n\n     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS\n                 I think about it everyday.

Oh, and, don't call\n                 me \"pops.\"\n\n     Welles walks away. \n\n\n     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by\n     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at\n     the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone...\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 ...

DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT\n\n     Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,\n     Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,\n     smaller, older, darker buildings...\n\n     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT\n\n     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY\n     CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted\n     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.\n\n     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands\n     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.\n\n                             MAX\n                 Come on.\n\n     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.\n\n     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between\n     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading\n     down to pitch dark...\n\n     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT\n\n     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,\n     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.\n\n     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,\n     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. \n\n                             GOON\n                 Are you a law enforcement agent or\n                 in any way affiliated with law\n                 enforcement?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Fuck you, Larry.\n\n     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.\n\n                             GOON\n                       (to Welles)\n                 Are you a law enforcement... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 No.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT\n\n     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind\n     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly\n     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The\n     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so \"CUSTOMERS\"\n     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous\n     porn shops look like high society.\n\n     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot\n     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members\n     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in\n     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.\n\n                             ONE DEALER\n                 We're shutting down in fifteen\n                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.\n\n     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is\n     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of\n     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is\n     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.\n\n     Welles swallows back disgust.\n\n     The next table is piled high with used pornographic\n     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.\n     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.\n\n     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.\n\n     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks\n     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,\n     \"two,\" \"sixteen,\" \"five.\"  And many bootleg VIDEOS with\n     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.\n\n     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN\n     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.\n     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry\n     looking DEALER who's counting money.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (points to numbered videos)\n                 What are these?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.\n                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.\n\n     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Anything harder?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 There's nothing harder.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Snuff?\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 What you see is what I got, mister.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You know where I can get it?  I have\n                 a lot of money to spend.\n\n                             ANGRY DEALER\n                 There ain't no such thing as snuff.\n                 Why don't you fuck off? \n\n     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.\n     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED\n     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...\n\n     INSIDE THE CURTAIN\n\n     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent\n     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag\n     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an\n     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.\n\n     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,\n     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent\n     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.\n\n     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.\n\n                             LARGE MAN\n                 You have to pay to come in here. \n\n     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.\n\n\n     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT\n\n     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max\n     eats a huge breakfast.\n\n                             MAX\n                 You've got Penthouse, Playboy,\n                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers\n                 them pornography anymore.  Then,\n                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple\n                 X.  The difference is penetration.\n                 That's hardcore.  That whole\n                 industry's up in the valley.\n                 Writers, directors, porn stars.\n                 They're celebrities, or they think\n                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos\n                 a week.  A week.  They've even got\n                 a porno Academy Awards.  America\n                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells\n                 you they never use pornography,\n                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying\n                 those videos.  Somebody's out there\n                 spending 900 million dollars a year\n                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's\n                 only gonna get worse.  More and more\n                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming\n                 into the mainstream, because that's\n                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my\n                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his\n                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,\n                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around\n                 in thong bikinis with their asses\n                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For\n                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big\n                 enough after a while.  They have to\n                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn\n                 chicks are putting in breast\n                 implants bigger than your head,\n                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be\n                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,\n                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore\n                 films'll be medical films.\n                 People'll be jerking off to women\n                 laying around with open wounds.\n                 There's nowhere else for it to go.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Interesting theory.\n\n                             MAX\n                 What you saw tonight, we're not\n                 talking about a video some dentist\n                 takes home over the weekend.  We're\n                 talking about stuff where people get\n                 hurt.  Specialty product. \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Child pornography.\n\n                             MAX\n                 There's two kinds of specialty\n                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot\n                 fetish, shit films, watersports,\n                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-\n                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond\n                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the\n                 kind of hardcore where one guy's\n                 going to look at it and throw up,\n                 another guy looks at it and falls in\n                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and\n                 bondage films, they straddle the\n                 line.  How are you supposed to tell\n                 if the person tied up with the ball\n                 gag in their mouth is a consenting\n                 or not?  Step over that line, you're\n                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but\n                 there aren't many.  I've never seen\n                 one.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Snuff films.\n\n                             MAX\n                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't\n                 yanking you around.  There's no such\n                 thing.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What other ways are there to get\n                 illegal films?  Who do you see?\n\n                             MAX\n                 First of all, basement sales like\n                 tonight aren't gonna last much\n                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and\n                 two, everything's going on the\n                 internet.  Anyone with a computer\n                 and enough patience can find\n                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for\n                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.\n                 They're swapping pictures back and\n                 forth as fast as their modems can\n                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some\n                 weird shit under the counter where\n                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where\n                 it comes from.  That's local\n                 underground, where information\n                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are\n                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their\n                 hands are permanently pruned.  They\n                 go out in the sun they don't burn,\n                 they blister.  Other than that, all\n                 I know about is the mail.\n                 Classified ads in the paper with\n                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.\n                 Credit card orders to dummy\n                 corporations.  Interstate wire\n                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.\n                 But, if you're asking me who do you\n                 go to to get illegal shit... who\n                 knows?  That's the whole point --\n                 the seller stays as far away from\n                 the buyer as possible, and vice\n                 versa, and cops can't trace the\n                 deal.  There's ways to do it so\n                 nobody knows who anybody is.\n\n     Welles watches Max eat.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 How old are you?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Twenty-five.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Where are your parents?\n\n                             MAX\n                 I don't know, where are yours?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I don't mean any offense... but what\n                 are you doing mixed up in all this?\n\n                             MAX\n                 I'm not mixed up in anything,\n                 hayseed.

He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into\n     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation\n     growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.\n\n     Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS\n     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of\n     Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...\n\n     ... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.\n     Welles comes to study this third photo.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     INT.

Another's stuffed with\n     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.\n\n     Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.

He attaches the\n     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.\n\n     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the\n     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-\n     picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.\n\n     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens\n     another.

He\n     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs\n     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back\n     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.\n\n     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Come on, Eddie...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.\n\n                             WELLES (O.S.)\n                 ... come on...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a\n     NUMBER.

Welles runs his finger down the page.\n\n     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY\n\n     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY\n     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles\n     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder\n     with other buildings, labeled \"1204\" in burnished steel.\n\n     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.\n\n     The top button's labeled \"Greystone Imports,\" the bottom\n     button reads \"Lang Interior Design, by appt.\"  The middle\n     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.\n\n     Welles looks up at the building.\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY\n\n     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans\n     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.\n\n     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed\n     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel\n     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...\n\n     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.\n\n     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they\n     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the\n     door before it closes.\n\n     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY\n\n     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One\n     woman hits \"2.\"  Welles hits \"3,\" steps back in the corner.\n     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made\n     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.\n\n     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises\n     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.\n\n     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get\n     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS\n     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.\n\n     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another\n     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of\n     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.\n\n     Welles lets the elevator close.\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.

FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with\n     fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.\n     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.\n\n     Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing\n     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.

He picks another Dino Velvet\n     TAPE, puts it in, sits.\n\n     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of\n     Klansmen around a burning cross...

Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in\n     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound\n     woman, struggling.

On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket\n     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,\n     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. \n\n                             MAX\n                 Why?

Max sits up, watching.\n\n     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her\n     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...\n\n     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.\n     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...\n\n     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...\n\n     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV\n     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...\n\n     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.\n     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch\n     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked\n     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Who is he?\n\n                             MAX\n                 I told you, he's one of Dino\n                 Velvet's stock players...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Who is he, his name?\n\n                             MAX\n                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his\n                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You\n                 never see his face.  He calls\n                 himself \"Machine,\" that's what they\n                 call him.  Machine. \n\n     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and\n     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with\n     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.\n\n                             MAX\n                 They say he's half brain-dead from\n                 all the steroids he's using.\n\n     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.\n\n                             MAX\n                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.

At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the\n     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in\n     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.\n\n     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the\n     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands\n     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.\n\n\n     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.

TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD\n     gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.

Max drinks beer.\n     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit\n     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.\n\n                             MAX\n                 What's next?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I'm trying to figure that out\n                 myself.

The woman I got\n                 it from is never going to give it a\n                 second thought.  Let's not make a\n                 big deal out of this, okay? \n                       (pause)\n                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for\n                 President.

Max watches him go,\n     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.\n\n     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.\n\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY\n\n     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied\n     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles\n     drives through, watchful.\n\n     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.\n     He parks the car.\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all\n     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...\n\n     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to\n     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.\n\n     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a\n     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 There you are.  Come join us.\n\n     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is\n     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M\n     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.\n\n     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.\n\n     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the\n     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS\n     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...\n\n     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets\n     closer, he notices several things ... \n\n     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along\n     with several movie LIGHTS\n\n     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside\n     a pair of HANDCUFFS...\n\n     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...\n\n     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his\n     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.\n     Machine's still staring at Welles.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (to Machine)\n                 Hello.\n\n     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 You brought the money?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (takes out envelope)\n                 Right here.\n\n     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then\n     turns to look at Welles with a smile.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Excellent.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Where are the women?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 They should be here any minute.\n\n     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the\n     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (of the knifes)\n                 What are these for?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just\n                 props.  Nice, aren't they?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Sure.\n\n     Dino walks across towards the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Machine and I were just talking\n                 about knifes.  The beauty of\n                 knifes...\n\n     Dino pulls arrows from the target.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 He was saying how fascinated he is\n                 by their simple ability to be sharp.\n                 The ability of a piece of metal to\n                 be so thin that it is almost\n                 nothing...\n\n     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the\n     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 So close to nothingness that it cuts\n                 with minimum effort, because it's so\n                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It\n                 blooms open as the blade widens, but\n                 by then it's too late, because the\n                 knife's already doing its pure,\n                 simple damage.\n\n     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.\n     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the\n     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted\n     windows drives in...\n\n     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays\n     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.\n\n     Machine stands.  He is a giant.\n     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.\n\n     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.\n\n     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at\n     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Mister Welles... would you be so\n                 kind as to remove any firearms from\n                 your person?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What are you... ?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Take out your gun!\n\n     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Slowly.  Let me see it.\n\n     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he\n     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Empty the gun onto the table, very\n                 carefully.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Look, I don't know what this...\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,\n                 or I'll put this arrow through your\n                 throat.\n\n     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.\n\n     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Is that him?\n\n                             DINO VELVET\n                       (to Welles)\n                 Put the gun down, take the\n                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the\n                 bed.\n\n     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.\n     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the\n     other cuff around his wrist.

Be a man.\n\n     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the\n     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... \n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me!\n\n     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,\n     looks at the Thomas Guide.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me where you did it, on the\n                 map, exactly where you did it.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Why?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Because we're going there.\n\n\n     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards\n     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.\n\n     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up\n     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK\n\n     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by\n     wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE\n     ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.\n\n     Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.\n\n     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels\n     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown\n     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken\n     neon and peeled paint: \"Big Bear Motor Lodge.\"\n\n     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...\n\n     ON THE ROADWAY\n\n     Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes\n     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.\n\n     Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns\n     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the\n     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center\n     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.\n\n     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out\n     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is\n     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles turns out headlights and parks.\n     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.\n     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the\n     forest as the CAR PASSES.\n\n     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.\n     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.\n     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles\n     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.\n\n     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the\n     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's\n     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.\n\n     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is\n     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the\n     snuff film, without the furniture.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What are we doing here?\n\n     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on\n     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...\n\n     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and\n     Welles' palely lit face.\n\n                             WELLES \n                 That night... you didn't have to be\n                 in the room, but you were.\n                       (looks to Eddie)\n                 Why?  Why did you watch?\n\n     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I\n                 never saw anyone get done before.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You enjoy it? \n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Made me sick, but what did I care?\n                 What did I care if some hump wants\n                 to beat off to that.  It was just\n                 something I was doing for money.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Tell me what happened.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What do you want to know?  You saw\n                 it, you saw the loop...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Nobody saw you bring her in?\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 There wasn't nobody around.  This\n                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up\n                 the car to the door and we carried\n                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made\n                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid\n                 out the plastic, put film in the\n                 camera and Machine went to work.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 What did you do with her body?\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Took it out the bathroom window.\n                 Buried it in the woods.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me.\n\n     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned\n     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and\n     flashlight, into the dense forest...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What are you thinking you're gonna\n                 do... ?\n\n     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Keep moving.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Where do you think you're taking\n                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,\n                 avenge that little girl's death?\n                 Gonna make everything right with the\n                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? \n\n     FURTHER ON\n\n     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You can't go to the cops.  All you\n                 can do is cut me loose and walk\n                 away, because you got nothing...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Stop talking.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You got absolute zero.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Show me where you buried her.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I don't know...\n                       (nods to forest)\n                 ... out there somewhere.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Where?  Show me where.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I fucking don't know.  What do you\n                 think... we weren't burying\n                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so\n                 we could come back and get it.  We\n                 dug a hole and we put her in it.\n                 Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his\n     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever\n                 will, and even if they did, it\n                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the\n                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em\n                 all.  Without the film, it never\n                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's\n                 over.  You can't do anything.\n\n     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out\n                 here, just like you left her.\n\n     Eddie's not backing down.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Do it.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Don't think I won't.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so\n                 I don't have to listen to you\n                 whining anymore.  You think it's so\n                 easy?\n\n                             WELLES\n                 Easy enough for you.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 I never killed anyone.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 That's right, you just stood there\n                 and watched, because you \"felt like\n                 it.\"  Almost makes you worse.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 What do you want?  You want me to\n                 fall to my knees and start crying\n                 like a baby... ?\n\n     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Where you going?  You're the one\n                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless\n                 enough?  Come on...\n\n     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with\n                 that gun, your gun, right,\n                 registered in your name?  Dig the\n                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,\n                 bury the body with your bullets in\n                 it.  Fucking do it!\n\n     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's\n     forehead, pulls back the hammer... \n\n     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.\n\n     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage\n     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...\n\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit\n     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,\n     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 You pussy.\n\n     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,\n     till Eddie's securely bound.\n\n     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...\n\n                             EDDIE\n                 Fucking pussy!\n\n     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his\n     wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds\n     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.\n\n     He looks back to the motel room.\n\n     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR\n     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at\n     it in his hand.\n\n     IN THE LOT\n\n     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,\n     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.\n\n     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.\n     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,\n     pages through, studies one page.\n\n     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,\n     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...\n\n                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)\n                       (from phone)\n                 Hello... ?\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Mrs. Mathews?

She's been dead all\n                 this time...\n\n     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.\n     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there\n                 wasn't anything anyone could do...\n\n     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the\n     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,\n     gasping, sucking air...\n\n     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing\n     it to fuel his rage...\n\n     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the\n     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks\n     towards the motel room...\n\n     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and\n     the door falls...\n\n     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...\n\n     The door SLAMS to the floor.\n\n     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his\n     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...\n\n     Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...\n\n     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...\n\n     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and\n     distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS\n     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting\n     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.\n\n     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying\n     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered\n     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.\n\n     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and\n     goes to his car...\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun\n     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his\n     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. \n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles enters and crosses through...\n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts\n     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,\n     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.\n\n     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of\n     Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...\n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents\n     onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's\n     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...\n\n     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching.  He finds\n     POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...\n\n     EXT.

LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking\n     out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...\n\n     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He\n     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the\n     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle\n     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.\n\n\n     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a\n     CHECK-IN COUNTER. \n\n     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her\n     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.\n\n     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...\n\n     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.\n\n                             AGENT\n                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed\n                 through to Kennedy.

MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT\n\n     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a\n     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...\n\n     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,\n     white pages, finds... \"HOSPITALS.\"\n\n     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Hello, can you connect me with the\n                 duty nurse?\n                      (waits)\n                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson\n                 down here in the Thirteenth\n                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva\n                 problem I was hoping you could give\n                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing\n                 incident a couple of days ago, and\n                 it looks like the supposed victim\n                 gave us a false name and address.\n                 Can you tell me if you had an adult\n                 male with an abdominal wound in you\n                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?\n                       (listens)\n                 You'd remember this guy; a body-\n                 builder, real big guy, five foot\n                 eleven, with acne all over his chest\n                 and back...\n                       (listens)\n                 Alright, thanks for your help. \n\n     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the\n     phone book, starts dialing the next number.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.

You'd know him\n                 if you saw him... \n\n     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles\n     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 He's a body-builder, stands just\n                 under six feet...\n\n     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 That's right... covered in acne.\n                 That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,\n                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus\n                 report on this stabbing, gave us a\n                 false name and address...\n                       (listens)\n                 Yes, I'll hold.\n\n     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts\n     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone\n     book, searching, looks under the desk...\n\n     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.\n\n                             WELLES\n                       (into phone)\n                 Yes... yes.\n                       (sits, writing in pad)\n                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-\n                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.\n                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.\n\n     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.\n\n\n     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY\n\n     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two\n     story affairs, close together, each very much like its\n     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.\n\n     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in\n     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.\n\n     Welles parallel parks.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles turns off the engine.\n     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The\n     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,\n     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a\n     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.\n\n     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children\n     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his\n     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side\n     mirror, rolling up the window.\n\n     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,\n     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG\n     off the passenger seat and opens it.\n\n     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink\n     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.\n\n     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles\n     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along\n     the gun's inner barrel.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY\n\n     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.\n     He looks in his side mirror...\n\n     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn\n     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.\n\n     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint\n     house begins to open. \n\n     Welles watches...\n     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back\n     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.\n     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.\n\n     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's\n     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the\n     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the\n     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.\n\n     Welles watches.\n\n     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.\n     The garage door closes behind her.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one\n     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.\n\n     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.\n\n     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture\n     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old\n     woman comes to sit at a table.\n\n     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...\n\n     THROUGH BINOCULARS\n\n     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.\n     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of\n     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...\n\n     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge\n     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our\n     view, so we never see his face.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.\n\n     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen\n     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old\n     woman smiles up at him, says something.\n\n     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,\n     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.\n\n     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a\n     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman\n     starts to eat.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY\n\n     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,\n     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.\n\n     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He\n     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.\n\n     ACROSS THE STREET\n\n     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.\n\n     IN THE CAR\n\n     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...\n     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's\n     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.\n\n     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.\n\n     ON THE STREET\n\n     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind\n     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all\n     directions, making sure no one's around.\n\n     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.\n\n     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too\n     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...\n\n     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get\n     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.\n\n     ABOVE\n\n     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out\n     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY\n\n     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.\n     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves\n     towards the door to the house.\n\n     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes\n     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push\n     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,\n     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.\n\n     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY\n\n     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is\n     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING\n     MACHINE. \n\n     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two\n     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...\n\n     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a\n     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,\n     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his\n     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.\n     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT\n     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL\n     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.\n\n     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the\n     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of\n     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.\n\n     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old\n     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,\n     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into\n     the living room area...\n\n     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear\n     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.\n     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\n     Welles creeps up the stairs...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.\n     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and\n     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.\n\n     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS\n     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...\n\n     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a\n     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,\n     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and\n     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD\n     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the\n     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...\n\n     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...\n     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...\n\n     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the\n     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.\n\n     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy\n     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.\n     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.\n\n     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...\n\n     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY\n\n     Welles turns...\n     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE\n     KNIFE raised to kill...\n\n     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...\n\n     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine\n     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...\n\n     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand\n     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...\n\n     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the\n     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...\n\n     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible\n     knife is inches away...\n\n     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance\n     from the blade...\n\n     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the\n     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins\n     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...\n\n     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...\n\n     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun\n     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...\n\n     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...\n\n     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,\n     FIRES his gun...\n\n     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!\n\n     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free\n     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,\n     bleeding from bullet fragments...\n\n     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.\n\n     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed\n     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...\n     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...\n     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. \n\n     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'\n     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the\n     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...\n\n     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!\n\n     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already\n     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...\n\n     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles\n     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...\n\n     Machine rises, charging after...\n\n     ON THE STAIRCASE\n\n     Welles is TACKLED from behind...\n     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the\n     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...\n\n     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the\n     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...\n\n     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...\n     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips\n     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...\n\n     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,\n     pushes Machine back, letting go...\n\n     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands\n     and knees, scrambling...\n\n     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...\n     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING\n     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...\n\n     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,\n     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...\n\n     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...\n\n     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...\n     Machine gets to his feet...\n\n     IN THE KITCHEN\n\n     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...\n     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...\n\n     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins\n     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...\n\n     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...\n\n     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...\n\n     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen\n     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.\n\n     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the\n     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...\n     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...\n\n     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,\n     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...\n     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...\n\n     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets\n     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles\n     airway with his forearm...\n\n     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one\n     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...\n     frantically feeling for anything he can use...\n\n     Welles' face is blood red...\n\n     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...\n\n     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!\n\n     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching\n     around to the fork...\n\n     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...\n\n     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling\n     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.\n\n     Welles gets to his feet, looking...\n     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both\n     hands and moving towards Machine...\n\n     Machine's getting up...\n     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of\n     the frying pan...\n\n     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!\n\n     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...\n\n     IN THE BASEMENT\n\n     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the\n     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all\n     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...\n\n     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of\n     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching\n     desperately, throwing clothing aside...\n\n     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...\n\n     Welles searches the laundry pile... \n\n     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for\n     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...\n     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking\n     Machine a few steps backwards...\n\n     Welles FIRES...\n\n     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging\n     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...\n\n     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.\n\n     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an\n     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.\n\n     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get\n     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,\n     walking to Machine...\n\n     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line\n     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...\n\n     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...\n\n     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles\n     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,\n     pulling the clothes line with all his might...\n\n     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.\n\n     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,\n     struggling... till he finally stops moving.\n\n     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,\n     trembling.  He looks around the basement.\n\n     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his\n     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.\n\n     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling\n     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...\n\n     Welles stares down at Machine.  We never see Machine's face.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks\n     around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still\n     holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.\n\n     EXT.

Amy's at the\n     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.\n\n     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns\n     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,\n     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.\n\n                             AMY\n                 How much forgiveness do you think I\n                 have in me?\n\n     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his\n     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I can't talk about it yet... not\n                 yet.\n\n     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.

SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY\n\n     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.\n     He takes out his wallet, opens it.\n\n     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into\n     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.\n     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles\n     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. \n\n     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He\n     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.\n\n     EXT.

WELLES' FORD -- DAY\n\n     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches\n     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.\n\n     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL\n     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.\n\n     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The\n     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.\n\n     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with\n     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His\n     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting\n     out a loud WAIL of misery...\n\n     EXT.

WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS\n\n     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and\n     over again, wiping at his tears.

Amy looks up\n     momentarily, then returns to reading.\n\n     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting\n     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's\n     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands\n     there, eyes red from crying.\n\n                             AMY\n                 Tom... ?\n\n     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to\n     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around\n     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 I have to tell you... I have to tell\n                 you what happened.  I have to tell\n                 you everything, but we can't tell\n                 anyone else.  No one else can ever\n                 know.\n\n     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest\n     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.\n     Welles holds tighter.\n\n                             WELLES\n                 You're all I've got.
