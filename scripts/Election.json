MILLARD GYMNASIUM DAY\n\t\n\tThe entire student body is assembled on the bleachers. There is a \n\tpalpable mood of boredom and apathy.\n\t\n\tJERRY SLAVIN, a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, is  at the \n\tmicrophone. His head lists to one side, and he takes  long breaths as \n\the speaks.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t\tI love Millard High, and I will be a \n\t\t\tdedicated vice President. A vote for \n\t\t\tJerry Slavin is a vote for good \n\t\t\tgovernment. And even if I can't really \n\t\t\tstand up for you, I will.\n\t\t\t\t\t(cracks himself up)\n\t\t\tThank you.\n\t\n\tJerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs.  JIM steps \n\tforward, clapping, and raises the mike.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tThank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, \n\t\t\tJerry is running unopposed for Vice \n\t\t\tPresident. So we'll move on now to the \n\t\t\tpresidential race with three candidates \n\t\t\trunning. The first in alphabetical order \n\t\t\tis Tracy Flick.\n\t\n\tTracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. During her \n\tspeech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tPoet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, \"I \n\t\t\tcannot make my days longer, so I strive \n\t\t\tto make them better.\"  With this \n\t\t\telection, we here at Millard also have \n\t\t\tan opportunity to make our high school \n\t\t\tdays better.  During this campaign I \n\t\t\thave had the opportunity to speak with \n\t\t\tmany of you about your concerns.  I \n\t\t\tspoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who \n\t\t\ttold me how alienated she feels from her \n\t\t\town homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore \n\t\t\tReggie Banks, who said his mother works \n\t\t\tin a cafeteria and can't afford to buy \n\t\t\thim enough spiral notebooks for his \n\t\t\tclasses.  I won't bore you with long-\n\t\t\twinded promises about all the new and \n\t\t\tinnovative things I will definitely \n\t\t\tachieve during the year in which it will \n\t\t\tbe my honor and privilege to represent \n\t\t\teach and every one of you, but I can say \n\t\t\tthat my years of experience on the \n\t\t\tstudent council have taught me the three \n\t\t\tmost important attributes the president \n\t\t\tneeds to possess;  commitment -\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDOUG SCHENKEN\n\t\t\tEat me\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDOUG'S BUDDY \n\t\t\tEat me raw!\n\t\n\tThere is  scattered laughter. Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up \n\tand grabs the mike.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWALT\n\t\t\tIf you can't be adults and give these \n\t\t\tcandidates the courtesy they deserve, \n\t\t\tthen you don't deserve to be called \n\t\t\tadults but children* Because that's what \n\t\t\tchildren are. And you'll be treated like \n\t\t\tchildren. So let's all listen up.\n\t\n\tWalt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tThe three most important attributes the \n\t\t\tpresident needs to possess are: \n\t\t\tcommitment, qualifications, and \n\t\t\texperience.  I'll add one more; caring.  \n\t\t\tI care about Millard, and I care about \n\t\t\teach and every one of you, and together \n\t\t\twe can all make a difference.  One of \n\t\t\tthe things I would like to establish is \n\t\t\ta regular open forum where any student \n\t\t\tcan come and voice their concern about \n\t\t\tissues we face here at Millard.  I and \n\t\t\tthe rest of the student council would \n\t\t\tthen interface with the faculty and \n\t\t\tstaff, so a continuous dialogue would \n\t\t\texist.\n\t\n\tWalt whispers to Jim.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWALT\n\t\t\tI'd say she knows a thing or two about \n\t\t\tstudent-faculty dialogue.\n\t\n\tJIM nods solemnly\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tWhen you cast your vote for Tracy Flick \n\t\t\tnext week, you won't just be voting for \n\t\t\tme.  You'll be voting for yourself and \n\t\t\tfor every other student Our days won't \n\t\t\tbe any longer, but they can sure be \n\t\t\tbetter.  Thank you.\n\t\n\tTracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair.  There is polite \n\tapplause and a few whistles.  JJJB comes back to the microphone.\n\t\n\tTracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him.  Paul scares \n\tstraight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs \n\tis jiggling.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tThe next candidate for student body \n\t\t\tpresident is Paul Metzier.  Paul?\n\t\n\tPaul awkwardly makes his way to the mike.   Though by no means \n\tthunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's.  A small cluster of \n\tjocks \"woof\" for him, shaking their fists in the air.  Paul manages a \n\tweak grin for his buddies.\n\t\n\tTracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced\n\t\n\tLisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him \n\tencouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked \n\tabout.\n\t\n\tTammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals \n\tnothing.\n\t\n\tThe applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look \n\tat the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible \n\tmonotone, never once glancing up.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\tAs many of you know I broke my leg \n\t\t\tpretty bad thi3 year and the experience \n\t\t\thas made me reevaluate what I want to do \n\t\t\twith my life and that is help people \n\t\t\twhen you think about it a school is more \n\t\t\tthan a school it's our second home where \n\t\t\twe spend all cur time and grow as \n\t\t\tindividuals and a community but is our \n\t\t\tschool everything it could be I want our \n\t\t\tschool to reach its true potential that \n\t\t\tis why I am running for president.\n\t\n\tJIM pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained\n\t\n\tA few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a \n\tstern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\tI know what it is to fight hard and win \n\t\t\tlike when we almost went to state last \n\t\t\tfall and I threw that fourth-quarter \n\t\t\tpass against Westside for the touchdown \n\t\t\tthat won the game by three points I \n\t\t\twon't let you down like I didn't then I \n\t\t\tpromise we can all score a winning\n\t\t\t\t\t(big breath)\n\t\t\ttouchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier \n\t\t\tfor president thank you.\n\t\n\tPaul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain \n\tloyal.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tOkay, Paul. Now our final candidate for \n\t\t\tPresident - another one of the Metzier \n\t\t\tclan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.\n\t\n\tTammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and \n\tcatcalls.\n\t\n\tTammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside. \n\tShe makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWALT \n\t\t\tPeople.

You think \n\t\t\tit's going to change anything around \n\t\t\there, make one single person happier or \n\t\t\tsmarter or nicer? The only person it \n\t\t\tmatters to is the one who gets elected.  \n\t\t\tThe same pathetic charade happens every \n\t\t\tyear, and everyone makes the same \n\t\t\tpathetic promises just so they can put \n\t\t\tit on their transcripts to get into \n\t\t\tcollege.  So vote for me, because I \n\t\t\tdon't even want to go to college, and I \n\t\t\tdon't care, and as president I won't do \n\t\t\tanything.  The only promise I make is \n\t\t\tthat if elected I will immediately \n\t\t\tdismantle the student government, so \n\t\t\tthat none of us will ever have to sit \n\t\t\tthrough one of these stupid assemblies \n\t\t\tagain!\n\t\n\tThere is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause.  \n\tTammy has set them free.

Tracy is \n\tclearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks \n\tconfused and ashamed.  Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and \n\tchants along with the multitude.\n\t\n\tTammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTAMMY\n\t\t\t0h don't vote for me I  Who cares? \n\t\t\tDon't vote at all!\n\t\n\tThe students go nuts.\n\t\n\tINT.

You know, instead \n\t\t\tof wasting time interrogating me, we \n\t\t\tshould be out there trying to find out \n\t\t\twho did this.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tOkay, Tracy, so who do you think did \n\t\t\tit?  Whom should we \"interrogate?\"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\twell, I don't know.  It could have been \n\t\t\tanybody.  There are a lot of, you know, \n\t\t\tsubversive elements around Millard.  You \n\t\t\tknow, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck \n\t\t\tand those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken -\n\t\t\twhat about him?  Or what about Tammy\n\t\t\tMetzier?  Her whole thing is being anti-\n\t\t\tthis and anti-that.\n\t\n\tJIM shifts gears\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tYou're a very intelligent girl, Tracy.  \n\t\t\tYou have many admirable qualities.  But \n\t\t\tsomeday maybe you'll learn that being \n\t\t\tsmart and always being on top and doing \n\t\t\twhatever you need to do to get ahead, \n\t\t\tand yes, stepping on people to get \n\t\t\tthere, well, there's a lot more to life \n\t\t\tthan that.  And in the end, you're only \n\t\t\tcheating yourself.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tWhy are you lecturing me?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tThis isn't the time or the place to get \n\t\t\tinto it, but there is, for just one \n\t\t\texample, a certain former colleague of \n\t\t\tmine, who made a very big mistake, a \n\t\t\tlife mistake.  I think the lesson there \n\t\t\tis that, old and young, we ail make \n\t\t\tmistakes, and we have to learn that our \n\t\t\tactions, all of them, can carry serious \n\t\t\tconsequences.  You're very young, Tracy \n\t\t\tunderage, in fact -- but maybe one\n\t\t\tday you'll understand.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tI don't know what you're referring to, \n\t\t\tbut I do know that if certain older and \n\t\t\twiser people hadn't acted like such \n\t\t\tlittle babies and gotten all mushy, \n\t\t\teverything would be okay.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tI agree.  But I also think certain \n\t\t\tyoung and naive people need to thank \n\t\t\ttheir lucky stars and be very, very \n\t\t\tgrateful the whole school didn't find \n\t\t\tout about certain indiscretions which \n\t\t\tcould have ruined their reputations, and \n\t\t\tchances to win certain elections.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tAnd I think certain older persons like \n\t\t\tyou and your \"colleague\" shouldn't be \n\t\t\tleaching after their students, \n\t\t\tespecially when some of them can't even \n\t\t\tget their own wives pregnant.  And they \n\t\t\tcertainly shouldn't be running around \n\t\t\tmaking slanderous accusations.  \n\t\t\tEspecially when certain young, naive \n\t\t\tpeople's mothers are para-legal \n\t\t\tsecretaries at the city's biggest law \n\t\t\tfirm and have won many successful \n\t\t\tlawsuits. And if you want to keep \n\t\t\tquestioning me like this, I won't \n\t\t\tcontinue without my attorney present.\n\t\n\tJIM draws a long breath as he tries to control himself\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tOkay, Tracy.

And what year was that?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDALE\n\t\t\t1958?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMR. FLAGG\n\t\t\tAlmost.  1957.  So the point here is \n\t\t\twhen we found out about Sputnik, we got \n\t\t\treally scared.  It seemed like no matter \n\t\t\twhat we had and kept secret, they could \n\t\t\tdevelop it too.  A-bombs, h-bombs, \n\t\t\trocket ships.  And this time we were \n\t\t\tbehind them.  So -- February 1961, \n\t\t\tKennedy tells Congress and the American \n\t\t\tpeople he wants to go to the moon.  May \n\t\t\t1961, the Apollo program is announced...\n\t\n\tTracy just can't take it anymore.  She abruptly stands up, takes the \n\tGIANT HALL PASS off the lip of the blackboard, and starts to leave.  \n\tMr. Flagg gives her a small nod.\n\t\n\tINT.  RAILWAY\tDAY\n\t\n\tTracy nears a room, a special room.  She slows down and peeks in the \n\twindow of the door.  She sees --\n\t\n\tLARRY FOUCH  sitting at the back of the classroom, staring front.  \n\tTracy presses her face to see what Larry is staring at --\n\t\n\tJIM at his desk counting ballots\n\t\n\tLARRY catches sight of Tracy in the window.\n\t\n\tTRACY crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look\n\t\n\tLARRY sneaks a guilty look at Jim, absorbed in his counting.  Then, \n\tagainst his better judgment flashes Tracy a quick, furtive double \n\tTHUMBS-UP.\n\t\n\tTRACY suddenly disappears from the window.\n\t\n\tIN THE EMPTY HALLWAY - Tracy pogos with unbridled joy\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY (VO)\n\t\t\tYou know that moment when they announce \n\t\t\tthe winner of a beauty pageant?  When \n\t\t\tMiss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes \n\t\t\tshe's Miss America, and all she can do \n\t\t\tis scream and weep and hug the losers?  \n\t\t\tI had my moment in the hallway that \n\t\t\tTuesday afternoon with no one to hug but \n\t\t\tmyself.\n\t\n\tShe pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the \n\tOTHER DOOR to Jim's classroom, the window behind which JIM\n\tis still busily doing his count.\n\t\n\tINT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY\n\t\n\tJIM counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to \n\thimself.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM (VO)\n\t\t\tI was at the end of my count when it \n\t\t\thappened.  I'd come up with exactly the \n\t\t\tsame numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won \n\t\t\tthe election by a single vote, 256 to \n\t\t\t257.  I was about to announce my tally \n\t\t\twhen...  \n\t\n\tJIM looks up and sees\n\t\n\tTRACY in the window, her face exploding with joy.  She FREEZES.\n\t\n\tWe move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION.  What actually occurs in a \n\tsplit-second is suspended in time\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM (VO CONT'D)\n\t\t\tThe sight of Tracy at that moment \n\t\t\taffected me in a way I can't fully \n\t\t\texplain.  Part of it was that she was \n\t\t\tspying, but mostly it was her face. \n\t\t\tLooking at her, you might think she was \n\t\t\ta sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she \n\t\t\twasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent. \n\t\t\tShe was selfish and cynical and \n\t\t\tambitious and thought nothing of \n\t\t\tdestroying the lives of others to get to \n\t\t\tthe top. who knew how high she would \n\t\t\tclimb in life, how many people would \n\t\t\tsuffer because of her? I had to stop her \n\t\t\tnow.\n\t\n\tTracy UNFREEZES and darts out of sight. JIM glances at Larry. Larry is \n\twriting in a notebook.\n\t\n\tJIM'S HAND\n\t\n\tcreeps up from his lap and onto the pile of TRACY VOTES.  His fingers \n\tnimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk.\n\t\n\tJIM coughs as beneath his desk he CRUMPLES THE BALLOTS into a ball and \n\tdrops them into the wastepaper basket.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tLarry?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY \n\t\t\t\t\t(looking up) \n\t\t\tYeah?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t\tI think we've got a problem.\n\t\n\tINT.

I think that's the \n\t\t\tcase with all the candidates you see \n\t\t\tbefore you today.  All of them are \n\t\t\thighly qualified and embody the, uh, the \n\t\t\tintegrity we expect from our school \n\t\t\tleadership.\n\t\n\tOS TRACY - Jim's voice momentarily recedes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY (VO)\n\t\t\tAct surprised.
