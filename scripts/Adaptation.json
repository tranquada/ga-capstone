The men turn into mannequins.\nThe floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp\nwater. The swamp turns to cardboard, with real orchids\nhanging from the trees. A guy carrying some orchids walks on\ntop of the cellophane, past the mannequins.\n\nINT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is dark, lit only by the light of the TV Laroche's\nfather watches.

Laroche's face\nsmacks against the steering wheel, his front teeth fly in all\ndirections. His mother rockets forward smashing through the\nwindshield. His uncle hits Laroche's wife in the head,\njerking her forward and landing on top of her.\n\nEXT.

Then the hurricane\n          destroyed my greenhouse. Everything. I\n          knew it would break my heart to start\n          another nursery, so when the Seminoles\n          wanted a white guy, an expert, to get\n          their nursery going, I took it.\n\nINT.

I\n          mean, most people's lives don't include a\n          lot of drama and I wanted to sort of be\n          compelling without having to resort to\n          big, um...

ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING\n\nOrlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida.\nShe comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the\npage.

So...\n\n                    VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)\n          That's fair. I'll let her know.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          Tell Susan I'd be very happy to meet her\n          at a future date.

It's\nstill smiling, but not at him. It's not glowing. Maybe it's\neven smirking. Kaufman paces frantically, holding his\nstomach. Donald's off-screen typing grows louder.\n\nINT.

But let me tell\n          you, you don't know what writing is!\n\nKaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over.\n\nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY\n\nKaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an IV. He watches a\nslightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a\nsmall room across the hall. She glances over in his\ndirection. He smiles. She looks through him.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          She thinks I'm repulsive.\n\nHe lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up.\n\nINT.

I'll send it to you.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          This is more honest than anything\n          anyone's ever done before in a movie,\n          I'll tell you that. The only truth we\n          can offer is the truth that's our own\n          experience of the world. \"The great\n          poet, in writing himself, writes his\n          time.\" T.S.

So we walked.

I never thought many people in\n          the world were like John, but I was\n          realizing more and more that Laroche was\n          an extreme, not an aberration -- most\n          people in some way or another do strive\n          for something exceptional, something to\n          pursue, even at their peril, rather than\n          abide an ordinary life.\n\nEXT. MIDTOWN NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY\n\nKaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along. He arrives at the\nNew Yorker building and enters with steely determination.\n\nINT. BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nKaufman waits for the elevator, sweating even more profusely.\nThe elevator doors open. People get off, people get on, the\nelevator doors close. Kaufman still stands there.\n\nEXT. SWAMP - MORNING\n\nLaroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They\nsink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to\npull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the\nwater. Something big runs by in the distance. Bees, and\ndragonflies hover. Gnats and mosquitoes bite. Birds\nscreech. Frogs croak. Laroche points to a yellow flower.\n\n                    LAROCHE\n          Here we go. Encyclia tempensis.\n\nLaroche lights a cigarette.\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             80.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    LAROCHE (cont'd)\n          Nice little sucker, isn't it?\n\nOrlean examines it from a distance.\n\n                      ORLEAN\n          Cute.\n\nLaroche continues walking and Orlean attempts to keep pace.\nHe points at a tiny orchid on another tree.\n\n                    LAROCHE\n          Clamshell orchid. You know that.\n\n                      ORLEAN\n          Uh-huh.\n\n                    LAROCHE\n          See, I found you two already. I'll show\n          you every orchid you want today. I'll\n          find you a fucking ghost if it kills me.\n              (pointing to another orchid)\n          Rigid Epidendrum. That's an ugly-ass\n          orchid. But I'm no snob. I'm interested\n          in all orchids. Not just pretty ones.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nA miserable Kaufman sits in the window, sipping coffee and\nwatching the New Yorker building across the street. He\nsteels himself, exits the coffee shop.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nKaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. It stops a few\ntimes; people get off and on. Kaufman sweats. The doors\nopen. The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite\nthe elevator. Nobody gets off or on. The doors close. The\nelevator continues up. Kaufman hates himself. Soon the\nelevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It\nbegins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker.\nThis time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked.\nOrlean looks at him blankly, presses \"lobby\", and faces\nfront. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The\nelevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out. Kaufman\nhesitates, then follows.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY\n\nOrlean walks along.   Kaufman follows her.\n\n                                                              81.\n\n\n\nEXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING\n\nThe sun is much higher in the sky. Orlean is a sweaty mess,\nfrizzed hair, anxious, scraped, dirty.\n\n                    LAROCHE\n              (peppy)\n          They're right nearby.    Just follow me.\n\nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY\n\nOrlean sits by herself, reading Vanity Fair. Kaufman sits a\nfew tables away. He scribbles in his notebook.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          Reads Vanity Fair. Funny detail: New\n          Yorker writer reads Vanity Fair. Use!\n\nA waitress brings a tuna sandwich and an ice tea to Orlean.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)\n          Likes tuna, drinks ice tea. Good\n          character details. Good stuff!\n\nOrlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress.\n\n                     ORLEAN\n          Thanks.   Could I get some lemon please?\n\nThe waitress nods and leaves.   Kaufman scribbles.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not\n          at all what I imagined. Interesting!\n\nEXT. SWAMP - NOON\n\nOrlean follows Laroche. She watches him start off in one\ndirection, stop, start off another direction, then go\nstraight ahead. Orlean seems depressed.\n\n                    ORLEAN\n          Laroche, can I ask you a personal\n          question?\n\nLaroche turns and scowls at her.\n\n                    LAROCHE\n          We're not lost.\n\nEXT. NYC STREET - DAY\n\nOrlean window shops at a shoe store.   Kaufman takes notes.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               82.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n             Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps.    Okay.\n\nOrlean heads down the street. Kaufman follows. She enters\nthe New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside.\n\nEXT. SWAMP - DAY\n\nThe sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She\nwatches him march forward with great authority. She massages\nher eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face.\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nKaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed.\n\n                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n             I have nothing. I am nothing.     I am fat.\n             I am over. I am lost.\n\nEXT. SWAMP    - LATER\n\nThe sun is high. Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground. She\nstares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself\nopening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche\nspeaks without looking up.\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             We're not lost.\n\nLaroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             I'm just turned around a little.\n\nHe looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around\non the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a\n             few minutes, and we'll be able to tell\n             which way the sun is moving. We want to\n             be heading southeast.\n\nLaroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.\n\n                        LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             This is no big deal. You should eat\n             something.\n\nOrlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches\nhis legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean,\nhe puts the twig back.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            83.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             So do you collect anything?\n\n                       ORLEAN\n                 (non-responsive)\n             Not really.\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             Well, y'know it's not really about\n             collecting the thing, it's about --\n\n                       ORLEAN\n             The sundial isn't working.\n\nLaroche looks down at it.\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             It is so working.\n\nOrlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at\nLaroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and\npanic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.\nHer eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her\nbrain. Laroche seems unaware.\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             The thing about computers. The thing I\n             like is that I'm immersed in it but it's\n             not a living thing that's going to leave\n             or die or something. I prefer having the\n             minimum number of living things to worry\n             about in my life.\n\nOrlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche.\n\n                       ORLEAN\n             So, John...\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go\n             straight and eventually we'll get there.\n\nThey rise.\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n             What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out\n             of here. I mean, logically, we have to\n             get out as long as we walk straight.\n\nLaroche points them in a direction and they walk.\n\n                                                             84.\n\n\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING\n\nKaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night.\nThe phone rings. He reaches for it.\n\n                        KAUFMAN\n          Hello?\n\n                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)\n          Hey, it's Jerry. I woke you?\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          No, it's okay.\n\n                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)\n          How's it going? Has it been helpful to\n          talk to the writer? What's her name?\n\n                      KAUFMAN\n          Yeah.    Susan Orlean.\n\n                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)\n          Well, I mean, are you making headway?\n          Valerie's breathing down my neck.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          You can't rush inspiration.

Good.\n\n                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)\n          I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

He eyes other sad-looking, balding,\noverweight men wandering the streets also.\n\n                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n             I am fat. I can't write. I am\n             repulsive. I am old. I have\n             accomplished nothing. I am just one more\n             old, fat, bald man on the street.\n\nEXT. SWAMP - DAY\n\nLaroche leads the way. There's a sadness, a sense of defeat\nand humiliation that he tries to conceal. Orlean is stony.\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             I've done this a million times. Whenever\n             everything's killing me, I just say to\n             myself, screw it, and go straight ahead.\n\nLaroche leads Orlean back into the brush.\n\nEXT. NYC STREET - MORNING\n\nKaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the\nsun. He walks toward it.\n\nINT. LOBBY - MORNING\n\nThe lobby of an auditorium, crowded with enthusiastic people\nsigning up for something. Kaufman waits in line.    He\nwatches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an\nattractive female registrar. The guy moves on and the\nattractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman.\n\n                       REGISTRAR\n             May I help you?\n\nKaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze; they come to rest\non a pile of McKee's book Story next to her.\n\n                                                            86.\n\n\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER\n\nKaufman sits in the packed room.   McKee paces the stage with\na mic clipped to his lapel.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          Years from now you'll be standing around\n          a posh cocktail party congratulating\n          yourself on how you spent an entire\n          weekend locked in a room with an asshole,\n          an opinionated arrogant asshole, for your\n          art.\n\nThe audience laughs, except for Kaufman who looks pained.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          I am pathetic. I am a loser.    I am fat.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          So... what is the substance of writing?\n          Nothing as trivial as words is at the\n          heart of this great art, my friends.\n\nMcKee continues to talk but his voice goes under.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          I have failed. I am panicked. I am fat.\n          I have sold out. I am worthless. I...\n\n                    MCKEE\n          Literary talent is not enough. First,\n          last, and always, the imperative is to\n          tell a story.\n\nKaufman watches with disdain as people take notes.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle\n          said, when storytelling goes bad in a\n          society, the result is decadence.\n              (deadpan)\n          Well, just look around you.\n\nEveryone, except Kaufman, laughs giddily at McKee's joke.\n\n                    MCKEE (cont'd)\n          Aristotle also said: A story must have a\n          beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nThe students nod in appreciation at this profundity.\n\n                                                            87.\n\n\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\nMcKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead\nprojector. It's some kind of complicated time-line with act-\nbreaks and corresponding page numbers indicated. The\naudience members take copious notes. Kaufman sweats.\n\n                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)\n          It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of\n          conviction that brings me here with all\n          these desperate idiots lapping up\n          everything this bag of wind spouts. Easy\n          answers. Rules to short-cut yourself to\n          success. And here I am, because my jaunt\n          into the abyss brought me nothing. Well,\n          isn't that the risk one takes for\n          attempting something new. I should leave\n          here right now. I'll start over --\n              (starts to rise)\n          I need to face this project head on and --\n\n                    MCKEE\n          ... and God help you if you use voice-\n          over in your work, my friends.\n\nKaufman stops, looks up, startled.    McKee seems to be looking\nat him.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          God fucking help you! It's flaccid,\n          sloppy writing. Any idiot can write\n          voice-over narration to explain the\n          thoughts of a character. You must\n          present the internal conflicts of your\n          character in image, in symbol. Film is a\n          medium of movement and image.\n\nKaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. \"Any\nidiot...\" writes the guy on one side of him. \"Flaccid...\"\nwrites the guy on the other side.\n\n                    MCKEE (cont'd)\n          Okay, one hour for lunch.\n\nEXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nStudents exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman\nwanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound.\n\n                                                           88.\n\n\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\nMcKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of\nAristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a\nbust of Aristotle on the cover.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          You want your writing to be original.\n          You want to have an original voice like\n          Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me\n          tell you something, my friends. The key\n          to originality is not eccentricity.\n\nA guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative \"mmmm.\"\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\nIt's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now\nKaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears\nhis sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly\nplanted on his face as he talks and talks.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          Long speechs are antithetical to the\n          nature of cinema. The Greeks called it\n          stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of\n          ideas. A long speech in a script, say a\n          page long, requires that the camera hold\n          on the actor's face for a minute. Look\n          at the second hand on your watch as it\n          makes one complete rotation around the\n          clock face and you'll get an idea of how\n          intolerable that would be for an\n          audience. The ontology of the screen is\n          that it's always now and it's always\n          action and it's always vivid. Life is\n          rarely vivid. And that's an important\n          point.

I wanted to present it\n          simply, without big character arcs or\n          sensationalizing the story. I wanted to\n          show flowers as God's miracles.   I\n          wanted to show that Orlean never saw the\n          blooming ghost orchid. It's about\n          disappointment.\n\n                    MCKEE\n          I see. That's not a movie.

Orlean gets in, the van speeds off.\nAnother car pulls away from the curb and follows it.\n\nINT. CAR - A BIT LATER\n\nDonald drives, keeping up with the van, which speeds and\nswerves through traffic.

SUBURBAN STREET - LATER\n\nThe van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class\nhouse. Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean\nand Laroche emerge from the van. Orlean seems different now:\nmore exotic. She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. Donald\ndrives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches\nas Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house.\n\n                    DONALD\n          I'll get a closer look.

This creates a\n          shitload of mucus in the windpipe.\n          Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a\n          sticky foam which may or may not mix with\n          vomit. It's the presence of this white\n          foam that indicates drowning. There's a\n          lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints,\n          hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks.\n          They all tell a tale to today's forensic\n          scientists.\n              (to Kaufman)\n          What do you think? You're a writer. How\n          would you do it?

Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a\nsecond Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil.\nDonald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road.\n\nLaroche pulls himself from the water.\n\n                       LAROCHE (cont'd)\n          Fuck!\n\n                       ORLEAN\n                 (receptively)\n             Yeah, let's, baby.\n\nShe staggers moonily toward Laroche.      He pushes her away.\n\n                       LAROCHE\n             Not now. We got to kill that guy. And\n             now I guess that other guy as well.\n\n                       ORLEAN\n                 (disappointed)\n             Ohhh.\n\n                                                            107.\n\n\n\nINT.

I couldn't move.\n\nLaroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          Shit!\n\nIt rams them again, this time sending them down into the\nswamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the\nroad; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van.\n\n                    DONALD\n          We've gotta ditch this thing.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n              (hysterical)\n          It's a rental!

Walk with us\n          and I'll be sure you avoid all the\n          pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards\n          and backwards. There's alligators and\n          poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs.\n\nKaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water.\nNowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers\nrun along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops.\n\n                     DONALD\n          Wait.   Do you hear something?\n\nKaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          Donald, that sounds bad.\n\nThe brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping\ngets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the\nshore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark\nfor bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and\nOrlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the\nengine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the\npigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman\nkicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick\nconnects and the pig flies into the water.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           109.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\nLaroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It\nnicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a\ncypress stand.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          Watch out, watch out, watch out!\n\nDonald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have\nbeen left far behind. Donald slows the boat.\n\n                    DONALD\n          I think we're okay.\n\nSuddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and\nspeeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at\nthe boat from the van window.\n\n                      DONALD (cont'd)\n          Hold on!\n\nDonald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues.\nBullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet\nhits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame,\nilluminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown,\nalong with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water,\nlooks all around for Kaufman.\n\n                      DONALD (cont'd)\n          Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you?\n\nUnderwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The\nmurky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the\nsurface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces.\n\nOn the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water,\nthen get jerked back down. Donald dives.\n\nUnderwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the\nleg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken\npropeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs\nKaufman, and brings him to the surface.\n\nDonald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is\nfired. It skims the water near Kaufman.\n\n                     KAUFMAN\n          Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead.\n\n                    DONALD\n          We're okay.

My back is fine.\n\nLaroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting.\n\nMike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck\nand agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames.\n\nDonald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping\nKaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n          Donald!\n\nKaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and\nmangled.

Okay?\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n          Okay.\n\nDonald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears\nout of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his\nbrother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van\nfollows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 111.\nCONTINUED: (4)\n\nSmoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out\nof the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They\nfollow Kaufman into the swamp.\n\nMike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out,\nsurveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.\n\n                    MIKE OWEN\n          Jesus, that writer guy.\n\nOwen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken.\nHe lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.\n\nKaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean\nfollow the sound of his sloshing.\n\n                    ORLEAN\n          Water sounds so sparkly.

Up ahead, Kaufman limps out\nof the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused.\nHe checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and\nskids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps\nover to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          You gotta help me.    You gotta help me.\n\n                    MIKE OWEN\n          What the hell is going on here?\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          They're after me.

The cop waits sympathetically, then:\n\n                    POLICE OFFICER\n          You two really look alike.\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n              (proudly)\n          Yeah. Yes, we do.\n\nINT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY\n\nKaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad.\nHe's a little scraped-up, a little tougher. A copy of Story\nby McKee is among his reference material. Alice, the\nwaitress, walks by and glances at the table.\n\n                    ALICE\n          Oh, I love McKee!\n              (recognizes Kaufman, gets\n               reserved)\n          Oh, hi. Haven't seen you in a while.\n\n                      KAUFMAN\n          Hi.    Yeah, I've been away.\n\n                    ALICE\n          So you studying screenwriting?\n\n                    KAUFMAN\n          I'm actually finishing one up.\n\n                    ALICE\n          Good for you! Me too. God, it's so hard\n          to get in, huh? Everyone and their\n          brother is writing a screenplay.\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n             Yeah. Actually I'm writing this one for\n             Sony Pictures.\n\n                        ALICE\n             Really? Wow. Really?   That's so cool.\n                 (beat)\n                        (MORE)\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           116.\nCONTINUED:\n                       ALICE (cont'd)\n             Wow! So what's it about, if you don't\n             mind my asking?\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n             That's tough. Let's see... about being\n             yourself, maybe. It's about learning\n             that if you can't love yourself, you\n             can't really love anyone.\n\n                       ALICE\n             That's true. God, that's so true.     It's\n             such an important message, y'know?\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n             See, my twin brother was murdered\n             recently --\n\n                         ALICE\n             Oh God!    I'm sorry.   That's so horrible.\n\n                      KAUFMAN\n             Thanks. Like part of me ripped away.\n             Forever. It was a wake up call.\n\n                       ALICE\n             I'm so sorry. You poor man.\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n             Anyway, it helped put things in\n             perspective. Life is a miracle. All\n             life, from the flower to the human being.\n             You. Me. And I want to show people\n             that. For my brother. For everyone.\n\nThere's a pause.       Alice just stares at him, in awe.\n\n                       ALICE\n             Listen, do you mind if I sit for a sec?\n\n                       KAUFMAN\n             But you're working.\n\n                       ALICE\n                 (shrugs)\n             It's a stupid job, y'know.    I'm Alice.\n\n                         KAUFMAN\n             Charlie.\n\n                       ALICE\n             I like that name. Charlie. I've always\n             really liked that name. Charlie.\n\nAlice smiles, sits.      The two of them begin to talk.\n\n                                                         117.\n\n\n\nEXT.
