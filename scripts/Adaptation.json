I never thought many people in\n          the world were like John, but I was\n          realizing more and more that Laroche was\n          an extreme, not an aberration -- most\n          people in some way or another do strive\n          for something exceptional, something to\n          pursue, even at their peril, rather than\n          abide an ordinary life.\n\n<b>EXT.

Soon the\nelevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It\nbegins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker.\nThis time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked.\nOrlean looks at him blankly, presses \"lobby\", and faces\nfront. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The\nelevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out.

Any idiot can write\n          voice-over narration to explain the\n          thoughts of a character. You must\n          present the internal conflicts of your\n          character in image, in symbol.

We stay firmly\nplanted on his face as he talks and talks.\n\n<b>                    MCKEE\n</b>          Long speechs are antithetical to the\n          nature of cinema. The Greeks called it\n          stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of\n          ideas. A long speech in a script, say a\n          page long, requires that the camera hold\n          on the actor's face for a minute. Look\n          at the second hand on your watch as it\n          makes one complete rotation around the\n          clock face and you'll get an idea of how\n          intolerable that would be for an\n          audience. The ontology of the screen is\n          that it's always now and it's always\n          action and it's always vivid. Life is\n          rarely vivid. And that's an important\n          point. We are not recreating life on the\n          screen. Writers are not tape recorders.\n          Have you ever eavesdropped on people\n          talking in a coffee shop? Then you know\n          how dull and tedious real conversation\n          is. Real people are not interesting.\n          There's not a person in this world -- and\n          I include myself in this -- who would be\n          interesting enough to take as is and put\n          in a movie as a character.\n\n<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             89.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>INT.

Laroche and Orlean\nfollow the sound of his sloshing.\n\n<b>                    ORLEAN\n</b>          Water sounds so sparkly.

Owen is confused.\nHe checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and\nskids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps\nover to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.\n\n<b>                    KAUFMAN\n</b>          You gotta help me.
