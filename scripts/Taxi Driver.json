On\nthe surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a\nquiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from\nnowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,\naround his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the\nominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness\nand loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land\nwhere it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants\nseldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but\nthe eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.\n\nTravis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night\nlife, a dark shadow among darker shadows.  Not noticed, no\nreason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings.\nHe wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt\nand a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, \"King\nKong Company 1968-70\".\n\nHe has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,\nlonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,\ndriving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one\nlooks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot\nbe wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the\nsun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence.\n\nFILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE.  Weather-beaten\nsign above driveway reads, \"Taxi Enter Here\". Yellow cabs\nscuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the\ncurbs, the wind is howling.\n\nINSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.\nEchoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy\nbreath and exhaust fill the air.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR of cab company offices. Lettering on ajar door\nreads:\n\n<b>                       PERSONAL OFFICE\n</b>\n                     Marvis Cab Company\n                   Blue and White Cab Co.\n                          Acme Taxi\n                  Dependable Taxi Services\n                       JRB Cab Company\n                     Speedo Taxi Service\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                            2.\n</b>\n\nSOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.\n\nPERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading\n\"Marvis, B&amp;W, Acme\" and so forth are tacked to crumbling\nplaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms,\nreports and an old upright Royal typewriter.\n\nDishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We\nCUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged\nPERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his\ndesk.\n\nThe young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots\nand Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.\n\nThe PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at\nwork exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense\nsteely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out\nof his workaday boredom.\n\n<b>                         PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)\n</b>            No trouble with the Hack Bureau?\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS (O.S.)\n</b>            No Sir.\n\n<b>                         PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)\n</b>            Got your license?\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS (O.S.)\n</b>            Yes.\n\n<b>                         PERSONNEL OFFICER\n</b>            So why do you want to be a taxi\n            driver?\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>            I can't sleep nights.\n\n<b>                         PERSONNEL OFFICER\n</b>            There's porno theatres for that.\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>            I know.

The\nhigh-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows\nare shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the\npoor and common is also falling on them.\n\nThe unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against\nthe dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and\ngreen lights reflects off the pavements and autos.\n\n\"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver\" -\nso goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular\nnight's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the\nsituation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and\ntraffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.\n\nFurther uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so\nglittering.  The rain also falls on the street bums and aged\npoor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,\nhookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service\nthem too.\n\nAll through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if\ncoming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.\nThe listener is at a safe but privileged distance.\n\nAfter examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife,\nCAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is\nassumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.\n\n<b>END CREDITS\n</b>\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\nTravis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground.

The pornography is of the sort that\nlooks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos\nof naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and\nclothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety\nchair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright\nmelon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like\na Vietnamese flag.

TRAVIS'\npresence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star\nqualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something\nspecial about the young man who stands before her. And then,\ntoo, there is that disarming smile.

Get those old coots off\n            welfare and make 'em work for a\n            change.\n\nBetsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly\nPalantine's position on welfare.

His\nmanner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was\ndoing.\n\nBetsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and\nsays:\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>            I'm just going to find out what the\n            cabbies are thinking.\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\nTravis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the\nPalantine Headquarters.

They both have been served coffee; Travis is\nnervously turning his cup around in his hands.\n\nAs Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple\npie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS (V.O.)\n</b>            I had black coffee and apple pie\n            with a slice of melted yellow\n            cheese.  I think that was a good\n            selection. Betsy had coffee and a\n            fruit salad dish. She could have\n            had anything she wanted.\n\nBetsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.:\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           30.\n</b>\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>            We've signed up 15.000 Palantine\n            volunteers in New York so far.

The very\nsight of it makes one's heart proud.\n\nBetsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis'\ncontagious, quicksilver moods cause:\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>                   (laughing)\n            Travis, I never ever met anybody\n            like you before.\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>            I can believe that.\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>            Where do you live?\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>                   (evasive)\n            Oh, uptown.

He watches the stylish, attractive\nfemale help, unable to come right out and requests what he\ndesires.\n\nA young SALESGIRL sees his plight, walks over and asks if he\nneeds any help. Travis INAUDIBLY says a name to her, although\nthe name is obviously Kris Kristofferson.\n\nThe Salesgirl digs out Kristofferson's \"Silver-Tongued\nDevil\" album for him.\n\nTravis says something additional to the Salesgirl and she\ngoes off to gift-wrap the album.\n\nTravis emerges from the RECORD STORE, the brightly gift-\nwrapped album proudly tucked under his arm.\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\nA lengthy POV SHOT from Travis' vantage point behind the\nwheel.\n\nWe see the city as Travis sees it. The front windshield is a\nlittle dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right\nscreen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.\n\nThe light turns green; we take off with a start. A short\nfirst gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases\nto the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.\n\nOur eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular -\nbums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -\nthey mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks\nand lighted storefronts.\n\nOur eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the\ncurb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           36.\n</b>\n\nIn the next block there are perhaps three, four fares -\nquick gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply -\ncheck the action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let\nthe next guy pick them up. Let the second go also, the\nthird - there's a live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short\nfare to the East Side, good tip.\n\nWe pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long\nwait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We\nfocus on (as Travis would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the\ndistance.\n\nAs we travel, we hear Travis' random thoughts about selecting\nfares and tips:\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS (V.O.)\n</b>            You work at night, you get an\n            instinct. You can smell them. The\n            big tippers, the stiffs, the\n            trouble makers. Quarter is good tip\n            for Manhattan. Queens is better,\n            Brooklyn is best. go for the guys\n            with suitcases. The rich are the\n            worst tippers, hooks are lousy.\n            Spooks are okay, but they don't\n            live at Park Ave after all.\n\nThe meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A\nquick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,\n\"192 East 89\".  We take off with another jolt. Cross back up\n9th Ave, then cut through the park.\n\nWe're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we\nstring together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but\nquickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a\n$1.40 fare.\n\nNow through the park and we're almost there. Check the\nnumbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.\n\nCheck back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters\nand a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.\n\nThe tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take\noff again with a jolt.\n\nThis is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring\nmain streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen\ninstantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are\nthese objects?\n\nEXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street.\n\nTravis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           37.\n</b>\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS (V.O.)\n</b>            I called Betsy again at her office,\n            and she said maybe we could go to a\n            movie together after she gets off\n            work tomorrow.

I forgot to ask\n            her last name again.  Damn. I've\n            got to remember stuff like that.\n\nTravis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis'\ncab. He activates the meter and pulls off.\n\n<b>                         MAN'S VOICE\n</b>            St. Regis Hotel.\n\nTravis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he\nrecognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE,\ncandidate for President.

Maybe she was wrong to go out\nwith this fellow she doesn't know.\n\nShe makes a polite laugh.\n\nLATER.  Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the\ncorner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the\nalbum under his arm.\n\nThey approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno\ntheatre advertising \"The Swedish Marriage Manual\". The box\noffice is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with\nexplicit publicity stills.  Offending portions have been\nblocked out with black tape.\n\nTravis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.\nBetsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.\nTravis returns with the tickets.\n\nBetsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening:\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>            What are you doing?\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>                   (innocent)\n            I bought a couple of tickets.\n\n<b>                         BETSY\n</b>            But this is a porno movie.\n\n<b>                         TRAVIS\n</b>            No, these are the kind that couples\n            go to.

He is so much part of his own world,\nhe fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the\nmovies he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also\nsomething that Travis could not even acknowledge, much less\nadmit: That he really wants to get this pure white girl into\nthat dark porno theatre.\n\nTravis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the\ntheatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at\nTravis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the\nturnstile. She thinks to herself: \"What the Hell. What can\nhappen?\" She's always been curious about these pictures\nanyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -\nshe's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic\nwhich applies even more in offsetting circumstances like\nthese.\n\n<b>INSIDE THE THEATER\n</b>\nTravis escorts Betsy to an empty center row. Travis was\nright. Couples do go to films like this. There are at least\nsix or seven other MEN with their bewigged \"DATES\".\n\nTravis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy\nlooks curiously from side to side.\n\nON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is\nspeaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in\na happy marriage.  Subtitles translate her words. Then,\nwithout warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating\non a sterile table-like bed.\n\nTravis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly\ndraining from Betsy's cheeks.

The walls are heavily\nsoundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor.\n\nTravis stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm's\nlength.  With each blasting discharge from the Magnum,\nTravis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil\nfrom the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity.\n\nTravis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim\nand re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up\nthe .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim.\nAfter the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a\ncontest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After\nall the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them\nwithout a moment's hesitation.\n\nDownrange, the red and white targets have the black outline\nof a human figure drawn over them. The contour-man convulses\nunder the steady barrage of Travis' rapid-fire shots.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           57.\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.

The .44\nMagnum rests on his lap.\n\nThe TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local\nteenage dance and rock show.  On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPERS\nare dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the\ngenre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm young\nbreasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which reflects\nTRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the most\nunabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has\nyet developed.\n\nThe HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the\nlocal DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35.\nFIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on his\nshoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish\nawe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc\njockey blather. He is the complete asshole; I don't know who\nis currently performing this function in New York, but in\nLos Angeles his name is Real Don Steele.\n\n<b>                         TV DISC JOCKEY\n</b>            Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out\n            dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on\n            it. You got it, flaunt it.\n\nTRAVIS watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. He is,\nas the Scriptures would say, pondering all these things in\nhis heart. Why is it the assholes get all the beautiful\nyoung chicks? He takes a swig of peach brandy.\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\nEARLY EVENING, about 6:30 p.m.  TRAVIS' taxi, with 'Off\nDuty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown\nManhattan.\n\nTRAVIS runs his hand down the left side of his jacket,\nattempting to smooth out the bulge underneath.\n\nTRAVIS opens his jacket partially, checking underneath.\nThere rests the nickel-plated .38 Special in its holster.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           58.\n</b>\n\nP.O.V. down the street where TRAVIS' taxi is parked: Several\nblocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters\nof CHARLES PALANTINE are visible.\n\nTRAVIS' eyes resume their watch.\n\nTRAVIS starts the car and drives toward the PALANTINE\n<b>HEADQUARTERS.\n</b>\nTRACKING P.O.V. shot of row of storefronts leading up to\nPalantine Headquarters.

TRAVIS is on the LOWER EAST\nSIDE, somewhere on B Street, east of Tompkins Square.\n\nThe sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once\nwas the hippie movement: TEENAGE STREET-WALKERS, JUNKIES,\nTHUGS, emaciated LONERS on the prowl.\n\nTRAVIS' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare.\n\nTRAVIS pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't\nslam -- instead there is the SOUND of another person jumping\ninto the cab.\n\nTRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there\nsits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE.\n\nThe GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made\nup to look older.

His hands are in his jacket pockets,\nobscuring the slight bulge on his left side.\n\nTRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER.  He\nreaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and\npulls out crumpled $20 bill.  Seeing the $20 bill, he\ndecides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet\ninstead.\n\nTRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened\ntheater auditorium.

As the CAMERA MOVES along it\ndiscovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut-\nup sections of city maps with notations written in.  There\nis lengthy N.Y.

He is wearing\nthe empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand.\n\nIn the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson\nin gunmanship:\n\nTRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his\nholster and firing it.\n\nHe hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices\nwithdrawing it.  He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length,\ntightening his forearm muscles.\n\nHe has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his\ninner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind\nthe upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated,\nsending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm.

Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the\nloudspeaker system.\n\nThe CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive\nmetallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques,\nstands out in the CROWD.\n\nOn the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS\nas well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS.\n\nTOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY\nstands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER.\n\nTOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to\nwhat he was reading.

There he is: brush-\ncut, wearing a giant grin, and a large \"Palantine '72\" button.\n\nAlthough it is a pleasant sunny day, TRAVIS wears a bulky\nbulged-out Army jacket.\n\nTRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the\n<b>CROWD.\n</b>\nA SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS walks up to a SECRET SERVICE MAN\nstanding near the fringes of the CROWD.

TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts\nacross toward Tompkins Square.\n\nTRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the\nbrakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth.\n\nHe has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the\nstreet.  She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her\nbalance and stares in shock through the front window.  C.U.\nGIRL's face.\n\nTRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi\na week or so before.  IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then\nturns and continues walking.\n\nTRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND.  They\nare both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots,\njeans, floppy hats.  And the old come-hither walk is\nunmistakable.\n\nTRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk\ndown the sidewalk.\n\nTRAVIS' P.O.V.  He examines them from bottom to top --\nboots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats.\n\nAs TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar\nFRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows.  The GIRLS\nlook toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some\nunheard comment, and continue on.\n\nIRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on.\n\nOn the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat\nout of place in this environment, but making every attempt\nto groove on it.  They are high on something or another.\n\nThe GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them.\nThey exchange some small talk and walk off together.  There\nis little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.\n\nTRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to\ncontinue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS.\nThis is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.\n\nAs TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER\nHIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and\nher GIRLFRIEND.  She walks over to the taxi, loans in the\nopen left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised\nas an innocent question:\n\n<b>C.U.

You comin' or goin'?\n\nTRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination\nof shock, embarrassment and revulsion.  He is the child\ncaught with his hand in the cookie jar.  The very presence\nof this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and\nsickens him.\n\nTRAVIS takes off with a skreetch.  His taxi shoots down the\nblock.\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\nA HOT JUNE DAY.  TRAVIS' taxi, the \"Off Duty\" sign on, is\nparked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM.  WHITE COPS,\nSECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise\nBLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g.\n\nCHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant\nloudspeaker system.  It is a political rally.\n\nTRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in\nthe distance.  His hair, of course, is still clipped short\nand he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses.  Even though a\ndrop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS\nwears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the\n.38 Smith and Wesson bulge.\n\nA BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his\nuptown campaign headquarters.  On the platform sit an array\nof BLACK DIGNITARIES.  Nearby we recognize the SECRET\nSERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans\nthe CROWD anxiously.\n\nPALANTINE is speaking animatedly.  He is an excellent\nspeaker and captures our attention.  He drives hard toward\nhis arguments, crashes down on his points.  His strained\nvoice rings with sincerity and anger.\n\nC.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks.

Now is the time for\n            one man to stand up and accept his\n            neighbor, for one man to give in\n            order that all might receive.

He is\nreading from a letter or card he has just written.\n\nAs he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated\nrow of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked\nCHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and\nso forth.

A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at\nthe head of the mattress.\n\nAUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle-\naged uneducated man reading in voice over.\n\nIt is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter\nhe sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall.\n\n<b>                         IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)\n</b>            Dear Mr. Bickle,\n\n            I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma\n            and I were to hear that you are\n            well and recuperating.  We tried to\n            visit you at the hospital when we\n            were in New York to pick up Iris,\n            but you were still in a coma.\n\n            There is no way we can repay you\n            for returning our Iris to us.  We\n            thought we had lost her, but now\n            our lives are full again.  Needless\n            to say, you are something of a hero\n            around this household.\n\n            I'm sure you want to know about\n            Iris.  She is back in school and\n            working hard.  The transition has\n            been very hard for her, as you can\n            well imagine, but we have taken\n            steps to see she never has cause to\n            run away again.\n\n            In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I\n            would like to again thank you from\n            the bottom of our hearts.\n            Unfortunately, we cannot afford to\n            come to New York again to thank you\n            in person, or we surely would.  But\n            if you should ever come to\n            Pittsburgh, you would find yourself\n            a most welcome guest in our home.\n\n            Our deepest thanks,\n\n            Burt and Ivy Steensma\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.
