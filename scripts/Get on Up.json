Generally speaking, when\r\n              you receive care from a\r\n              participating PDP dentist, your out-\r\n              of-pocket expenses will typically\r\n              be lower than if your were to\r\n              accept care from a dentist outside\r\n              the group. The law deems it illegal\r\n              for dentists to charge any more\r\n              than the network approves... But\r\n              listen, in my three and a half\r\n              years of experience in this\r\n              business people mainly care about\r\n              keeping their premiums low.

So. How does the program work?\r\n          Initially, participating dentists\r\n          undergo an extensive credentialing\r\n          process which, if approved, allows\r\n          customers to pay the minimum\r\n          deductible allowed and the\r\n          remainder is insured. But with non-\r\n          participating dentists the cost per\r\n          visit is much higher and comes\r\n          completely out of pocket. So some\r\n          people may want a high deductible\r\n          because they have more to cover,\r\n          but most common folks simply want\r\n          the lowest possible plan... and\r\n          remember our key takeaway!?\r\n\r\nEntire seminar in UNISON.\r\n\r\n          We must accommodate the specific condition of-\r\n\r\n\r\nThe office door flies open.
