This is my\n          neighborhood. This is my street. This...\n          is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In\n          less than a year, I'll be dead.\n\nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nWe're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:\n\nLESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,\nface down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.\nLester gropes blindly to shut it off.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          Of course, I don't know that yet. He\n          rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He\n          doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect\n          of a new day.\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              2.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)

BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER\n\nLester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.\n\nANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is\nsilhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes\napparent he is masturbating.\n\n                     LESTER (V.O.)\n              (amused)\n          Look at me, jerking off in the shower.\n              (then)\n          This will be the high point of my day.\n          It's all downhill from here.\n\nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\n\nCLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand\nwith CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.\n\nCAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham\nhouse. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears\ncolor-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and\nexpensive tools.\n\nLester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,\npeeping out through the drapes.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the\n          handle on those pruning shears matches\n          her gardening clogs? That's not an\n          accident.\n\nEXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nIn the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS\nrepeatedly.

That color!\n\n                    JIM #1\n          I just love your roses. How do you get\n          them to flourish like this?\n\n                    CAROLYN\n          Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and\n          Miracle Grow.\n\nJim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is\nwatching them.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          Man. I get exhausted just watching her.\n\nLester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,\nbut she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          She wasn't always like this. She used to\n          be happy. We used to be happy.\n\n                                                              4.\n\n\n\nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nJANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          My daughter Jane. Only child.\n\nCLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE\nwindow suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a\nPLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical \"before\" and\n\"after\" photos of surgically augmented breasts.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,\n          insecure, confused. I wish I could tell\n          her that's all going to pass...\n\nOutside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her\nBACKPACK.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          But I don't want to lie to her.\n\nWe HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself\nin a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her\nbreasts.\n\nEXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nCarolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ\nML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the\nHORN again.\n\nJane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her\nshoulder.\n\n                    CAROLYN\n          Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look\n          unattractive?\n\n                    JANE\n          Yes.\n\n                     CAROLYN\n          Well, congratulations. You've succeeded\n          admirably.\n\nJane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,\ncarrying a BRIEFCASE.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             5.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)\n          Lester, could you make me a little later,\n          please? Because I'm not quite late\n          enough.\n\nLester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill\nall over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather\neverything.\n\n                    JANE\n          Nice going, Dad.\n\nLester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.\n\nHis POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also\nbored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          Both my wife and daughter think I'm this\n          gigantic loser, and... they're right.\n\nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER\n\nCarolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is\nasleep in the back seat.\n\n                    LESTER (V.O.)\n          I have lost something. I'm not exactly\n          sure what it is, but I know I didn't\n          always feel this... sedated. But you know\n          what? It's never too late to get it back.\n\nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY\n\nLester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by\nIDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor\nand talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on\nhis face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his\nvoice.\n\n                    LESTER\n          Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media\n          Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.\n          Tamblin, please?...

Yeah. Can I\n          ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does\n          he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to\n          come in...

Lester Burnham. Thank you!\n\nLester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.\n\n                    BRAD\n          Hey Les. You got a minute?\n\nLester turns around, smiling perfunctorily\n\n                    LESTER\n          For you, Brad? I've got five.\n\nINT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER\n\nBrad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.\n\n                    BRAD\n          I'm sure you can understand our need to\n          cut corners around here.\n\nLester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.\n\n                    LESTER\n          Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta\n          free up cash. Gotta spend money to make\n          money. Right?\n\n                    BRAD\n          Exactly.

Calm down. Nobody's getting fired\n          yet. That's why we're having everyone\n          write out a job description, mapping out\n          in detail how they contribute. That way,\n          management can assess who's valuable and--\n\n                    LESTER\n          Who's expendable.\n\n                    BRAD\n          It's just business.\n\n                    LESTER\n              (angry)\n          I've been writing for this magazine for\n          fourteen years, Brad.
