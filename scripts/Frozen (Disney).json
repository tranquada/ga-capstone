Before\r\n   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled.

And it even has a cup\r\n                  holder.... Do you like it?\r\n\r\n                             KRISTOFF\r\n                  Like it?\r\n\r\n   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.\r\n\r\n                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)\r\n                  I love it....

It's a true love's kiss, alright.\r\n\r\n   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.\r\n\r\n   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the\r\n   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.\r\n\r\n   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks\r\n   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.\r\n\r\n   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the\r\n   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it\r\n   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf\r\n   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.\r\n\r\n                                                       CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY\r\n\r\n   The gates to the castle are wide open.

The\r\n   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.\r\n\r\n   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds\r\n   some snow flurries for atmosphere.\r\n\r\n   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.\r\n\r\n                            ANNA\r\n                  I like the open gates.\r\n\r\n                            ELSA\r\n                  We are never closing them again.\r\n\r\n   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally\r\n   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.\r\n\r\n                            ANNA\r\n                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,\r\n                  but you know I don't ska--\r\n\r\n   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna\r\n   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.\r\n\r\n   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.\r\n\r\n                            KRISTOFF\r\n                  Look out.

Glide and pivot and\r\n                  glide and pivot.\r\n\r\n   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye\r\n   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been\r\n   repaired with a ice.\r\n\r\n   All is right in Arendelle.\r\n\r\n                                                   FINAL FADE OUT.\r\n\r\n                                  THE END\r\n\n\n\n\nFrozen (Disney)\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jennifer Lee\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Animation\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:34.714655"}
