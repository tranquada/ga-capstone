We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.\n\n                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n                         No one ever came up to me and said, \n                         'You're a fool. There isn't such a \n                         thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing \n                         you.'\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY\n\n               On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, \n               it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A \n               girl's face breaks through.\n\n                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n                         It wasn't a murder. I think God just \n                         died of old age. And when I realized \n                         He wasn't any more, it didn't shock \n                         me. It seemed natural and right.\n\n               The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like \n               the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She \n               swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then \n               climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.\n\n                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n                         And yet I began to wonder what the \n                         minister meant when he said, 'God, \n                         the Father, sees even the smallest \n                         sparrow fall. He watches over all \n                         his children.' That jumbled it all \n                         up for me.\n\n               EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER\n\n               The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances \n               sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. \n               Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden \n               in the sun.\n\n                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n                         But still sometimes I found that God \n                         was useful to remember, especially \n                         when I lost things that were \n                         important. 'Please God, let me find \n                         my red hat with the blue trimmings.'\n\n               INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING\n\n               Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying \n               back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN \n               FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding \n               from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         It usually worked. God became a \n                         superfather that couldn't spank me. \n                         But if I wanted a thing badly enough, \n                         He arranged it.\n\n               ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening \n               to his daughter read.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         But if God loved all of His children \n                         equally, why did He bother about my \n                         red hat and let other people lose \n                         their fathers and mothers for always?\n\n               Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of \n               her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.\n\n                                     ERNEST\n                         Bye, baby.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         See you next weekend, Dad.\n\n               He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at \n               Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I began to see that He didn't have \n                         much to do about hats or people dying \n                         or anything. They happened whether \n                         He wanted them to or not, and He \n                         stayed in Heaven and pretended not \n                         to notice.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\n               Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit \n               to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium \n               is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner \n               hangs: \"NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931.\"\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I wondered a little why God was such \n                         a useless thing. It seemed a waste \n                         of time to have Him. After that He \n                         became less and less, until He was... \n                         nothingness.\n\n               The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local \n               dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there \n               also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking \n               woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the \n               auditorium, looking a little worried.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I felt rather proud that I had found \n                         the truth myself, without help from \n                         anyone. It puzzled me that other \n                         people hadn't found out, too. God \n                         was gone. We had reached past Him. \n                         Why couldn't they see it? It still \n                         puzzles me.\n\n               Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some \n               response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering \n               of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to \n               her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         You're going straight to hell, Frances \n                         Farmer!\n\n               A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN \n               HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman \n               continues to glare at Frances.\n\n               Frances stares back, dumbfounded.\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY\n\n               The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes \n               with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing \n               the crowd -- which carries placards reading: \"Organize Now!\", \n               \"Workers of the World Unite!\", and \"Elect Kaminski!\" stands \n               MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, \n               stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK.\n\n                                     KAMINSKI\n                         And do you think it's radical for a \n                         man to have a job and feed a family?\n\n                                     YORK & CROWD\n                         No!\n\n                                     KAMINSKI\n                         Is it radical for you to have a hand \n                         in shaping your future, and the future \n                         of your children?\n\n                                     YORK & CROWD\n                         No!\n\n                                     KAMINSKI\n                         Is it radical for the wealth of this \n                         country to be turned back to the \n                         people who built the country?\n\n                                     YORK & CROWD\n                         No!

Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up \n               sign as a banner unfurls: \"Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the \n               World.\"\n\n                                                             FADE TO BLACK:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN: GOD'S IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALL'S RIGHT \n               WITH THE WORLD?

We SEE the SCHOOL \n               SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Seattle is in the news again as a \n                         high school junior wins a national \n                         competition and a hundred dollar \n                         prize with an essay denying God.\n\n               City Hall steps.

Miss Frances Farmer was \n                         unavailable for comment, but her \n                         mother Lillian --\n\n               Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a \n               small CROWD of reporters, photographers, and curious \n               neighbors.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Farmer, a well-known local dietician, \n                         stepped to her daughter's defense.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                              (emphatically)\n                         Frances has not turned her back on \n                         the Lord, they're just having a \n                         momentary difference of opinion. \n                         What child hasn't questioned the \n                         Lord's mysteries in order to better \n                         understand them? To paraphrase Mr. \n                         Voltaire, I may not agree with what \n                         she says, but I'll defend to the \n                         death her right to say it. Freedom \n                         of speech, unlike in the dark \n                         countries to the east, still lives \n                         in America! And in my home.\n\n               Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her \n               father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden \n               from sight.\n\n               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAY\n\n               Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her \n               hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare \n               at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of \n               CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in \n               front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Hi Emma.\n\n               Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Bye Emma.\n\n               Frances shakes her head as she walks on.\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         Hey!\n\n               Frances hesitates, then turns to look:\n\n               A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, \n               Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the \n               union hall and walks toward her.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                              (friendly)\n                         C'mere.

Outside their window we SEE \n               DERELICTS, casualties of the depression, huddled in the night.\n\n               INT. FRANCES' LIMO - NIGHT\n\n               She's staring at the derelicts. We feel her sympathy for \n               them. Almost like she'd rather be out there. A MAN WITH HOLLOW \n               EYES shouts something at them.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         What'd he say?\n\n               She rolls down her window. The Studio Executive beside her \n               looks at her like she's crazy.\n\n                                     STUDIO EXECUTIVE\n                              (to Driver)\n                         Let's go. We'll be late.\n\n               The limousine lurches forward. Frances settles back in her \n               seat, letting the night air sweep over her face.\n\n               EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n               The two limos pull up, the second emptying first. As Frances \n               gets out, the CROWD cheers wildly. She walks past them, eyes \n               glazed. She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons. \n               Lillian is posing and signing autographs. In her tight, formal \n               dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted. As she walks, \n               voices assault her:\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         There she is!\n\n                                     REPORTER #1 (O.S.)\n                         How does it feel to be back in \n                         Seattle, Frances?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         A little strange.\n\n                                     WOMEN'S VOICES\n                         Isn't she gorgeous?\n\n                                     STUDIO EXECUTIVE (O.S.)\n                         This way.\n\n                                     REPORTER #2 (O.S.)\n                         How's the movie, Frances?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         It's okay.\n\n                                     LILLIAN (O.S.)\n                         Smile, little sister, smile.\n\n               Frances sees her mother smiling nervously. They have entered \n               the:\n\n               INT. LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n               Again there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle \n               luminaries are sipping champagne. Reporter #1 lurches forward:\n\n                                     REPORTER #1\n                         Can you make some statement about \n                         Seattle, how the city helped you, or \n                         the schools --\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Well, the truth is the city had \n                         nothing to do with it. I was lucky. \n                         And what wasn't luck was hard work.\n\n                                     REPORTER #1\n                              (disappointed)\n                         Oh.\n\n               Judge Hillier's Wife, whom we recognize as the Woman who \n               shouted at Frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a \n               garish gown. She's holding a large key.\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE\n                         Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how \n                         proud I am to meet you.\n\n               She embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little \n               put off. After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' \n               hand and won't let go. Judge Hillier steps to his wife's \n               side. Lillian also approaches.\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE\n                         On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, \n                         as a token of our vast admiration --\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Excuse me.\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE\n                              (startled)\n                         Yes...?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Don't I know you?\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE\n                         I don't believe so.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Sure. You shouted at me in the \n                         auditorium when I read my essay.\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE\n                         No, my dear. You must be mistaken.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (barely audible)\n                         Oh bullshit.\n\n                                     JUDGE HILLIER\n                         I beg your pardon?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (to the dignitaries)\n                         Listen, I'm still the same girl that \n                         wrote that essay, the same girl who \n                         went to Russia, and you people aren't \n                         proud to meet me at all.\n\n               A hideous silence. Judge Hillier is fuming. His wife is \n               aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of \n               her. She shoves it into Frances' arms.\n\n               Frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio \n               Executive, who escorts her into the theatre. The crowd \n               follows. Lillian is utterly mortified.\n\n               EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n               We TRACK along the side of the theatre. An exit door is thrown \n               open, and Frances storms out. As she does, she trips over an \n               OLD INDIAN BEGGAR. She stops and looks at him. He peers up \n               at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. A \n               connection is made. All the anger drains out of her. She \n               gives him money, several bills. He breaks into a wonderful \n               crooked grin. She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the \n               key to the city. He stares at it, bewildered.\n\n               She strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked \n               with several others at the end of the alley. The CHAUFFEURS \n               are talking and smoking a cigarette. Her chauffeur sees her \n               and hurries to his limo. As it pulls into the street, we see \n               Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT\n\n               Frances sits on the old wood jetty staring out at the water, \n               the lighthouse... Harry approaches.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         ...It's one thing to marry the guy, \n                         but did you have to sleep with him?\n\n               She cracks up. Harry laughs at his mistake.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Shit.

They're \n                         all pretty huffed up about your \n                         leaving.

I mean it could've \n                         been, but they screwed it up, gave \n                         it a happy ending.

THEATRE - AUDIENCE - NIGHT\n\n               TIGHT SHOT on two men: HAROLD CLURMAN -- a thoughtful \n               aristocratic man -- and CLIFFORD ODETS, who is taller, \n               slimmer, with black hair and intense dark eyes. Around them \n               we see (mostly HEAR) the AUDIENCE going crazy, leaping to \n               its feet, yelling \"Bravo! Bravo!\" Clurman and Odets sit \n               impassively. As the hurrahs die down and the audience files \n               out, the two men sit there. Finally Clurman turns to Odets. \n               Odets nods very slightly.\n\n               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Frances sits in the cramped room, listening intently to \n               Clurman. Occasionally she sneaks a glance at Odets, who is \n               pacing like some caged beast.\n\n                                     CLURMAN\n                         The Group is more than a theatre \n                         company.

Our approach allows the actor \n                         to be an artist in the fullest sense, \n                         a creative individual and an \n                         instrument of change.

The point is, \n                         Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful \n                         play.

Everyone's watching her.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (sotto voice)\n                         Get me a drink.\n\n               Barnes nods, concerned, and crosses to the bar.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Hi everybody.\n\n               Some people seem amused, some curious, some scornful. The \n               Director from the mud scene nods to her. Connie is at her \n               side for support. A voice from somewhere pierces the chatter:\n\n                                     SNIDE VOICE\n                         So nice to have you back, Frances.\n\n               As Barnes returns with her drink, she turns to Connie:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Connie, can I use the upstairs \n                         bathroom?\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                         Sure.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Later. Frances lies in a bubblebath, relaxing, sipping her \n               drink. She obviously feels a lot better. Someone knocks.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Come in.\n\n               A FAT MAN ENTERS, stares at her.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (relaxed)\n                         Hi.\n\n               He is dumbfounded.

DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Barnes is talking to a Young Man whom we recognize as the \n               reporter who tricked Frances in New York.\n\n                                     BARNES\n                         You wouldn't believe the offers! \n                         Just piling in.

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               We SEE the open door to the bathroom. Frances, with a towel \n               around her, is going through Connie's closet. Barnes KNOCKS.\n\n                                     BARNES\n                         Frances?\n                              (enters, sees her)\n                         Oh no.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Refill my drink, will you, Bob?\n\n                                     BARNES\n                              (aghast)\n                         What're you doing?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Putting on my armor.\n\n                                     BARNES\n                         Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is \n                         here. She wants to talk to you, help \n                         you out.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (musing)\n                         Louella... didn't she call me a \n                         spoiled little bitch?\n\n                                     BARNES\n                         Come on, she's an important columnist! \n                         What's the matter?

I'll be down \n                         in a minute.\n\n               He nods and retreats out the door.\n\n               INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Everyone chattering away... then hushing slightly. Heads \n               turn: Frances is descending the stairway in one of Connie's \n               dresses. She looks absolutely radiant... like some kind of \n               goddess.\n\n               Barnes, looking very pleased at her appearance and the others' \n               reaction, hands her the drink.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Thank you.\n\n               Then the Young Reporter steps forward.\n\n                                     YOUNG REPORTER\n                              (his callow youth act)\n                         Gee, awful good to see ya again, \n                         Miss Farmer.\n\n               Frances bristles. Barnes looks on nervously: It's all becoming \n               unravelled again.\n\n                                     YOUNG REPORTER\n                         My employer would like to know \n                         something very important: is it true \n                         your friend Clifford sleeps in the \n                         nude?\n\n               Frances is broiling. She stares at him. Under her steady \n               gaze, the snide smile gradually fades from his face.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You seem like an intelligent young \n                         man.\n\n                                     YOUNG REPORTER\n                         Huh?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Can't you find a more dignified way \n                         to make a living?\n\n               He blanches. This hits home. Frances turns on her heel and \n               leaves.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Frances rushes out, followed by Barnes and a few curious \n               partygoers. She is very upset. Tight. Holding it in. Barnes \n               pleads with her, tries to stop her, but she leaps in the car \n               and speeds off, spewing gravel over him. The partygoers salute \n               her with their drinks.\n\n               EXT. A CLIFFSIDE COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT\n\n               In the pale moonlight we SEE the dim outline of a poster \n               tacked to the outside wall. The highway disappears down to \n               the sea glittering dully in the distance. We HEAR the RISING \n               SOUND of an approaching car. Its headlights crest the hill, \n               illuminating the poster, showing a woman driving an open \n               car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure. \n               The poster reads, \"When You're Riding Alone, You're Riding \n               with Hitler.\" The lights grow brighter, almost blinding. The \n               car, accelerating furiously, flashes by. Then we HEAR a \n               motorcycle start up. It emerges from the blackness and speeds \n               off in pursuit. A roadsign reads: \"Dimout Zone.\"\n\n               Frances drives fast, tears running her face.\n\n               The MOTORCYCLE COP pulls up alongside and shouts, \"Pull over!\" \n               She hesitates. He waves insistently. Gradually she slows. He \n               gets off his bike and walks over, preparing the usual lecture.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Okay...\n\n               He leans over the car and sees Frances, her hair wild and \n               tangled.\n\n                                     COP\n                              (a come-on)\n                         Hey, where's the fire, sister?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (sarcastic)\n                         In my eyes, officer.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see \n                         the sign says \"Dimout Zone?\"\n                              (switching off her \n                              lights)\n                         There's a war on, you know?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Come on. You're seriously trying to \n                         tell me the Japs can't find Los \n                         Angeles without my headlights?\n\n                                     COP\n                              (testy)\n                         I didn't make the law, lady. I just \n                         enforce it.\n\n               She switches her headlights back on.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         God, you bore me.\n\n               She starts the car. The Cop, angry now, lunges in and grabs \n               the keys.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Don't touch me!\n\n               She leaps out of the car. The Cop turns off the car lights. \n               As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Hey!\n\n               He runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the \n               way. When he catches her, he grabs her arm. She struggles, \n               grabs the flashlight from his belt. She switches it on and \n               holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. He lunges \n               for it, knocks her down. They struggle. He rolls on top of \n               her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff \n               her. She writhes, knees him in the balls. She crawls away, \n               desperately clawing at loose stones. The Cop, angry now, \n               hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As \n               they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. The Cop, \n               winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, \n               kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. He pulls out his \n               radio mike.\n\n                                     COP\n                              (panting)\n                         Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty-\n                         six.

As the papers ruffle in \n               the wind, a little kitten swipes at them.\n\n               Frances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one \n               we saw at the opening of the film.

Everyone stares.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!...\n\n               When she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them \n               all, grandiloquently.\n\n               INT. FRANCES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               She's snoring in bed. Face down, spread-eagled. The light is \n               on. A whiskey bottle (three-quarters empty), a tumbler (three-\n               quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table.\n\n               The phone RINGS. She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes \n               then squeezes them together: hung over. Her arm flails out, \n               finds the light and turns it off.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Shit.\n\n               The phone keeps RINGING. Her arm gropes for it.\n\n               A loud POUNDING at the door.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         What the hell's going on here?\n                              (calls)\n                         Hold on!\n                              (answering phone)\n                         Hello...\n                              (we HEAR a dial tone)\n                         Hello?\n\n               The POUNDING at the door becomes violent.

Help!\n\n               Men stream into the room. Back-lit from the hall they look \n               like monsters, phantoms. They're carrying sticks.\n\n               Frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Don't kill me!

Leering \n               at her. Frances clutches at the shower curtain, trying to \n               cover herself.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Get your clothes on.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (crying)\n                         You have no right!

SANTA MONICA POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Frances is being led to the booking desk. All around her \n               Photographers snap her picture, and Reporters walk alongside \n               subjecting her to a never-ending barrage of questions. Frances \n               just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour-faced \n               SERGEANT facing her.\n\n                                     SERGEANT\n                         Name?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I don't believe this!

She shakes their \n               hands off her arms and enters. They slide the door shut. \n               Photographers press up to the bars.

Next \n               to the PROSECUTOR sits Tora, her jaw heavily bandaged, glaring \n               at Frances.

The Reporter \n               is delirious with joy: what a story!\n\n                                     REPORTER\n                         She's attacking your correspondent! \n                         Right here in the Court Building! \n                         Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone \n                         stop her!\n\n               Frances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to \n               the next booth... into the arms of Harry.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (a whisper)\n                         Harry!\n\n               Harry shakes his head. Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed \n               from behind and dragged toward the elevator.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I have a right! I have a right!\n\n                                     REPORTER\n                              (into phone)\n                         With what must surely be the final \n                         act of madness, the curtain falls on \n                         Frances Farmer's once promising \n                         career. The crazed blonde who at \n                         27...\n\n               Harry opens the door to his booth. The Reporter looks up at \n               him.\n\n                                     REPORTER\n                         Hold it a second, Bub...\n\n               Harry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the \n               face. The Reporter sags, out like a light. In the confusion, \n               no one has noticed a thing. Harry pulls the door shut.\n\n               INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n               Frances is sitting in a wooden chair. The venetian blinds \n               over the tall windows are almost completely closed. The room \n               is dim and terribly quiet. A WOMAN is murmuring something to \n               a kindly-looking JUDGE. Another MAN is standing beside her. \n               Frances can't quite make out the words.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         ...and we feel that this would be \n                         more appropriate.\n\n                                     JUDGE\n                         ...a difficult decision, but, I'm \n                         sure, the proper one.\n\n               He nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn \n               away from the bench. As they pass in front of one of the \n               tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman. It is Alma Styles.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         What?\n\n               She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. \n               Her mother's face appears by hers.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                              (whispering)\n                         It's alright now, little sister, \n                         everything's going to be just fine.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Mama, what's...\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, \n                         Frances. The Judge has put you under \n                         my care. I'll see you get the rest \n                         you need.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You're taking me home!\n\n               Two other WOMEN appear at either side of Frances and Lillian. \n               Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                              (smiling)\n                         First things first, little sister. \n                         Trust me.\n\n               She kisses Frances on the forehead. Frances looks at the two \n               Women. They are smiling understandingly at Lillian. Frances \n               looks a little alarmed.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY\n\n               A wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree-\n               lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a \n               white-washed wall are black letters: \"MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT \n               HOME\". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls \n               up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long \n               tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting \n               in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from \n               the previous scene.\n\n               The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set \n               back among some trees.\n\n               INT. A SMALL OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. \n               Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of \n               well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Why it's beautiful here! What a view!\n\n               Lillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares \n               accusingly back: she's not falling for that.\n\n               An awkward moment of silence. Lillian fidgets, doesn't know \n               what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. \n               SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating \n               smile) enters. He holds his right hand out to Frances.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr. \n                         Symington.\n\n               Frances stares at the proffered hand. Lillian steps in quickly \n               and takes it.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Good afternoon, Doctor.\n\n               The Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's \n               arm.\n\n                                     SYMINGTON\n                         I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. \n                         Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of \n                         a chance to talk later. Right now I \n                         think it's important that your \n                         daughter have a chance to settle in. \n                         Perhaps it would be best if you said \n                         your goodbyes here.\n\n               He smiles pleasantly. Lillian is obviously very put off by \n               the idea. She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the \n               window.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Oh. Well, I have some background \n                         that you should probably know about \n                         if you're...\n\n                                     SYMINGTON\n                         I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If \n                         you'll speak to the girl at the desk, \n                         she'll arrange an appointment.\n\n               He goes to the door and opens it. Lillian is momentarily at \n               a loss, but she acquiesces. She bends down and tightly hugs \n               Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         I'll be back real soon, little sister. \n                         You be a good girl.\n\n               She waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the \n               door.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (staring out window)\n                         Mama!\n\n               Lillian turns back expectantly.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (warningly)\n                         ...I want to go home, Mama.\n\n               Lillian looks to the Doctor, who nods sympathetically at \n               her.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         You'll see, little sister. Everything \n                         will be fine. The doctors know best.\n\n               She goes out and down the hall. The Doctor closes the door.\n\n                                     SYMINGTON\n                         I find these initial meetings to be \n                         much easier without the concerned \n                         relatives in attendance.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?\n\n                                     SYMINGTON\n                         Thanks are hardly necessary.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Aw, shucks, ma'am.

FRANCES' ROOM - DAY\n\n               Small, white, spartan and rather pleasant. Lillian is standing \n               by the window, testing the locks. She turns and goes to the \n               bed, fussing with the pillow, seeming very uncomfortable. \n               She pulls at the corners of the mattress.\n\n               The door opens and a tall, sullen-looking MATRON walks in. \n               Lillian doesn't pay much attention to her.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Not much on hospital corners, are \n                         you?\n\n                                     MATRON\n                         You Farmer?\n\n               Something in her tone makes Lillian look up.

Unhand that woman! \n                         That's Amelia Earhart!\n\n               Frances bursts out laughing. The Matron releases Lillian and \n               comes for Frances.\n\n               INT.

The Nurse is holding the syringe while a THIN NURSE and \n               an ATTENDANT stand by.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You've got to tell me what it is!\n\n                                     THIN NURSE\n                         It's insulin. It throws your body \n                         into shock.\n\n               Frances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to \n               believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic.\n\n                                     NURSE WITH HYPO\n                              (reassuringly)\n                         It's just vitamins.\n\n               This sounds more reasonable.

Good, now open \n                         your mouth a sec.\n\n               Frances does. The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her \n               teeth. Frances squirms, fights. The Attendant holds the bar \n               in place. And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo. \n               Frances goes rigid. Her eyes widen, her back arches. With a \n               loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse. The SCREEN BEGINS TO \n               FADE into bright white light. She is unconscious. The SCREEN \n               IS NOW BLANK.\n\n               EXT. COURTYARD - MEADOW WOOD - DAY\n\n               Frances sits beside Lillian on a bench. Other patients with \n               ground privileges wander aimlessly about.\n\n               There is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her \n               lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to \n               Frances. Frances seems restless.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         ...and here's the one from Duluth. A \n                         war widow with five children.

She's standing \n               over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle \n               pad. The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, \n               sadistic...

MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME - DAY\n\n               A few PATIENTS stroll about, visiting with relatives. Frances \n               lies on a chaise lounge. She's wearing a robe and dark \n               glasses, a big hat, and she seems to be sleeping. THE CAMERA \n               APPROACHES. Her hair is a mess, her skin splotchy. And \n               something is moving: her hand... one finger on one hand is \n               moving in agitated little bursts.

Oh, Harry!\n\n               She breaks down and weeps on Harry's shoulder. Harry looks \n               around warily.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I can't stay here anymore, you \n                         understand?

For an instant \n               Harry -- and we -- wonder if she really is crazy.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Frances! Did you hear what I said?\n\n               She turns. The Attendant turns. She smiles sweetly, madly.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Of course, Harry.\n\n               The Attendant is between her and Harry. We SEE her face turn \n               dark. She shoves the Attendant toward Harry and shouts:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (fiercely)\n                         Over the walls!\n\n               She runs. The Attendant staggers toward Harry, who knocks \n               him down with two punches. ANOTHER ATTENDANT runs up. Harry \n               whips out an icepick and brandishes it at them:\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         You want crazy?

GROVE OF TREES - DAY\n\n               Frances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                              (offering to lift her)\n                         Here.\n\n               Frances hugs him tightly, kisses him. He lifts her by the \n               waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself \n               up. Harry joins her. We SEE, over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr \n               waiting on a dirt road. Harry and Frances jump down as we \n               HEAR the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and \n               haul themselves up. As their heads pop over the top of the \n               wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a \n               cloud of dust...\n\n               INT. LINCOLN - DUSK - DAY\n\n               Harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate \n               on the road ahead. The RADIO DRONES quietly, a lazy saxophone \n               ballad. After a while, there's movement in the back seat and \n               Frances sits up. She yawns and stretches as Harry watches \n               her in the mirror.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Evening, gorgeous.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (yawning)\n                         That sure looks like fun...\n                              (leaning over front \n                              seat)\n                         You know how long it's been since I \n                         was behind the wheel?\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Forget it, Frances.

Salesman says, 'Gimme a \n                         martini.' Bartender's real nervous, \n                         he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. \n                         Big Otis is coming to town.'\n\n               Behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain.

So the bartender \n                         fixes him a martini real fast, grabs \n                         his money, and runs out the back. \n                         Salesman sits there sipping his \n                         martini,... he's got the bar all to \n                         himself...

This huge man stomps in. \n                         Picks up a chair and hurls it over \n                         the bar, smashing the mirror -- \n                         whiskey and glass flying everywhere.\n\n               TWO COPS appear at the window, looking in.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         He turns to the salesman: 'What the \n                         hell're you doing in here!' Salesman \n                         says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' \n                         'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you \n                         better get outa here! Big Otis is \n                         coming to town!'\n\n               Everyone laughs. A long moment of enjoyment. Then Frances \n               turns, looks out the window and sees the cops.\n\n               INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n               Hillier behind the bench.

A van pulls up to the front entrance. \n               Two MEN get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out. \n               She is strapped into a strait-jacket.

STEILACOOM HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny \n               linoleum-covered hallway.

TREATMENT ROOM - DAY\n\n               A MEDICAL STUDENT wheels a small electrical machine up to a \n               table. On the table Frances is securely strapped down.

One bed is empty, the bonds chewed \n               through. We find Frances sitting on the floor staring at a \n               hissing radiator. Her lips are caked with blood.

I'm ready \n                         to get on with it.\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         I know you believe that.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         ...Don't you?\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         I'm afraid not. You see, we observe \n                         things that you're unaware of: signs, \n                         indicators. Your problem cuts very \n                         deep, Frances, and we have to get at \n                         that deeper stuff so that when you \n                         do get out, you'll really feel secure. \n                         Does that make sense?\n\n               The Attendants lower her into the empty tub.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I \n                         know better.\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                              (smiling)\n                         Listen to yourself, Frances. The \n                         resistance, the anger in your voice.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (tightly)\n                         You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, \n                         tell me honestly, what do I have to \n                         do to get out of here?\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         Be patient, that's all. Take an \n                         interest in your treatment and don't \n                         dwell on your resentments. You'll be \n                         yourself again, I assure you.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         ...I see.\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         We'll talk more about this. I'll see \n                         you later.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         One question. If I'm not myself now, \n                         just who do you think I am?\n\n               The Doctor smiles sympathetically.\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         We'll talk.\n\n               As he turns to leave, Frances laughs triumphantly. The two \n               Attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with \n               ice-cold water.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         What the hell!\n\n               They shove a rubber bit between her teeth. She immediately \n               spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep \n               her teeth from chattering.\n\n               INT. STEILACOOM - DINING HALL - DAY\n\n               Everyone eating gruel. A parade of lunatics. The edge of \n               incipient violence is palpable. Frances eats listlessly. \n               Others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, \n               fondling each other. Suddenly a call starts up at the far \n               end of the hall. Other voices join in. At first we don't \n               understand it, but gradually the words become clear:\n\n                                     CHANT\n                         Come and get it! Come and get it! \n                         Come and get it!\n\n               The whole hall joins in. The Nurses make no effort to stop \n               it. Others at Frances' table smile at her, try to push her \n               to her feet. When they succeed, the hall breaks into applause \n               and a new chaotic chant:\n\n                                     CHANT\n                         We want Frances! We want Frances!\n\n               The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds. Everyone is \n               watching Frances. She climbs up on her bench. Her eyes are \n               glazed, her face expressionless. This feels like some kind \n               of automatic behavior. She takes an exaggerated posture and \n               speaks in almost a whisper:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Come and get it...\n\n               The hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping.\n\n               Frances climbs down from her bench. That was the entire \n               performance.\n\n               EXT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT\n\n               Two dark FIGURES move stealthily along the shadow of the \n               main building. A little ways ahead, a door opens, sending a \n               shaft of light across the ground. The two Men duck back into \n               the shadows. Five young SOLDIERS EXIT, paying off and waving \n               goodbye to one of the Orderlies. The door closes. They head \n               off down the road laughing and joking together.\n\n               The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door. \n               They try the handle. It opens. The first one in is Harry, \n               followed by the other Man carrying a rolled-up bundle.\n\n               INT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT\n\n               We SEE Harry and the other Man, now wearing a white Doctor's \n               coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway. They come to a \n               large door with a barred window. The Man fiddles with a \n               keyring and unlocks the door. They enter. We HEAR the door \n               lock behind them.\n\n               INT. WARD - NIGHT\n\n               Just inside the door the Doctor flicks on a flashlight and \n               they walk down the center of the room. The beam of light \n               sweeps over women PATIENTS in their cots, crammed side-by-\n               side. Some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling. \n               A few smile invitingly at the two Men, whispering obscenities. \n               The light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner \n               between the wall and a cot. It is Frances. Harry goes to \n               her, putting his arms around her. She is very heavily sedated. \n               Tears spring to Harry's eyes.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                              (whispering)\n                         Frances!

Let me look her \n                         over.\n\n               Harry is on the verge of tears.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Oh, God! Let's get her out of here \n                         tonight, right now! Let's take her \n                         with us!\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets \n                         out legally, they can't come after \n                         her.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Look at her! She'll never pass that \n                         sanity test tomorrow...\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just \n                         hold her.\n                              (pulling a hypodermic \n                              from his pocket)\n                         Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll \n                         clear her head. She'll wake up feeling \n                         smart and sailright through the \n                         hearing.\n\n               Harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her \n               arm. Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Yeah... she knows about these. Shut \n                         her up.\n\n               Harry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth \n               and the Doctor injects her. Her arm is covered with sores.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                              (tenderly)\n                         You'll be okay, honey.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         We're all square now, Harry. Right?\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         All square, Doc.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you \n                         again.\n\n               Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just \n               hear her:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I love you, Harry.

WARD - NIGHT\n\n               Frances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects \n               herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I realize now that I was a very sick \n                         woman.\n\n                                     WOMEN IN WARD\n                         Sick!

We realize that if Frances can handle this, \n               she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually \n               diminish as she concludes her speech.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         And I was not taking responsibility \n                         for my actions. But now, thanks to \n                         your treatment, I feel ready to face \n                         myself, ready to resume the career \n                         which I so single-handedly shattered. \n                         I only hope... I hope I can make you \n                         all proud of me. Thank you. Thank \n                         you so much.\n\n               The room is silent now. A very odd moment. To their \n               astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her...\n\n               EXT. FARMER HOUSE - SUNNY DAY\n\n               The vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling. The \n               house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed \n               lawn that some effort has recently been made...\n\n               A car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets \n               out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks \n               around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights \n               spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, \n               followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches.\n\n               INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Frances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping \n               tea and answering questions. Frances is uncomfortable.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Of course, she hasn't anything \n                         definite in mind.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         No. No, it all depends on what offers \n                         I get.\n\n                                     REPORTER\n                         Who did your hair, Frances?\n\n               She touches it shyly. It's swept up in a continental style.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Well, I like to try different styles. \n                         Sometimes if you're old-fashioned \n                         enough, you find you're modern. Right, \n                         Mama?\n\n               Lillian laughs.\n\n                                     REPORTER\n                         What do you think of all this, Mrs. \n                         Farmer?\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         It's a miracle. Just a miracle.\n\n               EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The porch light goes out. Shadows pass over the curtained \n               windows. Across the street a match flares. Harry is leaning \n               against a tree. He lights a cigarette and settles back to \n               wait.\n\n               INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Lillian walks from room to room turning off lights. Frances \n               is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray. Very \n               domestic, out of character. She carries the tray into the \n               kitchen.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Oh, just leave those things for now.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll \n                         wash them in the morning.\n\n               Lillian smiles warmly at her.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         You know, little sister, I never \n                         resented you for refusing to see me \n                         in the... the hospital. I knew you \n                         had to manage on your own before you \n                         could come back.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Thank you for understanding, Mama.\n\n               Lillian links her arm with Frances' and they go upstairs \n               together.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Little sister, I don't want you to \n                         feel any rush to get back to work. I \n                         want you to rest... for a while \n                         anyway.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I will, I promise.\n\n               They hug each other.\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         Good night, dear.\n\n               Lillian waits until Frances has shut her door before closing \n               hers.\n\n               EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The front door opens and Frances, suitcase in hand, slips \n               out onto the porch. She eases the door shut behind her, \n               tiptoes down the steps and, without looking back, starts \n               down the road.\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Frances rounds the corner, then sees him: Harry, standing by \n               his car, smiling.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Where to?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Oh Harry...\n\n               She approaches him tentatively.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         This is it, kid.

You don't need Dwayne Steele \n                         or Odets or your mother. You need \n                         me.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         I know, but... There were so many \n                         people in there, Harry. Every time I \n                         turned around someone was pressing \n                         against me... watching, looking over \n                         my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, \n                         sticking things into me. When I feel \n                         somebody near me now... anybody... \n                         my skin starts to crawl.\n\n               Long beat. She turns and stares at him sadly.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You can't change the things they did \n                         to me, Harry. Only I can do that... \n                         by myself.\n\n               He nods slowly.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Been a lot of years, you know.

You're the only person who ever... \n                         It's just... Can't you wait for me?\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         I don't know.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (getting frantic)\n                         Yes you do. If you love me you can \n                         wait, right? A month, six months, \n                         whatever it takes.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Right.

Together for an instant. Then she shivers as if \n               the contact were too much.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (disentangling)\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n               He nods, looks at her.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         I'll be seeing you, kid.\n\n               He turns and walks slowly to his car.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN\n\n               Barren desert. The middle of nowhere. A lone male HITCHHIKER, \n               poor, stands at a crossroads. A car coming the wrong direction \n               raises dust along the highway. It slows, stops, and lets \n               Frances out. She is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt. \n               She has a heavy tan.\n\n               She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He \n               responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers \n               passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm:\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         Pretty morning.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (nods)\n                         It's always beautiful at this time. \n                         Peaceful...\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         And no people.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Yes.\n\n               Beat.\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         Where you goin'?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Wherever they're going, I'm going.\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         Yeah, I know what that's like... \n                         Where you been?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Well, I was picking fruit with some \n                         migrant workers until...\n\n               She stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a \n               cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her \n               gesture.\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         What's the matter?\n\n               Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away.\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         They're looking for you, huh?\n\n               She's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         What'd you do?\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You know, I've never been able to \n                         figure that out.\n\n               He laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around \n               her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings:\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         I've got a little whiskey here, warm \n                         you up.\n\n               She smiles, truly grateful:\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Thank you.\n\n               Then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up.\n\n               The car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         Shit!\n\n                                     HITCHHIKER\n                         Run!\n\n               She does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to \n               impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are \n               slowly, inevitably, gaining on her.\n\n               EXT. SMALL TOWN JAIL - DAY\n\n               Frances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly \n               SHERIFF.

Doors slam. Steps come up the walk and \n               onto the porch. The door opens and Frances and Ernest enter. \n               Lillian rises to face her daughter.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (coldly)\n                         Do I go right away or do I have time \n                         to take a bath?\n\n                                     LILLIAN\n                         I was hoping for a kind word, little \n                         sister.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         You were hoping for a kind word?! \n                         You're my mother!

STEILACOOM - VIOLENT WARD - NIGHT\n\n               The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their \n               hair cropped very short. The walls are corrugated tin nailed \n               to bare wood framing. The place looks like an enormous tool \n               shed. The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops. \n\n               These are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. Everyone here \n               has lost any notion of what they might have once been. Their \n               faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. \n               Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are \n               pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the \n               dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, \n               chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, \n               their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are \n               involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some \n               in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of \n               men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to \n               us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their \n               cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the \n               back.\n\n               We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the \n               object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread-\n               eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms \n               and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is \n               squirming violently on top of her. Frances' eyes are open \n               but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. She is \n               passive and unresisting. She is reciting to herself, over \n               and over.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                         We shall hear the angels, we shall \n                         see the whole sky all diamonds...\n\n               Two of the SOLDIERS, waiting their turn, are smoking \n               cigarettes and chatting idly.\n\n                                     SOLDIER #1\n                         ...Best deal I ever made. Twenty \n                         bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star.\n\n                                     SOLDIER #2\n                         Yeah, it's worth it I guess.\n\n                                     SOLDIER #1\n                         What's she saying, anyway?\n\n                                     SOLDIER #2\n                         Who knows. She's crazy, ain't she?\n\n               Frances keeps reciting as one rapist gets off. The Soldiers \n               cheer as another quickly takes his place.\n\n               EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY\n\n               A heavy snow is falling. From the corrugated-tin Violent \n               Ward, a thin white hand protrudes from a narrow window to \n               catch a snowflake.\n\n               As it opens and closes, capturing individual flakes, a VOICE \n               BEGINS TO SING \"You Are My Sunshine...\". We recognize Frances' \n               voice, still surprisingly strong and steady.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

STEILACOOM - HOLDING WARD - DAY\n\n               Frances, barely conscious, lies strapped to a bed. Doyle and \n               an ORDERLY approach her. Doyle nods toward her as if to say: \n               that one. He and the Orderly unstrap her.\n\n                                     FRANCES\n                              (to Doyle)\n                         Harry?

The Orderly helps her up onto a gurney.\n\n               She lies down. Doyle nods to the Orderly, who starts pushing \n               her.\n\n               She is wheeled out and down:\n\n               THE HALL\n\n               Past other patients, doctors, etc. We see some of this from \n               her point of view.\n\n               She goes through two swinging doors, down another hall... at \n               the end of which a man opens a door. She is pushed onto a:\n\n               STAGE\n\n               She is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In \n               the background we HEAR a voice:\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)\n                         One merely inserts the leucotome \n                         beneath the eyelid and presses up \n                         into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating \n                         it so as to sever the nervous \n                         connections between the thalamofrontal \n                         radiation and the body of the brain.\n\n               The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We \n               cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)\n                         Because of the speed and simplicity \n                         of the operation, I am able, as you \n                         are seeing, to perform the procedure \n                         on ten patients in less than a half \n                         hour.\n\n               Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round \n               and round. The voice drones on.\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)\n                         The operation is completely painless \n                         and can be performed without any \n                         sedative whatsoever.\n\n               We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the \n               patient on the adjacent gurney.\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON\n                         We have always known that this form \n                         of radical treatment was effective, \n                         but until now it couldn't be applied \n                         on a large scale. The old procedure \n                         required a full day's work by a \n                         surgical team to perform a single \n                         operation. In the same time, working \n                         alone, I can treat fifty.\n\n               Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's \n               happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like \n               instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON\n                         This procedure works best on patients \n                         with extreme over-reactions to \n                         emotional stimuli. It can also be \n                         used as a last resort on those who \n                         seem impervious to other forms of \n                         treatment.\n\n               The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.\n\n                                     DR. HARLINGTON\n                         In plain language, my technique severs \n                         the nerves which give emotional energy \n                         to ideas. Along with the cure comes \n                         a loss of affect... a kind of \n                         emotional flattening...\n\n               Frances turns away and stares at the fan again.
