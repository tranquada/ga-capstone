We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n</b>                         No one ever came up to me and said, \n                         'You're a fool. There isn't such a \n                         thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing \n                         you.'\n\n<b>               FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY\n</b>\n               On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, \n               it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A \n               girl's face breaks through.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n</b>                         It wasn't a murder. I think God just \n                         died of old age. And when I realized \n                         He wasn't any more, it didn't shock \n                         me. It seemed natural and right.\n\n               The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like \n               the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She \n               swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then \n               climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n</b>                         And yet I began to wonder what the \n                         minister meant when he said, 'God, \n                         the Father, sees even the smallest \n                         sparrow fall. He watches over all \n                         his children.' That jumbled it all \n                         up for me.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Frances \n               sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. \n               Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden \n               in the sun.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES (V.O.)\n</b>                         But still sometimes I found that God \n                         was useful to remember, especially \n                         when I lost things that were \n                         important. 'Please God, let me find \n                         my red hat with the blue trimmings.'\n\n<b>               INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING\n</b>\n               Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying \n               back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN \n               FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding \n               from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         It usually worked. God became a \n                         superfather that couldn't spank me. \n                         But if I wanted a thing badly enough, \n                         He arranged it.\n\n               ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening \n               to his daughter read.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         But if God loved all of His children \n                         equally, why did He bother about my \n                         red hat and let other people lose \n                         their fathers and mothers for always?\n\n               Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of \n               her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.\n\n<b>                                     ERNEST\n</b>                         Bye, baby.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         See you next weekend, Dad.\n\n               He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at \n               Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         I began to see that He didn't have \n                         much to do about hats or people dying \n                         or anything. They happened whether \n                         He wanted them to or not, and He \n                         stayed in Heaven and pretended not \n                         to notice.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

Above the proscenium \n               is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner \n               hangs: \"NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931.\"\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         I wondered a little why God was such \n                         a useless thing. It seemed a waste \n                         of time to have Him. After that He \n                         became less and less, until He was... \n                         nothingness.\n\n               The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local \n               dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there \n               also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking \n               woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the \n               auditorium, looking a little worried.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         I felt rather proud that I had found \n                         the truth myself, without help from \n                         anyone. It puzzled me that other \n                         people hadn't found out, too. God \n                         was gone. We had reached past Him. \n                         Why couldn't they see it? It still \n                         puzzles me.\n\n               Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some \n               response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering \n               of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to \n               her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         You're going straight to hell, Frances \n                         Farmer!\n\n               A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN \n               HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman \n               continues to glare at Frances.\n\n               Frances stares back, dumbfounded.\n\n<b>                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

On a \n               white-washed wall are black letters: \"MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT \n               HOME\". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls \n               up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long \n               tree-lined driveway.

Lillian fidgets, doesn't know \n               what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. \n               SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating \n               smile) enters.

The Attendants strap Frances into a \n               bath as Dr. Doyle enters.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                              (speaking with \n                              difficulty)\n                         Doctor, it may sound odd, but I \n                         believe I've profited from my stay \n                         here. It's just what I've needed, to \n                         get away like this. But I'm \n                         recuperated now. I've had lots of \n                         time to think and I've made a few \n                         decisions about my life. I'm ready \n                         to get on with it.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                         I know you believe that.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         ...Don't you?\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                         I'm afraid not. You see, we observe \n                         things that you're unaware of: signs, \n                         indicators. Your problem cuts very \n                         deep, Frances, and we have to get at \n                         that deeper stuff so that when you \n                         do get out, you'll really feel secure. \n                         Does that make sense?\n\n               The Attendants lower her into the empty tub.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I \n                         know better.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                              (smiling)\n                         Listen to yourself, Frances.

Doctor, \n                         tell me honestly, what do I have to \n                         do to get out of here?\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                         Be patient, that's all. Take an \n                         interest in your treatment and don't \n                         dwell on your resentments.

If I'm not myself now, \n                         just who do you think I am?\n\n               The Doctor smiles sympathetically.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                         We'll talk.\n\n               As he turns to leave, Frances laughs triumphantly. The two \n               Attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with \n               ice-cold water.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         What the hell!\n\n               They shove a rubber bit between her teeth. She immediately \n               spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep \n               her teeth from chattering.\n\n<b>               INT. STEILACOOM - DINING HALL - DAY\n</b>\n               Everyone eating gruel. A parade of lunatics. The edge of \n               incipient violence is palpable. Frances eats listlessly. \n               Others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, \n               fondling each other. Suddenly a call starts up at the far \n               end of the hall. Other voices join in. At first we don't \n               understand it, but gradually the words become clear:\n\n<b>                                     CHANT\n</b>                         Come and get it! Come and get it! \n                         Come and get it!\n\n               The whole hall joins in. The Nurses make no effort to stop \n               it. Others at Frances' table smile at her, try to push her \n               to her feet. When they succeed, the hall breaks into applause \n               and a new chaotic chant:\n\n<b>                                     CHANT\n</b>                         We want Frances! We want Frances!\n\n               The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds. Everyone is \n               watching Frances. She climbs up on her bench. Her eyes are \n               glazed, her face expressionless. This feels like some kind \n               of automatic behavior. She takes an exaggerated posture and \n               speaks in almost a whisper:\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         Come and get it...\n\n               The hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping.\n\n               Frances climbs down from her bench. That was the entire \n               performance.\n\n<b>               EXT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Two dark FIGURES move stealthily along the shadow of the \n               main building. A little ways ahead, a door opens, sending a \n               shaft of light across the ground. The two Men duck back into \n               the shadows. Five young SOLDIERS EXIT, paying off and waving \n               goodbye to one of the Orderlies. The door closes. They head \n               off down the road laughing and joking together.\n\n               The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door. \n               They try the handle. It opens. The first one in is Harry, \n               followed by the other Man carrying a rolled-up bundle.\n\n<b>               INT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We SEE Harry and the other Man, now wearing a white Doctor's \n               coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway. They come to a \n               large door with a barred window. The Man fiddles with a \n               keyring and unlocks the door. They enter. We HEAR the door \n               lock behind them.\n\n<b>               INT. WARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Just inside the door the Doctor flicks on a flashlight and \n               they walk down the center of the room. The beam of light \n               sweeps over women PATIENTS in their cots, crammed side-by-\n               side. Some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling. \n               A few smile invitingly at the two Men, whispering obscenities. \n               The light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner \n               between the wall and a cot. It is Frances. Harry goes to \n               her, putting his arms around her. She is very heavily sedated. \n               Tears spring to Harry's eyes.\n\n<b>                                     HARRY\n</b>                              (whispering)\n                         Frances!

STEILACOOM - VIOLENT WARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their \n               hair cropped very short. The walls are corrugated tin nailed \n               to bare wood framing. The place looks like an enormous tool \n               shed. The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops. \n\n               These are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. Everyone here \n               has lost any notion of what they might have once been. Their \n               faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. \n               Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are \n               pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the \n               dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, \n               chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, \n               their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are \n               involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some \n               in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of \n               men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to \n               us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their \n               cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the \n               back.\n\n               We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the \n               object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread-\n               eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms \n               and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is \n               squirming violently on top of her. Frances' eyes are open \n               but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. She is \n               passive and unresisting. She is reciting to herself, over \n               and over.\n\n<b>                                     FRANCES\n</b>                         We shall hear the angels, we shall \n                         see the whole sky all diamonds...\n\n               Two of the SOLDIERS, waiting their turn, are smoking \n               cigarettes and chatting idly.\n\n<b>                                     SOLDIER #1\n</b>                         ...Best deal I ever made.
