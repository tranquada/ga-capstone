A BUTTON-EYED\n          DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a\n          small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING\n          HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.\n\n          \n          The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-\n          fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -\n          is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is\n          opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS\n          go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-\n          eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is\n          removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside\n          out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.\n\n          \n          Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial\n          features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a\n          fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a\n          button drawer.\n\n          \n          The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its\n          new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and\n\n          BACK INTO THE NIGHT.\n\n          \n\n          LAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY\n\n          \n          WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with\n          tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a\n          damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads \"Pink\n          Palace, Apartment for Rent\".\n\n          \n          MR.

A tired MOVING VAN\n          backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -\n          suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck\n          and disappears around the side of the house.

APRIL SPINK,\n          a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys\n          the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and\n          furniture.

The job finished, Mover 2 heads\n          down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature\n          from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers\n          signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed\n          in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and\n          the door is shut.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME\n\n          \n          ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the\n          POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is\n          rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack\n          into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks\n          right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.\n          OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it\n          races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH\n          to investigate.\n\n          \n          CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW\n          RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a\n          CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a\n          skeptical face.\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances\n          furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and\n          moves diagonally away from the house.\n\n          \n          NEW Angle, SPY POV.

She\n          reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.\n          She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a\n          DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.\n\n          \n          CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-\n          eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his\n          hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy\n          and follows the girl.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          MONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME\n\n          \n\n          AFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME\n\n          \n          Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds\n          an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After\n          rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell\n          into her shoulder bag.\n\n          \n          ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from\n          the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.\n          Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it\n          up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND\n          blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up\n          into the air.\n\n          \n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER\n\n          \n          SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden\n          behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view\n          Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She\n          steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the\n          rotted wood, stopping her.\n\n          \n          WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones\n          that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head\n          our way.\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Hello?...   Who's there?\n\n          \n          She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE\n          UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked\n          out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat\n          hops onto the stone wall.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT.\n\n\n          \n          Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an\n          ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old\n          apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a\n          harvest cart.\n\n          \n          DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of\n          TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks\n          out for her pursuer.\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall\n          grass. She can't see him but she knows something is\n          there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the\n          stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!\n\n          \n          STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both\n          angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    You scared me to death, you mangy thing!\n\n          \n          Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl\n          as she stands. She exhales.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    I'm just looking for an old well.

She grasps the forks of her stick,\n          closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,\n\n          SAYS:\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...\n                    the well!\n\n          \n          ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into\n          frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a\n          button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.\n          STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.\n\n          \n          UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,\n          Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-\n          lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S\n          COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                           (freaked out)\n\n                    AHHHHH!\n\n          \n          He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the\n          bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to\n          WHACK HIM with her forked stick.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n\n                    GET AWAY FROM ME--\n\n          \n          He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the\n          ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP\n          onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,\n          THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-\n          EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.\n\n          \n          And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and\n          this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and\n          Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.\n\n          \n          Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE\n          LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims\n          it around.\n\n          \n\n                                 WYBIE\n\n                           (OBLIVIOUS)\n                    Hoo!

But it's just her NORMAL ROOM:\n          moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.\n\n          \n          She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she\n          left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it\n          up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops,\n          noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n\n                           (GASPING)\n                    It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME\n\n\n          \n          Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks\n          behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was\n          only a dream.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n\n                           (SOFTLY)\n                    Huh?\n\n          \n          She shakes her head and pushes the door shut.

Mel and Charlie finish their \"Go Lean\n          Breakfast Twigs\" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied\n          with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts\n          her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the\n          windows.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    It was incredibly real, Mom!

HOUSE, FRONT PORCH - MORNING\n\n\n          \n          It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house\n          and grounds. Coraline \u00ad yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS\n          in hand \u00ad opens the front door. Stepping out onto the\n          porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she\n          picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...\n\n          \n          Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    Ohh, Poo-eeeee!\n\n          \n          She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads\n          \"Bobinsky there\" with an arrow that points up long,\n          winding outside stairs. With an \"oh well\" shrug, she goes\n          up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT.

She ducks and he reaches past\n          her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it\n          shut.\n          The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and\n          shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants.

The\n          further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees\n          become.\n\n          \n          She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    And what do you think you're doing?\n\n          \n          The cat trots along by her feet.

But how can you walk away from\n                    something and still come back to it?\n\n          \n          The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its\n          head to one side.\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    Walk around the world.\n\n          \n\n                                   CORALINE\n                    Small world.\n\n          \n          Coraline shivers.

Before\n          Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Stop, he's one of the circus mice!\n\n          \n          With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse\n          into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a\n          QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse\n          TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He\n          drops the rat on the ground.\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    I don't like rats at the best of times,\n                    but this one was sounding an alarm.\n\n          \n          The cat picks the rat up and heads off.

HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME\n\n\n          \n          Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,\n          TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for\n          danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of\n          anything.\n\n          \n          She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS\n          with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the\n          door swings open into the pitch black living room. The\n          hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other\n          Little Door on the far wall, cracked open.

The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing\n          BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens\n          in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The\n          radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a\n          serving bug.\n\n          \n          The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.\n\n          \n\n                                 OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)\n                    They say even the proudest --\n\n          \n          The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her\n          sitting on it.\n\n          \n\n                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)\n                    --spirit can be broken ... with love.\n\n          \n          She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out\n          in a behold my handiwork gesture.\n\n          \n          A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the\n          Other Mother.\n\n          \n          The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.\n\n          \n\n                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)\n                    Of course, chocolate never hurts.

She BLACKS OUT a moment.\n\n          \n          WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and\n          knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white\n          gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and\n          circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost\n          eye.\n\n          \n          Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,\n          turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the\n\n          DARK BUTTON SHADOW.\n\n          \n          Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her\n          knee.

The band of light\n          that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.\n\n          \n          In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -\n          CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust\n          leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the\n          eclipse paused.\n\n          \n          There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.\n\n          \n          Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,\n          licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    I think I mentioned that I don't like\n                    rats at the best of times.\n\n          \n          Coraline smiles, walks towards him.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    I think you might have said something\n                    like that.\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    It looked like you needed this one,\n                    however.\n\n          \n          He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.\n\n          \n          She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the\n\n          YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Thank you.\n\n          \n          Looks towards house.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    I'm heading inside.

The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in\n          one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED\n          OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.\n\n          \n          ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has\n          begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of\n          paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.\n\n          \n          The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the\n          SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white\n          light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant\n          hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing\n          louder.\n\n          \n          UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply\n          alarmed, they look from one direction to another.\n\n          \n          POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the\n          driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the\n          topiary elephant and bird.\n\n          \n          DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE\n          PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY\n\n          SHRINKING ISLAND!\n\n          \n          NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their\n          feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat\n          makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the\n          movie!\n\n          \n          Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her\n          guardian angel.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    Come on, quickly!\n\n          \n          The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up\n          the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She\n          gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME\n\n\n          \n          It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and\n          intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills\n          from the other living room.\n\n          \n          Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,\n          past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room\n          where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on\n          glass.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME\n\n\n          \n          A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS\n          in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their\n          lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings\n          twitching uncontrollably.\n\n          \n          Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign\n          of her parents.\n\n          \n          ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other\n          Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at\n          all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.\n\n          \n          The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n                    So, you're back....\n\n          \n          Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face\n          towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and\n          peeling - her true face.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)\n                    And you brought vermin with you.\n\n          \n          Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful\n          sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    No, I ... I brought a friend.\n\n          \n          The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the\n          bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now\n          an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.\n\n          \n          She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to\n          Coraline's face.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n\n                           (FLATLY)\n                    You know I love you.\n\n          \n          Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    You, you have a very funny way of showing\n                    it.\n\n          \n          The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand\n          outstretched.\n\n          \n\n                                    BELDAM\n                    So?     Where are they - the ghost eyes?\n\n          \n          Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and\n          starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.\n\n          \n\n                                   CORALINE\n                    Hold on.\n\n          \n          And pulls back.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    We aren't finished yet, are we?\n\n          \n          The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n                    No, I suppose not. After all, you still\n                    need to find your old parents, don't you?\n                    Too bad you won't have this.\n\n          \n          She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and\n          FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while\n          the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.\n\n          \n          ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT\n          in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.\n\n          \n\n                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)\n                    Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll\n                    never let you go!\n\n          \n          Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the\n          armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam\n          to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to\n          her then nods.\n\n          \n          She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she\n          can muster, says:\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    I already know where you've hidden them.\n\n          \n          The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and\n          sceptical.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n                    Well... produce them.\n\n          \n          Coraline points to the little door.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    They're behind that door.\n\n          \n          The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and\n          speaks very quietly.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n                    Oh, they are, are they?\n\n          \n          A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS\n          TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,\n          as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the\n          armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.\n\n          \n          Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on\n          wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming\n          from?!\n\n          \n          The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES\n          SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --\n\n          \n\n                                 CAT\n                    There!\n\n          \n          -- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -\n\n          OPAQUE WITH FROST.\n\n          \n          C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass\n          is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see\n          the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED\n          PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back\n          from them.\n\n          \n\n                                  CORALINE\n\n                            (WHISPERING)\n                    Mom.   Dad!\n\n          \n          ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's\n          discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns\n          to Coraline, expectantly.\n\n          \n\n                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all\n                    right.\n\n          \n          The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns\n          it, leaves the key in place.\n\n          \n          She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song\n          voice.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM\n                    You're wrong, Coraline!\n\n          \n          She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-\n          web tunnel.\n\n          \n          ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -\n          obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's\n          thinking very hard.\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)\n\n                           (PITYING)\n                    They aren't there.\n\n          \n          She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK\n          BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the\n          Beldam softly gloats:\n\n          \n\n                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)\n                    Now you're going to stay here forever.\n\n          \n          Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the\n          fury she can.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    No ...

The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY\n          at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one\n          thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the\n          Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then\n          SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the\n          ground!\n\n          \n          She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!\n\n          \n          Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when\n          it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming\n          through cracks!

A split-\n          second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A\n          CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door\n          and lock, hold. It's over...\n\n          \n          Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's\n          ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows\n          a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first\n          since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue\n          with white clouds.\n\n          \n          She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the\n          ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.\n\n          \n          She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes\n          and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!\n\n          \n          She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her\n          hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny\n          bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She\n          looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.\n          She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and\n          neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.\n\n          \n          As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,\n          Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does\n          this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY\n          REAL MOTHER calls to her.\n\n          \n\n                                 MEL (O.S.)\n                    Coraline?

They\n          gather around Coraline and bow their heads.\n\n          \n\n                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST\n\n                           (SIGHS)\n                    It is over and done with ... for us.\n\n          \n          Silent beat.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    What about...me?\n\n          \n          The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS\n\n          OUT:\n\n          \n\n                                 TALL GIRL GHOST\n                    You're in terrible danger, girl!\n\n          \n          Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.\n\n          \n\n                                  CORALINE\n                    But how?   I locked the door!?\n\n          \n\n                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST\n                    It's the key, miss, there's only one and\n                    the Beldam will find it.\n\n          \n          The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out\n          in front of Coraline. She grabs it.\n\n          \n          The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.\n\n          \n\n                                 BOY GHOST\n\n                           (WHISPERS)\n                    Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ...\n                    thou art still ... living...\n\n          \n          They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and\n          faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --\n\n          \n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\n          \n\n          -- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK\n          above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by\n          her side.\n\n          \n          Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES\n          ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the\n          key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice\n\n          PANICKED:\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s-\n                    somewhere she can never ...\n\n          \n          The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs\n          her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down\n          and blocks her way.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    Outta my way!\n\n          \n          She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares\n          after her\n\n          \n\n          INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY, LOWER HALL, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n\n          \n          Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads\n          down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits\n          frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE\n          DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.\n\n          WE ROCKET IN AND--\n\n          \n\n                                                         JUMP CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n\n          \n          The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at\n          the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM\n          CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of\n          Coraline!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME\n\n          \n          Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY\n          that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like\n          fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her\n          father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl,\n                    I think you are so nice ...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT. ORCHARD - SAME\n\n\n          \n          She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with\n          BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    ... I give you bowls of porridge\n                    And I give you bowls of ice cream.\n\n          \n          LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND\n          drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)\n                    I give you lots of kisses,\n                    And I give you lots of hugs ...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT. WELL - SAME\n\n\n          \n          Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the\n          well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    ... But I never give you sandwiches\n                    With grease and worms and mung beans.\n\n          \n          Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS\n          behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.\n\n          \n          Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one\n          side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,\n          she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's\n          around her neck.\n\n          \n          The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS\n\n          HER!\n\n          \n          Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.\n\n          \n          The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the\n          air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!\n\n          \n          Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught\n          between the key string and her neck!\n\n          \n          The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the\n\n          LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!\n\n          \n          A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN\n          SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his\n          own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining\n          electric bike!\n\n          \n\n                                  WYBIE\n\n                    YAHHHHH!!!!\n\n          \n          Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the\n          confused HAND with his slug tongs!\n\n          \n          He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to\n          throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his\n          handlebars.\n\n          \n          OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND\n          HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just\n          manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,\n          caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and\n          face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS\n          FINGERS to make him fall!\n\n          \n\n                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)\n\n                           (STRUGGLING)\n                    Get off!!\n\n          \n          Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her\n          BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the\n          crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.\n          It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.\n          The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It\n          crouches to attack her!\n\n          \n          And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG\n          ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE\n          LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.\n\n          \n          Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing\n          hard - removes the key and string from around her sore\n          neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the\n          needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together\n          with the string. The key is left attached.\n\n          \n          The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and\n          DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,\n          they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in\n          the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover\n          in place.\n\n          \n          Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his\n          injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He\n          looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little\n          with moonlight.\n\n          \n\n                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)\n                    I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you\n                    about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline.\n\n          \n          Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,\n          stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the\n          first time.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    Why did you change your mind?\n\n          \n          He walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his\n          jacket.\n\n          \n\n                                 WYBIE\n                    W-well, Gramma showed me this picture,\n                    after I called you crazy?\n\n          \n          He hands it to her.\n\n          \n          ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed\n          in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink\n          Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks\n          just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH\n          BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.\n\n          \n\n                                 WYBIE (O.C.)

Behind them, blossoms fall\n          like snow in the orchard.\n\n          \n\n                                 CORALINE\n                    The sweet ghost girl.\n\n          \n          Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the\n          distance.\n\n          \n\n                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)\n                    Wyborne!
