PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n</b>\nIt's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched\non the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters\ncarrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She\nseems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,\ndressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\tOh, hi.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN\n</b>\t\t(apologetically)\n\tHi, I was in the neighborhood and thought\n\tI'd see --\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\tI think he's in a conference.\n\tUnfortunately.  I'm really sorry.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN\n</b>\tWould you just try him?  You never know.\n\tAs long as I'm here.  You never know.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\tOf course.  Please have a seat.\n\nThe old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her\nlap.  She stares politely straight ahead.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(quietly into headset)\n\tIt's her -- I know, but couldn't you just\n\t-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's\n\told and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.\n\t\t(to old woman)\n\tI'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.\n\tIt's a crazy time of year for us.\n\nThe receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the\ncorner.  Its ornaments are holograms.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN\n</b>\tThis book -- It's essential that people\n\tread it because --\n\t\t(gravely, patting the\n\t\t manuscript)\n\t-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\t\t(nodding sympathetically)\n\tMaybe after the holidays then.\n\n<b>INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nThe old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway\nhall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and\npasses several archway with letters printed above them.  When\nshe arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a\nslot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She\nsits in the chair; it rises.\n\n<b>INT. TUBE -DAY\n</b>\nThe woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a\nline of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other\nchairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as\nshe and the others travel over New York City in the tube.\nThere are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the\nskyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.\nIt's called:\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nThis serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits\nfollow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.\nTheir faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.\n\n<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n<b>SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER\n</b>\nEvery doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,\nmagazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic\nseascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,\ncan be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are\nshelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and\nClementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a\nfaux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's\ndecidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tMay I help you?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(approaching reception area)\n\tYeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.\n\tMierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tYes, please have a seat.  He'll be right\n\twith you.\n\nClementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks\nup a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.\n\n<b>INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nMary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK (O.S.)\n</b>\tYes?\n\nMary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,\nprofessional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tHoward, your one o'clock.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\t\t(not looking up)\n\tThanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.\n\nShe smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally\nclear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to\nleave.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(looking up)\n\tMary...\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(turning back)\n\tYes?\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tOrder me a pastrami for after?\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tCole slaw, ice tea?\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\t\t(nodding)\n\tThanks.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tWelcome, Howard.\n\nShe smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,\nspindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tBoo.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tHi.\n\nShe glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tBarely seen you all morning, kiddo.\n\nHe leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him\noff.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(reprimanding whisper)\n\tStan... c'mon...\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tSorry.  I just --\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(somewhat guiltilly)\n\tIt's just...y'know... I mean...\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tI know.  Anyway --\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tAnyway, I've got to do my tap\n\tdance here.\n\nShe indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tSee you later, alligator.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t'kay.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tHey, if you're ordering lunch for\n\tMierzwiak, would you --\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tI better do this, Stan.\n\nStan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMs. Kruczynski?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (O.S.)\n</b>\tHi.\n\nAfter a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary\nleads her down the hall, not looking back.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(professionally courteous)\n\tHow are you today?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tOkay, I guess.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(at Mierzwiak's office)\n\tHere we are.\n\nMierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tMs. Kruczynski, please come in.\n\nClementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and\ncloses the door, leaving them alone.\n\n<b>INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nMierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee\ntable and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak\nsits across from her.  He smiles.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tHow are you today?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tOkay, I guess.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\t\t(nodding sympathetically)\n\tWell, why don't you tell me what's going\n\ton?  Do you mind if I turn this on?\n\nHe indicates a tape recorder.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI don't care.\n\nHe turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWell, I've been having a bad time of it\n\twith um, my boyfriend, I guess.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tYou guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you\n\tguess you're having a bad time with hm?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWhat?  No.  I don't like the term\n\tboyfriend.  It's so gay.\n\nMierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral\nthroughout.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMaybe gay isn't the right word.  But,\n\tanyway, it's been rough with him...\n\twhatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My\n\tsignificant other... heh heh.  And I\n\tguess on a certain level, I want to break\n\tit off, but I feel... y'know... it's like\n\tthis constant questioning and re\n\tquestioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give\n\tit more time?  I'm not happy, but what do\n\tI expect?  Relationships require work.\n\tYou know the drill.  The thing that I\n\tkeep coming back to is, I'm not getting\n\tany younger, I want to have a baby... at\n\tsome point... maybe... right?  So then I\n\tthink I should settle -- which is not\n\tnecessarily the best word -- I mean, he's\n\ta good guy.  It's not really settling.\n\tThen I think maybe I'm just a victim of\n\tmovies, y'know?  That I have some\n\tcompletely unrealistic notion of what a\n\trelationship can be.  But then I think,\n\tno, this is what I really want, so I\n\tshould allow myself the freedom to go out\n\tand fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?\n\tBut then I think he is a good guy and...\n\tIt's complicated.  Y'know?\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tI think I know. I think we can help.  Why\n\tdon't you start by telling me about your\n\trelationship.  Everything you can think\n\tof.  Everything about him.  Everything\n\tabout you.  And we'll take it from there.\n\nShe nods, thinks.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tUm, well, he's a fucking tidy one --\n\n<b>EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION\n</b>\n<b>SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER\n</b>\nThe platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is\namong them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a\nbriefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.\nSuddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He\nclimbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty\nplatform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that\nplatform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters\nthrough the dirty window as his train pulls out of the\nstation.\n\n<b>EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER\n</b>\nJoel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries\nto shield the mouthpiece as he talks.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tHi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not\n\tfeeling well this morning.  No.  Food\n\tpoisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so\n\tlong to call in, but I've been vomiting.\n\n<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nJoel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He\npasses an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each\nother.\n\nLater: Joel looks out at the ocean.\n\nLater: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He\nopens it and writes with a gloved hand.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tJanuary 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work\n\tand took the train out to Montauk.\n\t\t(thinks)\n\tIt's cold.\n\t\t(thinks some more)\n\tThe sky is gray.\n\t\t(thinks some more)\n\tI don't know what else to say.  Nothing\n\thappens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi\n\tlast night.  We had sex.  It was weird to\n\tfall into our old familiar sex life so\n\teasily.  Like no time has passed.  After\n\ttwo years apart suddenly we're talking\n\tabout getting together again.  I guess\n\tthat's good.\n\nHe has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female\nfigure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands\nout against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded\nsweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then\nas she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least\npretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She\nstops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n</b>\tIf I'm constitutionally incapable of\n\tmaking eye-contact with a woman I don't\n\tknow.  I guess I'd better get back to\n\tNaomi.\n\nLater: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the\nseason.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.\n\nLater: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.\n\n<b>INT. DINER - DAY\n</b>\nIt's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits\nin a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of\ntomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.\nClementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel\nglances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth\nand sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress\napproaches her with a coffee pot.\n\n<b>\t\tWAITRESS\n</b>\tCoffee?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tGod, yes.  You've saved my life!\n\nThe waitress pours the coffee.\n\n<b>\t\tWAITRESS\n</b>\tYou know what you want yet?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(laughing)\n\tAin't that the question of the century.\n\nThe waitress is not amused.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYou got grilled cheese and tomato soup?\n\n<b>\t\tWAITRESS\n</b>\tYeah.  We're having a run on it.\n\nThe waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her\nbag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,\npours something in, then brings the cup back up.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(calling)\n\tAnd some cream, please.\n\nClementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's\nbefore he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He\nlooks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine\npulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances\nup, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the\ntitle.\n\n<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nJoel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine\nstares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at\nthe ocean.\n\n<b>EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nJoel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine\nenters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.\nShe waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if\nthey're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes\na seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his\nhands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to\nconceal his awkwardness.\n\n<b>INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER\n</b>\nJoel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the\nslowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door\nbetween cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.\nClementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding\nwhere to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of\nthe car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching\nhim.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(calling over the rumble)\n\tHi!\n\nJoel looks over.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI'm sorry.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWhy?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWhy what?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWhy are you sorry?  I just said hi.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo, I didn't know if you were talking to\n\tme, so...\n\nShe looks around the empty car.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tReally?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\t\t(embarrassed)\n\tWell, I didn't want to assume.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tAw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the\n\tleap and assume someone is talking to you\n\tin an otherwise empty car.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tAnyway.  Sorry.  Hi.\n\nClementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tIt's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't\n\thave to scream.  Not that I don't need to\n\tscream sometimes, believe me.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tBut I don't want to bug you if you're\n\ttrying to write or something.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really\n\tthink of much to say probably.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tOh.  So...\n\nShe hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she\ncame from.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI mean, it's okay if you want to sit down\n\there.  I didn't mean to --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNo, I don't want to bug you if you're\n\ttrying to --\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tIt's okay, really.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tJust, you know, to chat a little, maybe.\n\tI have a long trip ahead of me.\n\t\t(sits across aisle from Joel)\n\tHow far are you going?  On the train, I\n\tmean, of course.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tRockville Center.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tGet out!  Me too!  What are the odds?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThe weirder part is I think actually I\n\trecognize you.  I thought that earlier in\n\tthe diner.  That's why I was looking at\n\tyou.  You work at Borders, right?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tUcch, really?  You're kidding.  God.\n\tBizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's\n\tme: book slave there for, like, five\n\tyears now.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tReally?  Because --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tJesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit\n\tright now.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\t-- because I go there all the time.  I\n\tdon't think I ever saw you before.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWell, I'm there.  I hide in the back as\n\tmuch as is humanly possible.  You have a\n\tcell phone?  I need to quit right this\n\tminute.  I'll call in dead.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't have one.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy\n\tbefore me.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI noticed your hair.  I guess it made an\n\timpression on me, that's why I was pretty\n\tsure I recognized you.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tAh, the hair.\n\t\t(pulls a strand in front of her\n\t\t eyes, studies it)\n\tBlue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The\n\tcolor.  Snappy name, huh?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI like it.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tBlue ruin is cheap gin in case you were\n\twondering.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah.  Tom Waits says it in --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tExactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI can't remember.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tAnyway, this company makes a whole line\n\tof colors with equally snappy names.  Red\n\tMenace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.\n\tThat'd be a job, coming up with those\n\tnames.  How do you get a job like that?\n\tThat's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't really know how --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tPurple Haze, Pink Eraser.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYou think that could possibly be a full\n\ttime job?  How many hair colors could\n\tthere be?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(pissy)\n\tSomeone's got that job.\n\t\t(excited)\n\tAgent Orange!  I came up with that one.\n\tAnyway, there are endless color\n\tpossibilities and I'd be great at it.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI'm sure you would.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tMy writing career!  Your hair written by\n\tClementine Kruczynski.\n\t\t(thought)\n\tThe Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYou sure?  That doesn't sound --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI think.  Anyway, I've tried all their\n\tcolors.  More than once.  I'm getting too\n\told for this.  But it keeps me from\n\thaving to develop an actual personality.\n\tI apply my personality in a paste.  You?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOh, I doubt that's the case.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWell, you don't know me, so... you don't\n\tknow, do you?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSorry.  I was just trying to be nice.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYeah, I got it.\n\nThere's a silence.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMy name's Clementine, by the way.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI'm Joel.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNo jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't\n\tdo that; you're trying to be nice.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't know any jokes about your name.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tHuckleberry Hound?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't know what that means.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tHuckleberry Hound!

It's a pretty name, though.  It\n\tmeans \"merciful\", right?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(impressed)\n\tYeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a\n\tvindictive little bitch, truth be told.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSee, I wouldn't think that about you.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(pissy)\n\tWhy wouldn't you think that about me?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't\n\tknow.  I was... You seemed nice, so --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNow I'm nice?  Don't you know any other\n\tadjectives?  There's careless and snotty\n\tand overbearing and argumentative...\n\tmumpish.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWell, anyway... Sorry.\n\nThey sit in silence for a while.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI just don't think \"nice\" is a\n\tparticularly interesting thing to be.\n\nThe conductor enters the car.\n\n<b>\t\tCONDUCTOR\n</b>\tTickets.\n\nJoel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches\nit and hands it back.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWhat is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an\n\tadjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,\n\tsort of.\n\nThe conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tIt doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is\n\tpandering.

I don't need myself\n\tto be it and I don't need anyone else to\n\tbe it at me.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOkay.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tShit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.\n\nShe dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts\nfrantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in\nthe diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tDamn it.  DAMN IT!\n\t\t(there it is)\n\tOh.  Here.\n\nShe hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He\npunches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.\n\n<b>\t\tCONDUCTOR\n</b>\tNext stop Southampton.\n\nThe conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves\nstuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.\nShe pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,\nopens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but\npretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.\nThe train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody\ngets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tJoel?  It's Joel, right?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYes?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it\n\tyelling?  I can't really tell.

TRAIN - LATER\n</b>\nThere are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has\ninched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His\nhead is immersed in his journal.\n\n<b>INT. TRAIN - LATER\n</b>\nIt's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out\nthe window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.\n\n<b>EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING\n</b>\nThe doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads\nto the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented\nscrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.\n\n<b>INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nJoel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.\nHe considers, slows, rolls down his window.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tHi.  I could give you a ride if you need.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNo, that's okay.  Thanks, though.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYou're sure?

They drive.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWhere do you live?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou're not a stalker or anything, right?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWell, I probably wouldn't say if I were,\n\tbut no.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou can't be too careful.

It is Rain Dogs, by the way.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah?  I can't remember that album very\n\twell.  I remember liking it.  But --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tThe song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent\n\tmost of the train ride trying to\n\tremember.  \"Till you're full of rag water\n\tand bitters and blue ruin/And you spill\n\tout/Over the side to anyone who'll\n\tlisten.\"  Remember?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSort of, um...\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tRemember?  \"And you take on the dreams of\n\tthe ones who have slept there/And I'm\n\tlost in the window/I hide on the\n\tstairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in\n\tyour hat...\"\n\t\t(starts to cry)\n\tOh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI'm just a bit of a wreck.  \"I sleep in\n\tyour hat\" makes me cry.\n\t\t(pointing to a house)\n\tMe.\n\nJoel pulls over.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tThanks very much.

See Ya.\n\nClementine opens the car door.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tTake care.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(turning back)\n\tHey, do you want to have a drink?  I have\n\tlots of drinks.  And I could --\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tUm --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNever mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm\n\tembarrassed.  Good night, Joel.\n\n<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nJoel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries\nto calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at\nthe books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We\nsee her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing\ndrinks and chatting.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tThanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about\n\tfour years.  It's really cheap.  My\n\tdownstairs neighbor is old so she's\n\tquiet, which is great.  And the\n\tlandlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but\n\tgreat, and I have a little porch in the\n\tback, which is great, because I can read\n\tthere, and listen to my crickets and...\n\nClementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tTwo blue ruins...\n\nJoel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of\ncrows flying.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYou like that?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tVery much.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tThis... someone gave that to me, just\n\tlike, recently.  I like it, too.  I like\n\tcrows.  I think I used to be a crow.\n\nShe caws and hands Joel a drink.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThanks.  That was good, that crow sound.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tDo you believe in that stuff?\n\tReincarnation?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tMe neither.  Oh, there's an inscription\n\ton the back.\n\t\t(takes it off the wall, reads:)\n\tThe way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust\n\tof snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my\n\theart/A change of mood/And saved some\n\tpart/Of a day I rued.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tFrost?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(impressed)\n\tYeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost\n\tlover by any stretch.  His stuff seems\n\tstrictly grade school to me.  But this\n\tmade me cry for some reason.  Maybe\n\tbecause it is grade school.  Y'know?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tIt's pretty.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI miss grade school.  I don't know why\n\tI'm calling it grade school all of a\n\tsudden.  When I went we called it\n\telementary school.  But I like grade\n\tschool better.  Sounds like something\n\tsomeone from the forties would call it.\n\tI'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore\n\thats.  Anyway, cheers!\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tCheers.\n\nThey click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp\nof her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and\npulls her boots off.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tGod, that feels so fucking good.  Take\n\tyours off.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI'm fine.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.\n\nJoel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes\nher drink.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tReady for another?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo, I'm okay for now.\n\nShe heads toward the kitchen with her glass.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWell, I'm ready.  Put some music on.\n\nJoel crosses to the CD's and studies them.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWhat do you want to hear?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (O.S.)\n</b>\tYou pick it.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYou just say.  I'm not really --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (O.S.)\n</b>\tI don't know!  I can't see them from\n\there, Joel!  Just pick something good.\n\nJoel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can\nperforming Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.\nClementine reenters with her drink.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tOh, excellent choice.\n\nShe grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is\ndreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the\ncouch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick\n\tgood.\n\nJoel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,\nwhich seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWell, I should probably get going.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tNo, stay.  Just for a little while.\n\t\t(opens her eyes, brightly)\n\tRefill?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo.  I --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI know a man who needs a refill.\n\nShe grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the\nkitchen.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n</b>\tGod bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where\n\twould I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,\n\tand Joseph, maybe I don't want to think\n\tabout that.\n\nShe giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are\nseveral potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade\ncostumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher\npotato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's\ndrink and a refill for herself.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThanks.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tDrink up, young man.  It'll make the\n\twhole seduction part less repugnant.\n\nJoel looks a little alarmed.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI'm just kidding.  C'mon.\n\nShe sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches\nher, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles\ndrunkenly at him.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tY'know, I'm sort of psychic.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWell, I go to a psychic and she's always\n\ttelling me I'm psychic.  She should know.\n\tDo you believe in that stuff?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tMe neither.  But sometimes I have\n\tpremonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe\n\tthat's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,\n\tyou think something and then it happens,\n\tor you think a word and then someone says\n\tit?  Y'know?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tExactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my\n\tfeeling about it.  It's hard to know.\n\tLike, okay, but how many times do I think\n\tsomething and it doesn't happen?  That's\n\twhat you're saying, right?  You forget\n\tabout those times.  Right?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah, I guess.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(dreamy beat)\n\tBut I think I am.  I like to think I am.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tIt's helpful to think there's some order\n\tto things.  You're kind of closed\n\tmouthed, aren't you?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSorry.  My life isn't that interesting.\n\tI go to work.  I go home.  I don't know\n\twhat to say.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tOh.\n\t\t(considers this)\n\tDoes that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm\n\talways anxious thinking I'm not living my\n\tlife to the fullest, y'know?  Taking\n\tadvantage of every possibility?  Just\n\tmaking sure that I'm not wasting one\n\tsecond of the little time I have.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI think about that.\n\nShe looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries\nto hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.\nClementine starts to cry again.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled\n\tat you before about it.  God, I'm an\n\tidiot.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI do have a tendency to use that word too\n\tmuch.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI like you.  That's the thing about my\n\tpsychic thing.  I think that's my\n\tgreatest psychic power, that I get a\n\tsense about people.  My problem is I\n\tnever trust it.  But I get it.  And with\n\tyou I get that you're a really good guy.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThanks.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tAnd, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I\n\tcan tell.  There's a lot of stuff going\n\ton in your brain.  I can tell.  My\n\tgoal... can I tell you my goal?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(ala Paul Simon)\n\tWhat's the goal, Joel?\n\t\t(laughs)\n\tMy goal, Joel, is to just let it flow\n\tthrough me?  Do you know what I mean?\n\tIt's like, there's all these emotions and\n\tideas and they come quick and they change\n\tand they leave and they come back in a\n\tdifferent form and I think we're all\n\ttaught we should be consistent.  Y'know?\n\tYou love someone -- that's it.  Forever.\n\tYou choose to do something with your life\n\t-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a\n\tsign of maturity to stick with that and\n\tsee things through.  And my feeling is\n\tthat's how you die, because you stop\n\tlistening to what is true, and what is\n\ttrue is constantly changing.  You know?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tLike I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't\n\tneed any more reason to do it.  Who knows\n\twhat bigger cosmic reason might exist?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou're very nice.  God, I have to stop\n\tsaying that.  You're nervous around me,\n\thuh?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI'm nervous.  You don't need to be\n\tnervous around me, though.  I like you.\n\tDo you think I'm repulsively fat?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tNo, not at all.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI don't either.  I used to.  But I'm\n\tthrough with that.  Y'know, if I don't\n\tlove my body, then I'm just lost.  You\n\tknow?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWith all the wrinkles and scars and the\n\tgeneral falling apart that's coming\n\t'round the bend.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tSo, I've been seeing this guy...\n\nJoel looks slightly crestfallen.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(off his reaction)\n\tWell, for the last week, anyway!  He's\n\tkind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but\n\the's really stuck on me, which is\n\tflattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And\n\the's, like, a dope, but he says these\n\tsmart and moving things sometimes, out of\n\tnowhere, that just break my heart.  He's\n\tthe one who gave me that crow photograph.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOh, yeah.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tThat made me cry.  But, anyway, we went\n\tup to Boston, because I had this urge to\n\tlie on my back on the Charles River.  It\n\tgets frozen this time of year.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThat's scary sounding.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tExactly!  I used to do it in college and\n\tI had this urge to go do it again, so I\n\tgot Patrick and we drove all night to get\n\tthere and he was sweet and said nice\n\tthings to me, but I was really\n\tdisappointment to be there with him.\n\tY'know?  And that's where psychic stuff\n\tcomes in.  Like, it just isn't right with\n\thim.  Y'know?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI think so.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI don't believe in that soulmate crap\n\tanymore, but... he says so many great\n\tthings.  We like the same writers.  This\n\twriter Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.\n\tAnd he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,\n\tyou should come up to the Charles with me\n\tsometime.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOkay.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYeah?  Oh, great!\n\nShe sits closer to him.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --\n\tnight picnics are different -- and --\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\t\t(shy)\n\tSounds good.  But right now I should go.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(pause)\n\tYou should stay.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI have to get up early in the morning\n\ttomorrow, so...\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\t\t(beat)\n\tOkay.\n\nJoel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone\ntable, pulls out a notepad.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI would like you to call me.  Would you\n\tdo that?  I would like that.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYes.\n\nShe scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it\nin his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,\nthen forces himself to speak.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI don't think your personality comes out\n\tof a tube.  I think the hair is just... a\n\tpretty topping.\n\nShe tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's\nsurprised and pleased and nervous.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(shyly formal)\n\tSo, I enjoyed meeting you.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou'll call me, right?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYeah.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWhen?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tTomorrow?\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tTonight.  Just to test out the phone\n\tlines and all.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tOkay.\n\nWe stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through\nthe snow and getting in his car.\n\n<b>INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nJoel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center\nneighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems\ndifferent, somehow foggy and disoriented.\n\n<b>SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER\n</b>\nHe arrives at his apartment building and parks.\n\n<b>EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nJoel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the\nstreet.  There are two dark figures inside.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tThem.\n\nHe hurries inside the building.\n\n<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nJoel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the\nlights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's\nsnowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam\nof a streetlight.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tIt was snowing.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tThere are two of them.  Couldn't make\n\tthem out.  The orange glow of a\n\tcigarette.\n\nJoel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.\nOne sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily\nilluminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat\nrolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tThe driver waved.  So casual, friendly.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tI'm like a joke to them.\n\nJoel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tI guess they figure they can act like\n\tthey want.  They don't have to worry\n\tabout me remembering.\n\nHe paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts\nto change, almost as if it is drying out.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI might be making a mistake.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tMaybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just\n\tneed to learn to live with this.  First\n\tof all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it\n\thappened.  Those who do not remember\n\thistory are condemned to repeat it.  Who\n\tsaid that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.\n\tBut I don't care.  She did it to me.  I\n\thave to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tFuck you, Clementine.\n\nThe colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.\nEven Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his\nemotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem\naware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his\npocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.\nIt's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tPink.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tThere was a number on it.  I remember.\n<b>\tAL 1718?\n</b>\t\t(beat)\n\tI have to follow through with this.  I\n\thave no choice.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tThe pill was pink, I remember.  It had\n\tsome letters and numbers on it.  What\n\twere they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four\n\tdigits.  I don't like taking pills when I\n\tdon't know what they are.  I have no\n\tchoice.\n\nHe swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his\nclothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store\npackaging.

It's a jarring\ntransition, visually and emotionally.

Joel stops, watches.  The young man\nseems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps\nClementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it\nis and her face lights up.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tClementine.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE-OVER\n</b>\tThat's your look for me.\n\nClementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the\nribs.\n\n<b>\t\tPATRICK\n</b>\tI just thought I'd say hi.

The equipment registers Joel's reaction.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tVery good.\n\nStan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel\nstudies it.

Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.\n\n<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nJoel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed\nand electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The\nmachines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes\nand in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.\nThe monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light\nblips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.\nStan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the\nlines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the\nbookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.\n\n<b>\t\tPATRICK\n</b>\tThe voltage looks fine.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tThen check the connections.\n\nPatrick fiddles with some jacks.\n\n<b>\t\tPATRICK\n</b>\tDoes that help?\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tYeah, that looks better.

JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\nJoel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large\nplastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with\nClementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some\npotatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left\nthere, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his\nloose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.\n\nHe gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:\n\nDecember 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed\nhome.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.\n\nThe scene is fading as he continues to write.\n\n<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nJoel looks for an office number.  He finds it.

Get up, faggot.  C'mon.\n\nJoel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at\nClementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her\neye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI'm too scared to even throw a punch.\n\tWhen I tell people this story I leave\n\tthat part out.\n\nThe scene flashes violently to white and is gone.\n\n<b>INT.

He grabs her and\nruns through the decaying scene and into the vague night.\n\n<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nJoel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer\nand is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other\nboys are goading him.\n\n<b>\t\tBOYS\n</b>\tC'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.\n\nJoel doesn't want to.

If that means anything.\n\nThey look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back\nto locating and eradicating blips of lights.\n\n<b>EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n</b>\nStan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an\nunobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches\nMierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It\nappears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up\noutside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,\nchecks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only\nlit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's\nresolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.\nThis time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and\nfalling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The\nwoman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to\nunzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.\nHe practically shrieks and jumps up.\n\n<b>EXT.

Sorry, man.\n\t\t(reading)\n\tSays you were jealous and suspicious.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSays you would sometimes disappear all\n\tnight, then brag to me about your sexual\n\tconquests.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tDid I use the term \"sexual conquests\" or\n\tis that your way of putting it.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tDoesn't sound like me.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tSays you were a slob, leaving trails of\n\tpanties and dirty socks in your wake.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tSays you were constantly calling me a\n\tslob.\n\t\t(laughs)\n\tIt's sexy that we were like a married\n\tcouple, griping and overly-familiar and\n\tbored.  Don't you think?\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\t\t(considering)\n\tI sort of do.  But I only see it as a\n\tfantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up\n\tenough to be erotic.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tWe should have sex.  It's old hat for us.\n\nShe smiles at nervous Joel.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYou know my body like the back of your\n\thand.\n\nShe unbuttons her blouse.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tEvery curve, every freckle.\n\nShe takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly\nnever seen this body before.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tYou're so beautiful.\n\nShe approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her\nwaist for the first time.\n\n<b>INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING\n</b>\nStan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding\ntheir files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in\nthe reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\tMay I help you?\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tI work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.\n\tPlease just tell Howard I'm here to clean\n\tout my desk.\n\n<b>\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\t\t(into phone)\n\tMr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes\n\tsir.\n\t\t(to Stan)\n\tHe says he needs to see you.\n\n<b>INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nStan enters.  Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tShe should not have done this, Stan.  As\n\tmad as she was... as justifiably --\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tI don't know what you're talking about,\n\tHoward.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tMary has stolen our files and is sending\n\tthem back to people.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tJesus.\n\nMierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor\nlooking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over\nStan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad\nyoung woman.\n\n<b>\t\tYOUNG WOMAN\n</b>\t... so I called everybody I know and\n\tasked them to tell me everything.  Now I\n\tknow my entire history with him, but it's\n\tin the form of a story, I'm losing my\n\tmind.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tThis is why people must never be told.\n\tIt's like waking a --\n\n<b>\t\tYOUNG WOMAN\n</b>\tI don't know what to do.  Before I\n\tthought I was depressed for no reason.\n\tNow it's like I've been assigned a\n\treason.\n\n<b>\t\tPATRICK\n</b>\tThis never should've happened, ma'am.\n\tWe'll take care of it.\n\n<b>\t\tMIERZWIAK\n</b>\tI know you don't like me much, Stan, but\n\tplease talk to Mary.  She of all people\n\tshould know this is a dangerous thing\n\tshe's doing.\n\n<b>INT. OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nJoel works over his light box.  His phone rings.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tHi, it's Joel.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE'S VOICE\n</b>\tHey, lover.

Panties and --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE'S VOICE\n</b>\tYour dried cum.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tJesus.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYou're still excited by my irreverence.\n\tYou haven't yet started to think of it as\n\tmy \"gratuitous need to shock.\"\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tI can't stop thinking about you.\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tYay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.\n\n<b>\t\tJOEL\n</b>\tWhat old mill?  Is that somewhere we --\n\n<b>\t\tCLEMENTINE\n</b>\tI just wanted to say that.  Come by my\n\thouse.\n\n<b>INT.

He does, looks around,\nsees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWhat's this?\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tNothing.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tI know what it is.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tThen why did you ask me?\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tI don't know.  I just -- there are a lot\n\tof really confused people showing up at\n\tthe office.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tThey have a right to know.  Howard is a\n\tthief.  He steals the truth.\n\t\t(suddenly weeping)\n\tI can't remember my baby!  I can't\n\tremember my baby.  It existed and I can't\n\teven remember.  Do you understand that?\n\nStan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary\nslumps into a ball on a chair.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tMary, people come to him voluntarily.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tI won't allow it.  Those who cannot\n\tremember the past are condemned to repeat\n\tit.  What do you think of that?  That's\n\tfrom my quote book.\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tThe office is filled with people who want\n\ttheir memories re-erased.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(hysterically)\n\tRemember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!\n\n<b>\t\tSTAN\n</b>\tMary... please.  This is hurting people.\n\nLong pause, then:\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\t\t(small)\n\tI don't want to hurt people.\n\t\t(breaking down)\n\tBut these things happened!  All these\n\tlittle sadnesses, the big ones.  What if\n\tno one remembers?  What does that do to\n\tthe world?\n\t\t(beat, quietly)\n\tSomeone has to remember, Stan.\n\nThey look at each other.\n\n<b>EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nVague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.\n\n<b>\t\tSAD WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>\tI was by myself in the park because my\n\tfriend Davia was sick that day.  I was on\n\ta swing.  There was this smiling man\n\twalking a little bushy dog --\n\nVague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.\n\n<b>\t\tSAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tThe man said something like, \"He's\n\tfriendly --\"\n\nVague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the\nwoman's.\n\n<b>\t\tSAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\"-- he won't bite.\"\n\n<b>\t\tMAN\n</b>\tHe won't bite.

She has been crying.  There's a pile of tapes\nnext to her.  The distraught woman is standing there.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tMay I help you?\n\n<b>\t\tDISTRAUGHT WOMAN\n</b>\tI'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is\n\tHelene Kernfeld.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY\n</b>\tYes, please have a seat.  The doctor will\n\tbe with you momentarily.\n\nThe woman sits.  Mary presses an intercom button.\n\n<b>\t\tMARY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHoward, your 10:30.\n\nShe switches the tape back on.\n\n<b>\t\tSAD WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>\tHe took me to his car and ...\n\nVague shot of the girl being raped.\n\n<b>INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY\n</b>\nThe old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in\nher lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move\ninto her eyes.\n\n<b>INT. VAGUE SPACE\n</b>\nVague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined\nspace:\n\nThe young girl being raped by the man in the car.\n\nA soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered\nfriends.\n\nA couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.\n\n<b>\t\tMAN\n</b>\tI...I...

COMMUTER TUBE - DAY\n</b>\nThe old woman and her chair lift out of the line of\ncommuters.\n\n<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nIt's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits\nbehind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the\ndrawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man\nenters.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\tHow are you today, Mary?\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN (MARY)\n</b>\tLet's see... Still dying, Howard.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN (HOWARD)\n</b>\tYou don't have to jump down my throat.  I\n\twas trying to be nice.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN (MARY)\n</b>\tWell, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.\n\nOld Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.\nOld Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,\nplaces it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and\nlistens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the\ncolor drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.\nAnother old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,\nseems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMay I help you?\n\n<b>\t\tSECOND OLD WOMAN\n</b>\tI'd like to make an appointment.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN (MARY)\n</b>\tI think the doctor is free this morning.\n\tHe can probably take you right away for\n\tan initial consultation.\n\nThe second old woman smiles gratefully.\n\n<b>INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nOld Howard works at his desk.  Old Mary enters with the\nsecond old woman.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD WOMAN (MARY)\n</b>\tDr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine\n\tKruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.\n\nOld Howard and the old Mary eye each other.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN (HOWARD)\n</b>\tHello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.\n\tPlease have a seat.\n\nHe indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWould you mind if I tape our discussion?\n\nShe shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his\ncomputer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer\nscreen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole\nfile on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of\nprevious erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them\ninvolving Joel Barish.\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)\n</b>\tSo, why don't you begin by telling me why\n\tyou've come here.\n\n<b>\t\tSECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)\n</b>\tWell, I met this man, Joel, three years\n\tago at a senior dance...  We'd both been\n\talone for so long and...\n\n<b>INT. TUBE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over\nManhattan.  It's late, the tube is mostly empty.  She has\nearphones on.\n\n<b>\t\tSECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)\n</b>\tI remember Joel and I were having\n\tbreakfast --\n\n<b>INT.

The\nwoman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.\n\n<b>\t\tSECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)\n</b><b>\t\t(CONT'D)\n</b>\tHe just stared at me as if I didn't\n\texist.  As if I had never existed...\n\n<b>INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nThe second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on\nin the distance.  The old woman with the earphones is dead,\nher eyes glassy and unseeing.\n\n<b>\t\tSECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)\n</b>\t-- his eyes used to be so filled with\n\tlove.  But it was gone.  How can I go\n\tback to being alone after seeing love?  I\n\twas alone for so long.  What had I done\n\twith my life?  I was alone so long.\n\n<b>INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to\nmodern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young\ntechnicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone\nrings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:\n\n<b>\t\tOLD MAN'S VOICE\n</b>\tHi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?\n\tWhy won't you call me back?  Please call\n\tme.
