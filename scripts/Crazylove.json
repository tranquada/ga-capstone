BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY\n          \n          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a\n          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.\n          \n          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze\n          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.\n          \n          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the\n          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the \"William Tell Overture.\" Toes,\n          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.\n          \n          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.\n          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are\n          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the\n          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty\n          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her\n          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.\n          \n          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen\n          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the\n          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off\n          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.\n          \n                               LETTY\n                     Listen, Beast. What have I told\n                     you about linen?\n          \n          The scolding is cut short by an \"Urge Overkill\" song that\n          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the\n          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN - SAME\n          \n          Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS \"Urge Overkill\"\n          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.\n          \n          She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food\n          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the\n          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.\n          \n                               LETTY\n                         (looking at Beast)\n                     It's liver saute.\n          \n          Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.\n          \n                               LETTY\n          \n                     Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But\n                     you're going to have to eat the\n                     liver tomorrow.\n          \n                                                                      2.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. BATHROOM - SAME\n          \n          Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls\n          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair\n          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the\n          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.\n          \n          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME\n          \n          Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is\n          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat\n          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.\n          \n          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY\n          \n          A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch\n          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.\n          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to\n          turn the handle.\n          \n          Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody\n          nose, runs up to her, bawling.\n          \n                              CHANDRA\n                    Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.\n          \n          Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.\n          \n                              LETTY\n                        (to Chandra)\n                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip\n                    your head back.\n          \n          She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off\n          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,\n          staining it for all eternity.\n          \n          Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and\n          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.\n          \n                              LETTY\n                    Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch\n                    it.\n          \n          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER\n          \n          PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with\n          BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also\n          present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and\n          two other BOARD MEMBERS.\n          \n          Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her\n          foot. Johansen clears his throat.\n          \n                                                                     3.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JOHANSEN\n                    Well, I have a full calendar today,\n                    and I'm afraid...\n          \n          The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She\n          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her\n          blood-smeared lapel.\n          \n                              LETTY\n                    Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry\n                    I'm late. It's very nice to meet\n                    you.\n          \n          Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending\n          down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.\n          \n                              PRINCIPAL GAIL\n                    The Superintendent was just getting\n                    ready to leave.\n          \n                              LETTY\n                    I do apologize.    A student had a\n                    crisis.\n          \n                              MRS. MONTES\n                    A crisis, you say?\n          \n                              LETTY\n                    A bloody nose...\n          \n          There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase\n          and reveals the stain.\n          \n                              LETTY\n                    A bloody nose of epic proportions.\n          \n          Johansen smiles.\n          \n                              JOHANSEN\n                    OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow\n                    us.\n          \n          EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER\n          \n          A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra\n          sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a\n          limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.\n          \n          Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor\n          her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball\n          game.\n          \n                                                                   4.\n          \n          \n          \n                               LETTY\n                    No cherry drops, Jenny.\n                        (into the phone)\n                    Yes, hi.

She sees two boys fighting over the ball\n          and moves in to break them up.\n          \n                               LETTY\n                        (to boys)\n                    Not so rough, guys.\n                        (into phone)\n                    Mom?

How about dinner?\n          \n          Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches\n          Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She\n          blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.\n          \n                               LETTY\n                        (to Jenny)\n                    You're in trouble, young lady.\n                        (into the phone)\n                    I know, Mom.

The monsters call.\n          \n          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n          \n          Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the\n          patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping\n          wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a\n          cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.\n          \n                                                                   5.\n          \n          \n          \n          Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair\n          and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing\n          happiness.
