Winter rain slices the air.         \r\n     Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest        \r\n     of tall masted warships.                                            \r\n\r\n     The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their            \r\n     rigging.                                                            \r\n\r\n     Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships             \r\n     under construction, and warships being refitted.                    \r\n\r\n     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:                                                \r\n\r\n               Toulon                                                    \r\n               Home port of the French navy                              \r\n\r\n\r\n1    EXT.

As it recedes we see the figures of men\r\n     heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over           \r\n     their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:\r\n     these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,          \r\n     wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched             \r\n     onto them.                                                          \r\n\r\n     Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being            \r\n     hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts\r\n     broken, rising and falling on the surge.\r\n\r\n     As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we\r\n     follow the straining ropes down into the base of the                \r\n     slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist         \r\n     in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and          \r\n     spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he         \r\n     seems to feel nothing.                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                         \r\n                                                      2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the\r\nrope -\r\n\r\n                      CONVICTS\r\n          Ha - Ha -\r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 3                                   \r\n          Ha - Ha -\r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          Don't look them in the eye                            \r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS                                    \r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          You're here until you die.\r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 4                                   \r\n          No God above\r\n          And Hell alone below\r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS                                    \r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          There's twenty years to go.\r\n\r\nThe camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge       \r\nof the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed      \r\nand expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of\r\nthe dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the\r\nsteep steps of the dock wall.\r\n\r\nBehind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of   \r\nhalf-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in   \r\nthe mist.                                                       \r\n\r\nFOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is\r\nalmost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.\r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 2                                   \r\n          I've done no wrong\r\n          Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!\r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS\r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          Sweet Jesus doesn't care.\r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 5                                   \r\n          I know she'll wait\r\n          I know that she'll be true -\r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS\r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          They've all forgotten you.                            \r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 1                                   \r\n          When I get free\r\n          You won't see me\r\n          Here for dust!\r\n                                                         3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS\r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          Don't look'em in the eye.\r\n\r\n                    CONVICT 3                                     \r\n          How long, O Lord\r\n          Before you let me die?\r\n\r\n                    CONVICTS                                      \r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          You'll always be a slave.\r\n          Look down, look down\r\n          You're standing in your grave.\r\n\r\nWith a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the            \r\ndamaged ship onto the slipway.                                    \r\n\r\nCRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust     \r\nof wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.     \r\nJavert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent             \r\ncommand. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he     \r\ndrops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the        \r\ngreat mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks      \r\nwater with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the      \r\nmast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.                  \r\n\r\nJavert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the\r\nchained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm\r\nis passing now, blown by the driving wind.\r\n\r\nJavert approaches Jean Valjean.                                   \r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Now Prisoner 24601.                                     \r\n          Your time is up\r\n          And your parole's begun.\r\n          You know what that means?                               \r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Yes.

Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in            \r\n    that he is free at last.\r\n\r\n    The convicts sing as he goes.                                       \r\n\r\n                        CONVICTS\r\n              Look down, look down\r\n              You'll always be a slave.\r\n              Look down, look down\r\n              You're standing in your grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   EXT.

He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and\r\n    there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide\r\n    vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the\r\n    distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and\r\n    below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge.

The officer fastidiously writes down        \r\n     the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the          \r\n     town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the              \r\n     passport.                                                           \r\n\r\n                          OFFICER                                        \r\n               Valjean.                                                  \r\n\r\n     The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.                \r\n\r\n\r\n6C   EXT. DIGNE - DUSK                                            6C\r\n\r\n     Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an\r\n     inn and enters.\r\n\r\n\r\n7    INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK                                7\r\n\r\n     Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He\r\n     eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast\r\n     meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a\r\n     beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to\r\n     reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The\r\n     innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two\r\n     other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase\r\n     \"Extremely Dangerous\".                                              \r\n\r\n     VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's\r\n     hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of\r\n     refusal.\r\n\r\n                         INNKEEPER\r\n               My inn is full.\r\n\r\n\r\n7A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           7A\r\n\r\n     Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes\r\n     down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,\r\n     but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure\r\n     follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.\r\n\r\n     Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a\r\n     stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his\r\n     heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife\r\n     before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,\r\n     and yet everything he's never had.\r\n\r\n\r\n8    EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT                                    8\r\n\r\n     He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell\r\n     hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.\r\n                                                           7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               Jailer. Would you let me stay here                        \r\n               for tonight?\r\n\r\n                         JAILER                                          \r\n               This is a prison, not an inn. Get\r\n               yourself arrested. Then we will\r\n               open up for you.\r\n\r\n     The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some\r\n     children who have been following begin throwing stones at\r\n     him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n8A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8A\r\n\r\n     He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.         \r\n     Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some            \r\n     straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an\r\n     enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.\r\n\r\n\r\n8B   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8B\r\n\r\n     Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,\r\n     weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from\r\n     where the dog has bitten him.\r\n\r\n     At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a\r\n     dark churchyard.                                                    \r\n\r\n\r\n9    EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT                               9\r\n\r\n     Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean\r\n     collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the\r\n     shelter of a doorway.                                               \r\n\r\n     A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,\r\n     throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest\r\n     on the crumpled figure of Valjean.\r\n\r\n     He stirs and opens his eyes.\r\n\r\n     VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.\r\n     Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The            \r\n     BISHOP.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               Come in, sir, for you are weary\r\n               And the night is cold out here.\r\n               Though our lives are very humble\r\n               What we have we have to share.\r\n\r\n     Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes\r\n     with the Bishop into the house by the church.                       \r\n                                                           8.\r\n\r\n\r\n10   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                10     \r\n\r\n     A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with          \r\n     silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,           \r\n     illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop      \r\n     ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's         \r\n     sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.               \r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               There is wine here to revive you.\r\n               There is bread to make you\r\n               strong.\r\n               There's a bed to rest till\r\n               morning -\r\n               Rest from pain, and rest from\r\n               wrong.                                                  \r\n\r\n                         BISHOP                                        \r\n               Sit, my brother.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               Madame, set one more place.\r\n                   (to Valjean)\r\n               Please sit.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.\r\n\r\n     Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.\r\n     Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a\r\n     short grace.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               May the Lord bless the food we eat                      \r\n               today. Bless our dear sister and                        \r\n               our honoured guest.\r\n                   (To Valjean)\r\n               Please, eat. Where are you\r\n               travelling to my brother?\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               Pontarlier.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               Is that where your family is?\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               No. The destination is compulsory.\r\n               That is where the Law sends me. I\r\n               have no home.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               Then let this be your home, for\r\n               as long as you need it.\r\n                                                              9.\r\n\r\n\r\n11   INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          11\r\n\r\n     The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are\r\n     also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,\r\n     Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.\r\n     There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a\r\n     cupboard.\r\n\r\n     He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen\r\n     waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his\r\n     life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               Sleep well. Tomorrow morning\r\n               before you leave you will have a\r\n               cup of milk from our cows, nice\r\n               and hot.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               You let me sleep here next to you?\r\n               How do you know I'm not a murderer?\r\n\r\n     Valjean laughs a strange laugh.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n               God will take care of that.\r\n\r\n     LATER THAT NIGHT -\r\n\r\n     Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.\r\n\r\n     Outside a dog barks.\r\n\r\n     Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the\r\n     light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down\r\n     on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing\r\n     judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and\r\n     remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.\r\n\r\n     There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to\r\n     the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop\r\n     lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver\r\n     is kept.\r\n\r\n     Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a             \r\n     metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor           \r\n     boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his\r\n     breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.\r\n     He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard          \r\n     door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,                  \r\n     disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is\r\n     over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should          \r\n     he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and\r\n     lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.\r\n     He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is\r\n     the silver.\r\n                                                          10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last         \r\n     look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the\r\n     door.\r\n\r\n\r\n12   EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT                                      12     \r\n\r\n     Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He                \r\n     crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's         \r\n     gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY                                    13     \r\n\r\n     The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments          \r\n     when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean\r\n     before him.

He's sure he recognises Valjean, but\r\n     from where?\r\n\r\n                           JAVERT\r\n                 It seems to me\r\n                 We may have met.\r\n\r\n     Valjean throws him a sharp glance.\r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN\r\n                 Your face is not a face\r\n                 I would forget.\r\n\r\n     A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -\r\n\r\n\r\n24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24\r\n\r\n     Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and\r\n     down the muddy track beyond to discover -\r\n\r\n     A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -             \r\n     Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a\r\n     crate.\r\n\r\n     The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart\r\n     off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is\r\n     too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in\r\n     the   mud.\r\n\r\n     Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,\r\n     but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.\r\n     All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing\r\n     Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.\r\n     Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart\r\n     have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws\r\n     himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces\r\n     himself to lift it from beneath.\r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN\r\n                 Get back! It may fall!\r\n\r\n                           FOREMAN\r\n                 No, Monsieur le Mayor!\r\n\r\n                           CROWD\r\n                 It'll kill you as well!\r\n                                                     21.\r\n\r\n\r\nJavert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a\r\nmemory stirring in him.\r\n\r\nJAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is\r\nexactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.\r\nThe same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nValjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what\r\nhe's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears\r\nFauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.\r\nValjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the\r\ncart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and\r\ngasping man, the others pull him clear.\r\n\r\nValjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he\r\nbrushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Can this be true?\r\n          I don't believe what I see!\r\n          A man your age\r\n          To be as strong as you are!\r\n          A memory stirs...                                    \r\n          You make me think of a man                           \r\n          From years ago                                       \r\n          A man who broke his parole..                         \r\n          He disappeared.                                      \r\n\r\nHe shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions\r\nare.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Forgive me, sir.\r\n          I would not dare -\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Say what you must.\r\n          Don't leave it there.\r\n\r\nValjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.      \r\nJavert is not yet confident enough to continue.                \r\n\r\nValjean goes to help Fauchelevent.                             \r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN                                    \r\n          Let me help you up.                                  \r\n\r\nFauchelevent groans as he rises.                               \r\n\r\n                    FAUCHELEVENT\r\n          Monsieur le Mayor, you come from\r\n          God!\r\n          You are a saint!\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN                                    \r\n          No more cart driving for you!                        \r\n                                                             22.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Javert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion.\r\n\r\n                         JAVERT\r\n               Monsieur le Mayor.\r\n\r\n     He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he            \r\n     discusses something with his assistant.                              \r\n\r\n\r\n25   EXT.

RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26\r\n\r\n     Fantine makes her way down   wet slimy steps. This leads to an       \r\n     alleyway that runs down to   the harbour and three ships lying       \r\n     on the mud at low tide. At   the far end, the largest is the         \r\n     rotting hulk of a vast old   warship. A single whore sits in a       \r\n     doorway.                                                             \r\n\r\n                         FANTINE                                          \r\n               Excuse me, is this where the                               \r\n               Pawnbrokers is?                                            \r\n\r\n                         WHORE 1                                          \r\n                   (pointing)                                             \r\n               It's just there.                                           \r\n\r\n                            FANTINE                                       \r\n               Thank you.                                                 \r\n\r\n     Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below.

Fantine presses   \r\n     on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.                \r\n\r\n                         SAILOR 2\r\n               Lovely ladies!                                             \r\n               Love `em till your broke!                                  \r\n               Seven months at sea can make you\r\n               Hungry for a poke!\r\n\r\n     The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows         \r\n     of warehouse doorways.                                               \r\n\r\n                         SAILOR 3\r\n               Even stokers need a little stoke!\r\n                                                        23.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an        \r\norgan-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows             \r\nharbour whores appear and tout for business.                     \r\n\r\nA man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear            \r\nfragments of his sales pitch.                                    \r\n\r\n            WHORES                         TOOTH MAN\r\nLovely ladies                   Lovely dentures\r\nWaiting for a bite!

She draws her legs up and wraps her arms\r\n     round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world.\r\n\r\n                         FANTINE\r\n               There was a time when men were\r\n               kind,\r\n               When their voices were soft\r\n               And their words inviting.\r\n               There was a time when love was\r\n               blind\r\n               And the world was a song\r\n               And the song was exciting.\r\n               There was a time...\r\n               Then it all went wrong.\r\n\r\n               I dreamed a dream in time gone\r\n               by,\r\n               When hope was high\r\n               And life worth living.\r\n               I dreamed that love would never\r\n               die.\r\n               I dreamed that God would be\r\n               forgiving.\r\n                          (more)\r\n                                                          29.\r\n\r\n                         FANTINE (cont'd)\r\n\r\n               Then I was young and unafraid\r\n               And dreams were made and used and\r\n               wasted.\r\n               There was no ransom to be paid,\r\n               No song unsung, no wine untasted.\r\n\r\n               But the tigers come at night\r\n               With their voices soft as thunder\r\n               As they tear your hope apart\r\n               As they turn your dream to shame.\r\n\r\n               He slept a summer by my side,\r\n               He filled my days with endless\r\n               wonder.\r\n               He took my childhood in his\r\n               stride\r\n               But he was gone when autumn came.\r\n\r\n               And still I dream he'll come to\r\n               me!\r\n               That we will live the years\r\n               together...\r\n               But there are dreams that cannot\r\n               be\r\n               And there are storms we cannot\r\n               weather...\r\n\r\n               I had a dream my life would be\r\n               So different from this hell I'm\r\n               living -\r\n               So different now from what it\r\n               seemed!\r\n               Now life has killed the dream I\r\n               dreamed.\r\n\r\n     As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head      \r\n     whore beyond.                                                     \r\n\r\n\r\n29   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                 29\r\n\r\n     Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside,              \r\n     shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly,\r\n     but still attempts an alluring smile.\r\n\r\n     She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits,\r\n     trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a\r\n     stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some\r\n     way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to       \r\n     a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.           \r\n\r\n     As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-\r\n     dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives        \r\n     with two friends and a valet.                                     \r\n                                                     30.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n          Here's something new. I think\r\n          I'll give it a try.\r\n          Come closer, you! I like to see\r\n          what I buy.\r\n          The usual price\r\n          For just one slice of your pie.                       \r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          I don't want you! No! No,\r\n          M'sieur! Let me go!\r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n          Is this a trick? I won't pay\r\n          more!\r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          No, not at all!                                       \r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n          You've got some nerve, you little\r\n          slut!\r\n          You've got some gall!                                 \r\n          It's the same with a tart as it is                    \r\n          with a grocer                                         \r\n          The customer sees what he gets in                     \r\n          advance                                               \r\n          It's not for the whore to say \"yes                    \r\n          sir\" or \"no sir\"                                      \r\n          It's not for the harlot to pick and                   \r\n          to choose or to lead me a dance!                      \r\n\r\nHe pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down      \r\nher cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the   \r\nsnow and Bamatabois laughs.                                     \r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          I'll kill you, you bastard!\r\n          Try any of that!\r\n          Even a whore who has gone to the\r\n          bad\r\n          Won't be had by a rat!                                \r\n\r\nFantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois        \r\ntouches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His         \r\nfriends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.                  \r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n              (furious but aroused)                             \r\n          By Christ you'll pay for what\r\n          you've done!\r\n          This rat will make you bleed,\r\n          you'll see!\r\n          I guarantee I'll make you suffer!\r\n          For this disturbance of the peace\r\n          For this insult to life and\r\n          property!\r\n                                                     31.\r\n\r\n\r\nBamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.            \r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          I beg you, don't report me, sir.\r\n          I'll do whatever you may want.                      \r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n          Make your excuse to the police!\r\n\r\nBamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's     \r\nJavert.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Tell me quickly what's the story.\r\n          Who saw what and why and where?\r\n          Let him give a full description,\r\n          Let him answer to Javert!\r\n          In this nest of whores and vipers\r\n          Let one speak who saw it all.\r\n          Who laid hands on this good man\r\n          here?\r\n          What's the substance of this\r\n          brawl?\r\n\r\n                    BAMATABOIS\r\n          Javert, would you believe it?                       \r\n          I was walking, it was dark\r\n          When this prostitute attacked me\r\n          You can see she's left her mark!\r\n\r\nHe shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          She will answer for her actions\r\n          When you make a full report.\r\n          You may rest assured, M'sieur,\r\n          That she will answer to the\r\n          court.\r\n\r\nFantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with\r\noccasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is\r\napproaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine     \r\nup. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he         \r\napproaches Fantine.                                           \r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          There's a child who sorely needs\r\n          me,\r\n          Please, m'sieur, she's but that\r\n          high.\r\n          Holy God, is there no mercy?\r\n          If I go to jail she'll die.                         \r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          I have heard such protestations\r\n          Every day for twenty years.\r\n          Let's have no more explanations,\r\n                    (more)\r\n                                                     32.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT (cont'd)\r\n          Save your breath and save your\r\n          tears.\r\n\r\nJavert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.     \r\n\r\nValjean steps out of the shadows.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          A moment of your time, Javert.\r\n          I do believe this woman's tale.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    \r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          You've done your duty.

To Fantine, it's as if he's come to\r\nher in a dream -\r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          Can this be?\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Where will she end -\r\n          This child without a friend?\r\n\r\nHe holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          I've seen your face before.\r\n          Show me some way to help you.\r\n          How have you come to grief\r\n          In such a place as this?\r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          M'sieur, don't mock me now, I\r\n          pray\r\n          It's hard enough I've lost my\r\n          pride.\r\n          You let your foreman send me\r\n          away.\r\n          Yes, you were there\r\n          And turned aside.\r\n          I never did no wrong.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Is it true what I've done -\r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          My daughter's close to dying.\r\n                                                          33.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               - to an innocent soul?\r\n\r\n                         FANTINE\r\n               If there's a God above -\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               Had I only known then!\r\n\r\n                         FANTINE\r\n               He'd let me die instead.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               In His name my task has just begun.\r\n               I will her to the hospital.                             \r\n\r\n     Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.                             \r\n\r\n     Javert is quietly coldly furious.\r\n\r\n                         JAVERT\r\n               Monsieur le Mayor!                                      \r\n\r\n                         FANTINE\r\n               Bring Cosette back to me.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               Where is she?\r\n\r\n                         FANTINE\r\n               At an inn in Montfermeil...\r\n\r\n                         JAVERT\r\n               Monsieur le Mayor!                                      \r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               I will see it done!

Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse\r\n        the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.\r\n        She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to\r\n        herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle\r\n        on a Cloud'.\r\n\r\n        After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the\r\n        buckets.\r\n\r\n        Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her\r\n        hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.\r\n\r\n                            VALJEAN\r\n                  Hush now, do not be afraid of me.\r\n                  Don't cry.

Hardly knowing why, the little girl\r\n     trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and\r\n     they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle\r\n     on a Cloud' together.\r\n\r\n\r\n43   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               43\r\n\r\n     Valjean enters with Cosette.

They follow it round a corner to\r\n     find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're\r\n     trapped.\r\n\r\n     Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp\r\n     bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower\r\n     the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties\r\n     one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding\r\n     the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to\r\n     brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls\r\n     Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down\r\n     onto the other side.\r\n\r\n     A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.\r\n     Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of\r\n     women's voices, singing a psalm.\r\n\r\n                         NUNS\r\n               Te lucis ante terminum\r\n               Rerum Creator poscimus\r\n               Ut pro tua clementia\r\n               Sis praesul et custodia...\r\n\r\n     Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down\r\n     after her.\r\n\r\n     Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n50   INT.

The monument,\r\n     made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands\r\n     on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far\r\n     side, the remains of the great fortress that was the\r\n     Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built\r\n     triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the\r\n     new regime.\r\n\r\n     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:\r\n\r\n               Paris, 1832.\r\n\r\n     The streets that run from the square lead in one direction\r\n     to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction\r\n     into the slums.\r\n\r\n     The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.\r\n\r\n     A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -\r\n     GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At\r\n     once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from\r\n     every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,\r\n     Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.\r\n\r\n\r\n52   EXT.

The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch       \r\n     what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes      \r\n     gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves.

He is taking out a               \r\n     hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His         \r\n     eye is caught by the ring on his finger.                             \r\n\r\n     CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.                              \r\n\r\n     Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.              \r\n\r\n     We reveal EPONINE staring at him through the door.                   \r\n\r\n                         EPONINE                                          \r\n               Hey there Monsieur what's new                              \r\n               with you?                                                  \r\n               Haven't seen much of you of late.                          \r\n               Planning no doubt to change the                            \r\n               world?                                                     \r\n               Plotting to overthrow the state?                           \r\n               Still living here in this old sewer                        \r\n               Might as well doss down in a ditch                         \r\n               You still pretending to be poor                            \r\n               Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich                         \r\n\r\n     Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.   \r\n     We see glimpses of misery off the stairwell.                    \r\n\r\n                         MARIUS                                           \r\n               How did you...?                                            \r\n\r\n                         EPONINE                                          \r\n               There's lots of things I know                              \r\n\r\n                         MARIUS                                           \r\n               Won't take a franc that I've not                           \r\n               earned                                                     \r\n               All of those bridges have been                             \r\n               burned.                                                    \r\n\r\n                         EPONINE                                          \r\n               I like the way you talk Monsieur!                          \r\n\r\n                         MARIUS                                           \r\n               I like the way you always tease.                           \r\n                                                          62.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.\r\n\r\n                         EPONINE\r\n               Little he knows -\r\n               Little he sees.\r\n\r\n\r\n55   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY                       55     \r\n\r\n     Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau         \r\n     Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees          \r\n     two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,          \r\n     Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The          \r\n     two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from               \r\n     evening church service.                                             \r\n\r\n     Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen\r\n     anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental\r\n     foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.\r\n\r\n     As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets\r\n     his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he\r\n     already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held              \r\n     gaze.                                                               \r\n\r\n     Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,         \r\n     at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.                  \r\n\r\n     Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her\r\n     jealously from this distant boy's gaze.                             \r\n\r\n     We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the             \r\n     Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's           \r\n     approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,                  \r\n     Clacquesous, Montparnasse.                                          \r\n\r\n                          THENARDIER\r\n               Everyone here, you know your\r\n               place -\r\n               Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous -\r\n               You, Montparnasse, watch for the\r\n               law -                                                     \r\n               With Eponine - take care.\r\n                   (Montparnasse hurries over                            \r\n                     to the doorway where                                \r\n                     Eponine was watching                                \r\n                     Marius)                                             \r\n               You turn on the tears!                                    \r\n                   (to Madame Thenardier who                             \r\n                     is holding a baby)                                  \r\n               No mistakes, my dears!\r\n\r\n     Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth          \r\n     of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the               \r\n     ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps            \r\n     behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.                     \r\n                                                     63.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THENARDIER\r\n          Please, M'sieur, come this way.\r\n          Here's a child that ain't eaten\r\n          today.\r\n          Save a life, spare a sou!\r\n          God rewards all the good that you\r\n          do.\r\n\r\nAs Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she          \r\nrecognizes him.                                                 \r\n\r\n                    MADAME THENARDIER                           \r\n          Wait a bit!

PARIS STREETS - DAY                                     85\r\n\r\n     All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.\r\n     The tramp of feet.\r\n\r\n     All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the\r\n     poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical\r\n     students.\r\n                                                     86.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.        \r\n\r\nNow into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL\r\nPROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with\r\nweapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries\r\ncarrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in      \r\nfront, behind a section of military drummers who drum a          \r\nmilitary tatoo.                                                  \r\n\r\nINTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,         \r\nblack plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage         \r\ndraped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a           \r\nCOFFIN.                                                          \r\n\r\nSoftly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin        \r\nto sing.\r\n\r\n                    CROWD\r\n          Do you hear the people sing\r\n          Singing the song of angry men?\r\n          It is the music of a people\r\n          Who will not be slaves again!\r\n\r\nThe police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing\r\nso subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming\r\nfrom. The singing grows stronger.\r\n\r\n                    CROWD\r\n          When the beating of your heart\r\n          Echoes the beating of the drums\r\n          There is a life about to start\r\n          When tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\nThe dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance\r\nuneasily from side to side.                                      \r\n\r\n                    CROWD                                        \r\n          Will you join in our crusade?\r\n          Who will be strong and stand with\r\n          me?                                                    \r\n          Beyond the barricade\r\n          Is there a world you long to see?\r\n\r\nAs the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,     \r\nEnjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing       \r\nthe carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and     \r\nthe procession.                                                  \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS                                     \r\n          Then join in the fight\r\n          That will give you the right\r\n          To be free!\r\n\r\nThe students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the       \r\ncoffin carriage.                                                 \r\n                                                     87.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    STUDENTS/CROWD\r\n          Do you hear the people sing\r\n          Singing the song of angry men?\r\n          It is the music of a people\r\n          Who will not be slaves again!\r\n          When the beating of your heart\r\n          Echoes the beating of the drums\r\n          There is a life about to start\r\n          When tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\nEnjolras, Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb       \r\nonto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by          \r\nCombeferre.                                                    \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Will you give all you can give\r\n          So that our banner may advance?\r\n\r\n                    COURFEYRAC                                 \r\n          Some will fall and some will live\r\n          Will you stand up and take your\r\n          chance?\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS/MARIUS/COURFEYRAC                 \r\n          The blood of the martyrs\r\n          Will water the meadows of France!\r\n\r\nThe crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage,      \r\nblocking the attempts of the police to intervene, singing\r\nwith passion.\r\n\r\n                    STUDENTS/CROWD\r\n          Do you hear the people sing\r\n          Singing the song of angry men?\r\n          It is the music of a people\r\n          Who will not be slaves again!\r\n\r\n          When the beating of your heart\r\n          Echoes the beating of the drums\r\n          There is a life about to start\r\n          When tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\nEnjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now\r\nbecome the procession. They turn off the main street away      \r\nfrom the expected course of the funeral procession.            \r\nGavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche      \r\nand his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.           \r\n\r\nAs the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop       \r\nahead and disappear round a corner.                            \r\n\r\n                    STUDENTS/CROWD\r\n          Will you join in our crusade?\r\n          Who will be strong and stand with\r\n          me?\r\n          Somewhere beyond the barricade\r\n          Is there a world you long to see?\r\n          Do you hear the people sing?\r\n                    (more)\r\n                                                          88.\r\n\r\n                         STUDENTS/CROWD (cont'd)\r\n               Say, do you hear the distant\r\n               drums?\r\n               It is the future that we bring\r\n               When tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\n     The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On   \r\n     one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken       \r\n     down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have        \r\n     taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to        \r\n     provide cover.                                                  \r\n\r\n     There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one              \r\n     nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged             \r\n     kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin         \r\n     carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,        \r\n     grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.        \r\n\r\n     More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral               \r\n     explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the\r\n     dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons\r\n     of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women\r\n     run screaming in terror.                                            \r\n\r\n                         ENJOLRAS\r\n               To the barricades!\r\n\r\n                         STUDENTS/CROWD\r\n               To the barricades! To arms! To\r\n               arms!\r\n\r\n     Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the              \r\n     cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary              \r\n     officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.                \r\n\r\n     The students break away and race off through the cafe into          \r\n     a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A          \r\n     cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the                 \r\n     students and falls through the window of an upended                 \r\n     carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to           \r\n     the slums.                                                          \r\n\r\n\r\n86   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAY             86     \r\n\r\n     FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.           \r\n     They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens            \r\n     including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF           \r\n     who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a         \r\n     gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their             \r\n     husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution           \r\n     on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to                  \r\n     contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to         \r\n     help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining            \r\n     tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.          \r\n     They set to work to build their barricade. Students                 \r\n     commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the               \r\n     barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street              \r\n     hauling an uprooted tree.                                           \r\n                                                     89.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front       \r\ndoors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and     \r\nraid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every      \r\nitem of furniture despite the lamentations and                  \r\nprotestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.              \r\n\r\nAs the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor     \r\nof the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to      \r\nprepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on      \r\na stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and      \r\nsecond floor front rooms with paving stones to create           \r\nprotected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade       \r\nis built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The      \r\noutside is a crazy knarled mess.                                \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Here upon these stones\r\n          We will build our barricade.\r\n          In the heart of the city\r\n          We claim as our own\r\n          Each man to his duty\r\n          And don't be afraid.\r\n\r\nA man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing         \r\nbarricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps      \r\nhis head down.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Wait!\r\n          I will need a report\r\n          On the strength of the foe.\r\n\r\nThe man who's just arrived looks up.

Two smaller barricades            \r\n      protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras              \r\n      climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his              \r\n      little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame            \r\n      Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing         \r\n      armchair - and adds it to the barricade.

The students have been waiting for hours.\r\n\r\n      A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles\r\n      underlights a fluttering red flag.\r\n\r\n      There is no sign yet of any opposition.\r\n\r\n      A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade.

Seizing his              \r\nopportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to          \r\nsubdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied     \r\nto the staircase.                                                 \r\n\r\n                     ENJOLRAS                                     \r\n           When are they coming!?                                 \r\n\r\nSilence.                                                          \r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at\r\nthe barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of\r\nmarching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First\r\nsoft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.\r\nBoots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nEnjolras and all the students man the main barricade.             \r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nThey peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all\r\nthey can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These\r\nare bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection\r\nfrom the torch.\r\n\r\nA voice shouts out from the darkness.\r\n                                                     93.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ARMY OFFICER\r\n          Who's there?\r\n\r\nAt the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          French Revolution.\r\n\r\n                    ARMY OFFICER\r\n          Fire!\r\n\r\nA flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as\r\nthough the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.\r\n\r\nA dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag\r\nfalls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the\r\ncornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound\r\nseveral men.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n              (as students return fire)                           \r\n          Comrades, do not fire back! Do not                      \r\n          waste powder!                                           \r\n\r\nIn the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop      \r\nreloading weapons.                                                \r\n\r\nEnjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up      \r\nwhen the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many                  \r\ninsurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the     \r\ntop of the barricade.                                             \r\n\r\n                    ARMY OFFICER\r\n          Who's there?

While everyone is reacting to   \r\nthe dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from   \r\nnoticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of\r\ndarkness to creep down the street.\r\n\r\nAll at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the\r\nrattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over\r\nthe barricade. The students run for their guns and return\r\nfire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the\r\nfirst instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the\r\nbarricade, where they're driven back by the fierce\r\nresistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier\r\naiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of\r\nMarius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.\r\n                                                       94.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is\r\nfierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost   \r\nunless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to\r\nthe top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of\r\ndeadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel.\r\n\r\n                     MARIUS\r\n          Clear out or I'll blow up the\r\n          barricade!\r\n\r\nEveryone freezes.\r\n\r\n                    ARMY OFFICER\r\n          Blow it up then and take yourself\r\n          with it!\r\n\r\n                    MARIUS\r\n          And myself with it!\r\n\r\nMarius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.\r\n\r\nBut already the soldiers have cleared out.\r\n\r\nMarius comes down from the barricade.                             \r\n\r\n                     FEUILLY                                      \r\n              (to Marius)                                         \r\n          Thank you!                                              \r\n\r\n                    LESGLES                                       \r\n          What were you thinking!                                 \r\n\r\nAs everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine\r\nlying propped against the barricade.\r\n\r\n                    MARIUS\r\n          Eponine!

INN, RUE DE L'HOMME ARMEE, PARIS - NIGHT               89     \r\n\r\n     The LANDLADY climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The          \r\n     landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly.\r\n     The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean.\r\n\r\n                         GAVROCHE\r\n               Letter for Cosette.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               I'll take it.\r\n\r\n     Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite\r\n     giving it, the other hand open for a tip.\r\n\r\n     Valjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over\r\n     the letter.\r\n\r\n                         GAVROCHE\r\n               Something for you, something for\r\n               me. Who needs charity?\r\n\r\n\r\n90   INT. VALJEAN'S ROOM, LODGING HOUSE - NIGHT                  90     \r\n\r\n     ON VALJEAN - As he reads the note.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               `Dearest Cosette, you have\r\n               entered my soul\r\n               And soon you will be gone.\r\n               Can it be only a day since we met\r\n               And the world was reborn?\r\n               If I should fall in the battle to\r\n               come\r\n               Let this be my goodbye.\r\n               Now that I know you love me as\r\n               well\r\n               It is harder to die.\r\n               I pray that God will bring me\r\n               home\r\n               To be with you.\r\n               Pray for your Marius.\r\n               He prays for you.'\r\n\r\n     He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought\r\n     of losing Cosette.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               They haven't got a chance, these\r\n               boys\r\n               They almost certainly will die\r\n               She'll be alone\r\n               And she will need me all the more\r\n               And we will go on as before                              \r\n               When he is gone\r\n               I dare not think like this\r\n               I must find this boy\r\n                                                          98.\r\n\r\n\r\n91   EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT                                   91\r\n\r\n     Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes,\r\n     struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade\r\n     being dismantled. And bodies.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead\r\n     soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.\r\n\r\n     He continues on his way in the dark.\r\n\r\n     Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time\r\n     towards the very barricade where Marius waits.\r\n\r\n     Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through\r\n     their lines, and into the shadows.\r\n\r\n     As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the          \r\n     rooftops.\r\n\r\n\r\n92   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                       92\r\n\r\n     Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching\r\n     from the far end of the narrow street.\r\n\r\n     The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the\r\n     soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.\r\n     Gavroche jumps up.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN                                         \r\n               Don't shoot!                                              \r\n\r\n                         JOLY\r\n               Here comes a man in uniform!\r\n               What brings you to this place?\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               I come here as a volunteer.\r\n\r\n                         JOLY\r\n               Approach and show your face!\r\n\r\n                         PROUVAIRE\r\n               You wear an army uniform.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               That's why they let me through.\r\n\r\n     The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let\r\n     Valjean enter.\r\n\r\n                         JOLY\r\n               You've got some years behind you,\r\n               sir.\r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               There's much that I can do.\r\n                                                     99.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JOLY\r\n          You see that prisoner over there?\r\n\r\nHe points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.\r\n\r\n                    GRANTAIRE\r\n          A volunteer like you!\r\n\r\n                    COMBEFERRE\r\n          A spy who calls himself Javert!\r\n\r\n                    GRANTAIRE\r\n          He's going to get it too!                              \r\n\r\nJavert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n                    GAVROCHE                                     \r\n          Don't shoot! I know him! He's no                       \r\n          soldier!                                               \r\n\r\nSuddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the     \r\nroofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at\r\nEnjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them      \r\nsending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and\r\nthe snipers are driven back.\r\n\r\nThere is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a   \r\nbrief fire fight ensues.                                        \r\n\r\nThe snipers have disappeared.                                    \r\n\r\nEnjolras turns to Valjean.                                       \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          For your presence of mind,\r\n          For the deed you have done,\r\n          I will thank you, M'sieur,\r\n          When our battle is won.\r\n\r\n                    MARIUS\r\n          Thank you, M'sieur.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Give me no thanks, M'sieur.\r\n          There's something you can do.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          If it is in my power.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Give me the spy Javert!\r\n          Let me take care of him.\r\n\r\nJavert hears this with grim satisfaction.\r\n                                                    100.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          The law is inside out.\r\n          The world is upside down.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Do what you have to do -\r\n          The man belongs to you.\r\n\r\nHe turns to his little army.\r\n\r\n                     ENJOLRAS\r\n          The enemy may be regrouping!\r\n          Hold yourselves in readiness!\r\n          Come, my friends, back to your\r\n          positions!\r\n          The dawn is breaking fast.\r\n\r\nValjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He     \r\ncarries a knife.                                             \r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          We meet again...\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          You've hungered for this all your\r\n          life.\r\n          Take your revenge.\r\n          How right you should kill with a\r\n          knife.\r\n\r\nValjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          You talk too much.\r\n          Your life is safe in my hands.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Don't understand...\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Get out of here.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Valjean, take care!\r\n          I'm warning you.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Clear out of here!\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Once a thief, forever a thief.\r\n          What you want, you always steal.\r\n          You would trade your life for\r\n          mine.\r\n          Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!\r\n          Shoot me now for all I care -\r\n          If you let me go, beware!\r\n          You'll still answer to Javert!\r\n                                                    101.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          You are wrong, and always have\r\n          been wrong.\r\n          I'm a man no worse than any man.\r\n          You are free, and there are no\r\n          conditions -\r\n          No bargains or petitions.\r\n          There's nothing that I blame you\r\n          for.\r\n          You've done your duty, nothing\r\n          more.\r\n          No doubt our paths will cross\r\n          again.\r\n\r\nHe raises his gun and points it at Javert.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Go!\r\n\r\nAs Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single\r\nshot into the air.                                              \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Courfeyrac, you take the watch -\r\n          They may attack before it's\r\n          light.\r\n          Everybody keep the faith,\r\n          For certain as our banner flies,\r\n          We are not alone -\r\n          The people too must rise!\r\n\r\nMarius is manically working to raise the height of one of the   \r\nsmaller barricades.                                             \r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS                                    \r\n          Marius, rest.\r\n\r\nGrantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is   \r\ntaken up more seriously by Feuilly.

He comes to a               \r\n     stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.           \r\n\r\n                         VALJEAN\r\n               God on high\r\n               Hear my prayer\r\n                         (more)\r\n                                                            103.\r\n\r\n                          VALJEAN (cont'd)\r\n               In my need\r\n               You have always been there.\r\n               He is young\r\n               He's afraid\r\n               Let him rest\r\n               Heaven blessed.\r\n               Bring him home\r\n               Bring him home\r\n               Bring him home!\r\n               He's like the son I might have\r\n               known\r\n               If God had granted me a son.\r\n               The summers die\r\n               One by one\r\n               How soon they fly\r\n               On and on\r\n               And I am old\r\n               And will be gone.\r\n               Bring him peace\r\n               Bring him joy\r\n               He is young\r\n               He is only a boy.\r\n               You can take\r\n               You can give\r\n               Let him be\r\n               Let him live,                                              \r\n               If I die, let me die\r\n               Let him live\r\n               Bring him home\r\n               Bring him home\r\n               Bring him home!\r\n\r\n     Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.                 \r\n\r\n     CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded\r\n     street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets\r\n     round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many\r\n     that we know the little band can never win.\r\n\r\n     CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that\r\n     entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the\r\n     centre of the bright lights of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n94   EXT.

BARRICADE - DAWN                                      96\r\n\r\n     Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate.\r\n     He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No       \r\n     one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a\r\n     crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the\r\n     students are up and getting ready.\r\n\r\n                         ENJOLRAS\r\n               The people have not stirred.\r\n\r\n                         COURFEYRAC                                    \r\n               Yet we will not abandon those                           \r\n               Who still live in fear.\r\n\r\n                         ENJOLRAS                                      \r\n               The people have not heard,\r\n               Yet we will not abandon those who\r\n               cannot hear.\r\n               Let us not waste lives!\r\n               Let all who wish to                                     \r\n               Go from here!\r\n\r\n     There is silence.

A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\n                    COURFEYRAC\r\n          No-o!\r\n\r\nHe runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his\r\narms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the\r\ngate in the barricade.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees\r\nthis gate. And talks to the Army Officer.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed\r\ndrawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is\r\nlining up the big guns carefully.\r\n                                                      106.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ARMY OFFICER\r\n          You at the barricades listen to\r\n          this!\r\n          The people of Paris sleep in\r\n          their beds!\r\n          You have no chance,\r\n          No chance at all!\r\n          Why throw your lives away?\r\n\r\nEnjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Let us die facing our foes!\r\n          Make them bleed while we can!\r\n\r\n                    COMBEFERRE\r\n          Make'em pay through the nose!\r\n\r\n                    COURFEYRAC\r\n          Make'em pay for every man!\r\n\r\n                    ENJOLRAS\r\n          Let others rise to take our place\r\n          Until the earth is free!\r\n\r\nThe sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\r\n\r\nThe bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake     \r\na massive barrage of musket fire.\r\n\r\nThe big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst\r\nright through in the first hit.\r\n\r\nBullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball\r\nsmashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the\r\nattackers.\r\n\r\nEnjolras and the students throw themselves onto the\r\nbarricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles\r\ndown to others to be re-loaded, firing again.\r\n\r\nValjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting\r\ndown the dead, regardless of his own safety.\r\n\r\nMarius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs\r\ntowards him -\r\n\r\nCRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade\r\nand now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of\r\nstudent fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Caf\u00e9\r\nMusain.\r\n                                                          107.\r\n\r\n\r\n97    INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                       97\r\n\r\n      Students and soldiers fight in the caf\u00e9, on the stairs, up\r\n      the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the\r\n      pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it\r\n      to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -\r\n      students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants\r\n      of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n98    EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                         98\r\n\r\n      Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the\r\n      onrush of the soldiers -\r\n\r\n\r\n99    INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                       99\r\n\r\n      The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling\r\n      sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to\r\n      clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the\r\n      students are falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n100   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                       100\r\n\r\n      Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier\r\n      challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the\r\n      soldier flying -\r\n\r\n\r\n101   INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                      101\r\n\r\n      The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find\r\n      there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,\r\n      knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the\r\n      soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from\r\n      his drunken slumber.\r\n\r\n                          GRANTAIRE\r\n                Long live the republic!\r\n\r\n      He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.\r\n      Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his\r\n      now-ragged red flag.\r\n\r\n      The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.\r\n      Enjolras falls back -\r\n\r\n\r\n102   EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                        102\r\n\r\n      Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he\r\n      hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,\r\n      streaming like blood down the wall.\r\n                                                          108.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the\r\n      remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble\r\n      for any last pockets of resistance.\r\n\r\n      BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.\r\n      INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of\r\n      law over rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n103   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                       103\r\n\r\n      Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs\r\n      between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -\r\n      and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of\r\n      soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.\r\n\r\n      Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the\r\n      ground. A storm drain.\r\n\r\n      ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the\r\n      end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.\r\n\r\n                          SOLDIER\r\n                Nothing here!\r\n\r\n      The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.\r\n\r\n      Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily\r\n      fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.\r\n      He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the\r\n      grating has been lifted.\r\n\r\n      He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does\r\n      the drain lead?\r\n\r\n\r\n104   INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY                                     104\r\n\r\n      Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping\r\n      pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,\r\n      then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint\r\n      light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The\r\n      skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.\r\n\r\n      Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as\r\n      he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an\r\n      intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through\r\n      distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he\r\n      lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground\r\n      to rest. He lets his eyes close.\r\n\r\n      A voice echoes in the shadows.\r\n                                                    109.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THENARDIER\r\n          Here's a hint of gold\r\n          Stuck into a tooth -\r\n          Pardon me, m'sieur,\r\n          You won't be needing it no more.\r\n          Shouldn't be too hard to sell.\r\n\r\nA figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No\r\nsign of life in either Valjean or Marius.\r\n\r\n                    THENARDIER\r\n          Well, someone's got to clean'em\r\n          up, my friends,\r\n          Before the little harvest\r\n          Disappears into the mud.\r\n          Someone's got to collect their\r\n          odds and ends\r\n          When the gutters run with blood.\r\n\r\nNow we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on\r\nMarius's finger and pulls it off.\r\n\r\n                    THENARDIER\r\n          Here's a tasty ring\r\n          Pretty little thing\r\n          Heart's no longer going\r\n          And he's lived his little time,\r\n          But his watch is ticking yet.\r\n\r\n          It's a world where the dog eats\r\n          the dog.\r\n          Where they kill for the bones in\r\n          the street.\r\n          And God in his heaven,\r\n          He don't interfere\r\n          Cos he's dead as the stiff at my\r\n          feet!\r\n          I raise my eyes to see the\r\n          heavens\r\n          And only the moon looks down.\r\n          The harvest moon shines down!\r\n\r\nValjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,\r\nslams him against the sewer wall.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          How do I get out of here?\r\n\r\n                    THENARDIER\r\n          There! That way!\r\n\r\nValjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.\r\n\r\nThenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the\r\nwrong way.\r\n\r\nLATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and\r\nthey're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.\r\n                                                             110.\r\n\r\n\r\n      As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his\r\n      arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man\r\n      above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-\r\n      submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and\r\n      suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is\r\n      dropping -\r\n\r\n      Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes\r\n      burning with his refusal to be beaten.\r\n\r\n      LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on\r\n      his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the\r\n      rushing sound of the river.\r\n\r\n      Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.                           \r\n\r\n      He drags himself on through the shallow running water\r\n      towards the moonlight.                                                \r\n\r\n      He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n105   EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT                          105     \r\n\r\n      Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer\r\n      onto the embankment that runs beside the river.\r\n\r\n      He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.\r\n\r\n      Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once\r\n      more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near\r\n      the end of his strength.\r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN\r\n                It's you, Javert!\r\n                I knew you wouldn't wait too\r\n                long.\r\n                The faithful servant at his post\r\n                once more.\r\n                This man's done no wrong.\r\n                And he needs his family's care.\r\n\r\n                          JAVERT\r\n                I warned you I would not give in!\r\n                I won't be swayed!\r\n\r\n                          VALJEAN\r\n                Another hour yet\r\n                And then I'm yours\r\n                And all our debts are paid.\r\n\r\n                          JAVERT\r\n                The man of mercy comes again\r\n                And talks of justice!\r\n                                                    111.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Come, time is running short -\r\n          Look down, Javert!\r\n          He's standing in his grave!\r\n\r\nHe starts to move past Javert.\r\n\r\nJavert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          One more step and you die.\r\n\r\nValjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Then I die.\r\n\r\nHe starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it\r\nholds the pistol.\r\n\r\nValjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but\r\nhe just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he\r\nlowers the gun.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Take him, Valjean,\r\n          Before I change my mind!\r\n          I will be waiting...\r\n          24601!\r\n\r\nHe turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He\r\nstares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          Who is this man?\r\n          What sort of devil is he?\r\n          To have caught me in a trap\r\n          And choose to let me go free?\r\n          It was his hour at last\r\n          To put a seal on my fate\r\n          Wipe out the past\r\n          And wash me clean off the slate!\r\n          All it would take\r\n          Was a flick of his knife\r\n          Vengeance was his\r\n          And he gave me back my life!\r\n\r\nHe begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,\r\ntowards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the\r\nturmoil in his brain.\r\n\r\n                     JAVERT\r\n          Damned if I live in the debt of a\r\n          thief!\r\n          Damned if I yield at the end of\r\n          the chase!\r\n                     (more)\r\n                                                    112.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT (cont'd)\r\n          I am the law and the law is not\r\n          mocked!\r\n          I'll spit his pity right back in\r\n          his face!\r\n          There is nothing on earth that we\r\n          share!\r\n          It is either Valjean or Javert!\r\n          How can I allow this man\r\n          To hold dominion over me?\r\n          This desperate man that I have\r\n          hunted...\r\n          He gave me my life!

But live in\r\n          hell!\r\n\r\nHe moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he\r\nstands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.\r\nThe Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents\r\nswirl round the piles of the bridge.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          And my thoughts fly apart\r\n          Can this man be believed?\r\n          Shall his sins be forgiven?\r\n          Shall his crimes be reprieved?\r\n\r\n          And must I now begin to doubt\r\n          Who never doubted all those\r\n          years?\r\n          My heart is stone and still it\r\n          trembles...\r\n          The world I have known is lost in\r\n          shadow\r\n          Is he from heaven or from hell?\r\n          And does he know\r\n          That granting me my life today\r\n          This man has killed me even so?\r\n\r\nHe climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the\r\nnight sky.\r\n\r\n                    JAVERT\r\n          I am reaching but I fall\r\n          And the stars are black and cold\r\n          As I stare into the void\r\n          Of a world that cannot hold...\r\n\r\n          I'll escape now from that world\r\n          From the world of Jean Valjean\r\n          This is nowhere I can turn...\r\n          There is no way to go on...\r\n                                                             113.\r\n\r\n\r\n      He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he\r\n      wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,\r\n      turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close\r\n      over him. And he's lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n106   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                         106\r\n\r\n      Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade. Women\r\n      move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among\r\n      the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both\r\n      the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's\r\n      mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the\r\n      slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 1\r\n                Did you see them\r\n                Going off to fight?\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 2\r\n                Children of the barricade\r\n                Who didn't last the night.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 3\r\n                Did you see them\r\n                Lying where they died?\r\n                Someone used to cradle them\r\n                And kiss them when they cried.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 4\r\n                Did you see them lying side by\r\n                side?\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 5\r\n                Who will wake them?\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 6\r\n                No one ever will.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 2\r\n                No one ever told them that\r\n                A summer day can kill.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 7\r\n                They were schoolboys\r\n                Never held a gun\r\n                Fighting for a new world that\r\n                Would rise up like the sun.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN 3\r\n                Where's that new world\r\n                Now the fighting's done?\r\n\r\n      The women move off to go about their day's business.\r\n                                                             114.\r\n\r\n\r\n107   INT.

She takes his hand\r\n        as he prays.\r\n\r\n                            FANTINE\r\n                  M'sieur I bless your name...\r\n\r\n                            VALJEAN\r\n                  I am ready, Fantine...\r\n\r\n                            FANTINE\r\n                  M'sieur lay down your burden...\r\n                                                           123.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN                                         \r\n                 At the end of my days...                                  \r\n\r\n                           FANTINE                                         \r\n                 You raised my child in love,                              \r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN                                         \r\n                 She's the best of my life...                              \r\n\r\n                           FANTINE                                         \r\n                 And you will be with God.                                 \r\n\r\n\r\n116A   EXT. CONVENT CLOISTERS - NIGHT                             116A\r\n\r\n       Cosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the\r\n       chapel in the middle of the cloisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n116B   INT. CONVENT CHAPEL - NIGHT                                116B\r\n\r\n       The sound of the door opening. Valjean looks round. It's\r\n       Cosette entering, followed by Marius.\r\n\r\n                              VALJEAN\r\n                 Cosette?\r\n\r\n       Tears form in his eyes. Cosette goes to him, kneels before\r\n       him, takes him in her arms.\r\n\r\n                           COSETTE\r\n                 Papa, papa, I do not understand -\r\n                 Are you all right? Why did you go\r\n                 away?\r\n\r\n                           VALJEAN\r\n                 Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven\r\n                 now?\r\n                 Thank God, thank God, I've lived\r\n                 to see this day!\r\n\r\n       Marius comes to him.\r\n\r\n                            MARIUS\r\n                 It's you who must forgive a\r\n                 thoughtless fool!\r\n                 It's you who must forgive a\r\n                 thankless man!\r\n                 It's thanks to you that I am\r\n                 living,\r\n                 And again I lay down my life at\r\n                 your feet.\r\n                 Cosette, your father is a saint!\r\n                 When they wounded me\r\n                 He took me from the barricade,\r\n                 Carried like a babe,\r\n                 And brought me home to you!\r\n                                                     124.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Now you are here\r\n          Again beside me\r\n          Now I can die in peace\r\n          For now my life is blessed...\r\n\r\n                    COSETTE\r\n          You will live, papa\r\n          You're going to live\r\n          It's too soon\r\n          Too soon to say goodbye.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to\r\n          die!\r\n          I'll obey\r\n          I will try...\r\n\r\nHe holds out a letter for her.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          On this page\r\n          I write my last confession.\r\n          Read it well\r\n          When I at last am sleeping.\r\n          It's the story\r\n          Of one who turned from hating\r\n          A man who only learned to love\r\n          When you were in his keeping.\r\n\r\nCosette takes the letter and kisses it.\r\n\r\n                    COSETTE\r\n          I know it, papa.\r\n\r\nValjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where\r\nthe candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees\r\nthree ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The\r\nghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with\r\nlove, the ghost of Eponine.\r\n\r\nFantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          I'm ready now, Fantine.\r\n\r\n                    FANTINE\r\n          Come with me\r\n          Where chains will never bind you\r\n          All your grief\r\n          At last, at last behind you\r\n          Lord in heaven\r\n          Look down on him in mercy -\r\n\r\n                    VALJEAN\r\n          Forgive me all my trespasses\r\n          And take me to your glory!\r\n                                                           125.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.\r\n\r\n      Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine\r\n      take them.\r\n\r\n                          FANTINE/EPONINE\r\n                Take my hand\r\n                I'll lead you to salvation\r\n                Take my love\r\n                For love is everlasting...\r\n\r\n                          VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP\r\n                And remember\r\n                The truth that once was spoken:\r\n                To love another person\r\n                Is to see the face of God...\r\n\r\n      Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the\r\n      cloister.\r\n\r\n      What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the\r\n      man who has just died.\r\n\r\n      The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.\r\n      The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now\r\n      Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the\r\n      wall of candles, all three are gone.\r\n\r\n      As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high\r\n      over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets\r\n      outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the\r\n      streets. Dawn is breaking.\r\n\r\n      From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -\r\n\r\n\r\n117   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY                             117\r\n\r\n      THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the\r\n      rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street\r\n      battle. Past the remains of a barricade.\r\n\r\n      The distant sound of an approaching march.\r\n\r\n      SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:\r\n\r\n                Sixteen years later\r\n                Paris, 1848.\r\n\r\n      From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march\r\n      become the words of a song.\r\n\r\n                          MARCHERS\r\n                Do you hear the people sing\r\n                Lost in the valley of the night?\r\n                It is the music of a people\r\n                Who are climbing to the light\r\n                For the wretched of the earth\r\n                          (more)\r\n                                                    126.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS (cont'd)\r\n          There is a flame that never dies\r\n          Even the darkest night will end\r\n          And the sun will rise.\r\n\r\nAs THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la\r\nBastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but\r\nthe great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become\r\nincorporated into an immense barricade - three stories\r\nhigh, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that\r\nconverge on the square we now see the multiple victory\r\nmarches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they\r\nclimb up to the top of the barricade.\r\n\r\nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:\r\n\r\n          The people of Paris have risen in\r\n          their tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n          The King has fled. A new Republic\r\n          is born.\r\n\r\nThere in the forefront of one column march Marius and\r\nCosette.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS\r\n          They will live again in freedom\r\n          In the garden of the Lord\r\n          They will walk behind the plough-\r\n          share\r\n          They will put away the sword\r\n          The chain will be broken\r\n          And all men will have their\r\n          reward!\r\n\r\nAs the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many\r\nthere are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among\r\nthem we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the\r\nstudents who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -\r\n\r\nAnd out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the\r\ngrinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the\r\nelephant, as the crowd fill the square.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS\r\n          Will you join in our crusade?\r\n          Who will be strong and stand with\r\n          me?\r\n          Somewhere beyond the barricade\r\n          Is there a world you long to see?\r\n\r\nAs the marchers converge, there watching them are\r\nThenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a\r\nwave of greeting. Survivors to the last.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS\r\n          Do you hear the people sing?\r\n          Say, do you hear the distant\r\n          drums?\r\n                    (more)\r\n                                                    127.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS (cont'd)\r\n          It is the future that they bring\r\n          When tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\nNow among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing\r\nwith the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red\r\nflags.\r\n\r\n                    MARCHERS\r\n          Will you join in our crusade?\r\n          Who will be strong and stand with\r\n          me?\r\n          Somewhere beyond the barricade\r\n          Is there a world you long to see?\r\n          Do you hear the people sing?\r\n          Say, do you hear the distant\r\n          drums?\r\n          It is the future that they bring\r\n          When tomorrow comes...\r\n          Tomorrow comes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND CREDITS\r\n\n\n\n\nLes Miserables\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0William Nicholson\u00a0\u00a0Alain Boublil\u00a0\u00a0Claude- Michel Schonberg\u00a0\u00a0Herbert Kretzmer\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Musical\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:29:16.510326"}
