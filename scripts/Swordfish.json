STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING\n\n    Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and\n    talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table;\n    STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early\n    forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly\n    expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough\n    said. The MAN across, however, is quite different.

Arguably Pacino's\n                greatest performance, excepting\n                The Godfather, Part I, and\n                Scarface, of course. A\n                masterpiece of directing, easily\n                Lumet's best. The acting, the\n                script, cinematography, all top\n                notch. But, they didn't push the\n                envelope. What if in Dog Day,\n                Sonny really wanted to get away\n                with it? What if, and here's\n                where it gets tricky.

Suddenly the THUMP of\n    HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the\n    soundtrack.\n\n    Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and\n    a bunch of news vultures.

Unbeknownst\n     to him however, a tiny red aiming laser has zipped\n     through the glass and is now positioned as a dot on\n     Torvalds' throat.\n\n\n48   INT.

In the back, he sees a face he recognizes.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              49.\n\n65   CONTINUED:                                                     65\n\n     CLOSEUP ON ROBERTS\n\n\n     BACK TO STAN\n\n                                STANLEY\n                  Shit...\n\n     The man kinda smiles at Stan.\n\n                                DARK SUIT #1\n                         (being a dick)\n                  Gotta suck to be you.\n\n                                STANLEY\n                  Yep.\n\n     Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge\n     of his nose and jumps out of the car.\n\n\n     INT. TAURUS\n\n     Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps\n     over the railing.\n\n\n66   EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY                                         66\n\n     We realize what Stan did probably wasn't the smartest\n     move in the world. The cliff is just barely on this side\n     of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards\n     straight down to the PCH.\n\n     Stan falls in SLOW MOTION about thirty feet before the\n     cliff face angles out enough to break his fall. He begins\n     a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff.\n\n\n67   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE (STREET) - DAY                               67\n\n     Roberts runs to the railing and sees Stanley sliding/\n     falling down the hill.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              50.\n\n67   CONTINUED:                                                     67\n\n                                ROBERTS\n                         (to his men)\n                  Cut him off at the bottom.\n\n     Roberts then hops the railing, as his men scramble for\n     the car.\n\n\n68   EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY                                         68\n\n     Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the\n     rolling fall down the hill.\n\n\n     ANGLE ON STANLEY\n\n     as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and\n     battered by the sharp, rocky ground.\n\n     Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for\n     fifteen feet. Then it really gets bad.\n\n     Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill\n     to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is\n     the world's largest Slip and Slide.\n\n     He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent.\n     Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and\n     bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.\n\n     Roberts, above him, is doing little better.\n\n\n     LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE\n\n     As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of\n     blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH.\n\n     Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road.   He runs\n     headlong into the traffic.\n\n     CARS SCREECH, HORNS BLARING, as they slide into each\n     other. Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of\n     escaping.\n\n     Roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a CAR\n     SLIDES sideways   into Stan, flipping him over it. Stan,\n     not stopping to   feel the pain, runs across the hood of a\n     freshly-stopped   car.\n\n                                                           51.\n\n69   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                            69\n\n     On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs\n     down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route.\n     Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian\n     accident which slowed him down a little. Stan however is\n     faster.\n\n     Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach\n     at full speed.\n\n     Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach\n     at Stanley. Stan veers, now running through the surf.\n     The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide\n     across the hood to keep from getting whacked. The Taurus\n     breaks left, and slides further into the surf.\n\n     The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus\n     down, tires spinning, throwing sand. Stan continues to\n     run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus.\n\n                             ROBERTS\n               Fuck this.\n\n     He pulls his .40 CAL. from his shoulder holster and FIRES\n     it into the air. Roberts bends over trying to catch his\n     breath.\n\n     Stanley stops, putting his hands up.\n\n                             DARK SUIT #2\n               Why didn't you do that earlier,\n               sir?\n\n     Roberts looks at the agent.\n\n                             DARK SUIT #2\n               Sorry, sir.\n\n                             ROBERTS\n               Go get him.\n\n     Three of the agents bring Stanley over.\n\n     Stan slides down by the back wheel.\n\n                             ROBERTS\n               What are you doing in L.A., Stan?\n\n                              STANLEY\n                      (catching his\n                       breath)\n               Vacationing...\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               52.\n\n69   CONTINUED:                                                      69\n\n                                ROBERTS\n                  Why were you running?

It shifts into reverse and slowly\n      backs over the curb and into the bank.\n\n      A huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two\n      parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively\n      sealing off the front of the glass bank. Mercs begin\n      welding metal plates around the armored bus. We hear the\n      approaching SIRENS of a fleet of cop cars.\n\n                                                                86.\n\n110   EXT.
