Then it really gets bad.\n\n     Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill\n     to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is\n     the world's largest Slip and Slide.\n\n     He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent.\n     Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and\n     bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.\n\n     Roberts, above him, is doing little better.\n\n\n<b>     LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE\n</b>\n     As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of\n     blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH.\n\n     Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road.

Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of\n     escaping.\n\n     Roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a CAR\n     SLIDES sideways   into Stan, flipping him over it.

The Taurus\n     breaks left, and slides further into the surf.\n\n     The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus\n     down, tires spinning, throwing sand.
