Behind him is a yellow\n    billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading \"Fuller\n    vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT.\" We could make out more of\n    the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around\n    it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.\n\n<b>                              EASY\n</b>                 Joppy, how much they payin' out\n                 there at McDonell Douglas?\n\n<b>                               JOPPY\n</b>                 I don't know.

He's lying on his back like a crucifix\n     with a butcher knife buried in his chest. There's blood\n     that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face\n     and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello.\n\n     Easy actually does throw up and doubles over, dropping to a\n     knee to keep his balance and some control. He stays there\n     for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a\n     spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt. He lifts it off the\n     floor and smells it. He wipes his mouth with the\n     handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in\n     his pocket.

From a RADIO in another\n     room Tommy Dorsey plays \"Blue Skies\" with Frank Sinatra out\n     front.
