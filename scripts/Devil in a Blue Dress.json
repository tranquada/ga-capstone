CHAMPION AIRCRAFT - BENNY GIACOMO'S OFFICE                1\n\n    A battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown\n    skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a\n    pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.\n\n                             O.S.

Skin\n    darker than a Louisiana Creole.\n\n    He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the\n    whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet\n    kicked up on the desk, fully in charge.\n\n    A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in\n    more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a\n    calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948.\n\n                             BENNY\n                      (continuing)\n                And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd\n                give you your job back...

Do... you... have...\n                 something... to say?\n\n    Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about\n    swallowing his pride as well. And then:\n\n                              EASY\n                 I want my job back, Mr. Giacomo.

But Easy\n    is up too, blocking his way out the door.\n\n                              EASY\n                 Ezekiel, Mr. Giacomo.\n\n                                BENNY\n                 Hunh?\n\n                              EASY\n                 My name is Ezekiel...

And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a\n    field goal with his right knee.\n\n    Slowly, Giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he\n    shrugs.\n\n                                                                3.\n\n1   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 1\n\n                              BENNY\n                 S'cuse me, Ezekiel.\n\n    And he walks around Easy, shaking his head as if amused.\n\n    Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from\n    Duke Ellington's \"Absinthe\" snakes up like sin and we\n\n2   FADE TO BLACK                                                    2\n\n    And watch the titles, the last one reading \"Two Weeks\n    Later\"...\n\n    FADE IN:\n\n3   EXT.

Two-storied storefronts with\n    canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in\n    a hurry.\n\n    The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac\n    convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.\n\n    Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open\n    windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits\n    Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.\n\n4   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                                 4\n\n    T-Bone Walker's \"Westside Baby\" plays on the jukebox as Easy\n    takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out.\n\n    THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the\n    table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a\n    middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion\n    smiling and waving.\n\n    Above the happy couple is a headline \"CARTER DROPS OUT OF\n    RACE\"... The caption under the photo reads \"Wealthy civic\n    leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be,\n    Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for\n    comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race.\"\n\n                              O.S.

Dammit,\n                 what'd I tell you?\n\n    The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big\n    stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top\n    of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow\n    billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading \"Fuller\n    vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT.\" We could make out more of\n    the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around\n    it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.\n\n                              EASY\n                 Joppy, how much they payin' out\n                 there at McDonell Douglas?\n\n                               JOPPY\n                 I don't know.   Don't it say--\n\n    His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door.\n\n    Easy looks up also at\n\n    THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white\n    MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the\n    room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the\n    tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to\n    the far end of the bar.\n\n    Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he\n    is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like\n    he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly\n    hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in\n    close to talk in private.\n\n    Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he\n    takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.\n    After a moment...\n\n                              JOPPY\n                 Easy, come on over here.
