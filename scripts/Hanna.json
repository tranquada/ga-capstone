FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1\r\n\r\n          Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the\r\n          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.\r\n          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,\r\n          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She\r\n          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost\r\n          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.\r\n          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.\r\n          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling\r\n          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head\r\n          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of\r\n          an arrow piercing its skin.\r\n          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet\r\n          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam\r\n          pouring from its nostrils.\r\n          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her\r\n          knees.\r\n          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.\r\n          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I just missed your heart.\r\n          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist\r\n          holster.\r\n          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.\r\n\r\n          CUT TO TITLE: HANNA\r\n\r\n          2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2\r\n\r\n          A knife enters the deer near its anus.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPER)\r\n          Remove the penis and scrotum, make\r\n          a deep, circular cut around the\r\n          rectum.\r\n          HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPER)\r\n          Cut from the rear to the brisket.\r\n          She works calmly without expression.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3\r\n\r\n          The deer lies on it's side.\r\n          HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity\r\n          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.\r\n          She freezes, sensing danger.\r\n          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out\r\n          into the still forest. No sound.\r\n          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands\r\n          behind her like a ghost.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          You're dead. Right now. I've\r\n          killed you.\r\n          HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings\r\n          her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open\r\n          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the\r\n          snow.\r\n          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She\r\n          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her\r\n          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          Use your hands!\r\n          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.\r\n          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and\r\n          tossing it deep into the forest.\r\n          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.\r\n          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...\r\n          ... but she can't.\r\n          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.\r\n          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows\r\n          a touch of frustration.\r\n          He plods into the forest.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          Drag it back yourself.\r\n          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its\r\n          dead face.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n          4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4\r\n\r\n          HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on\r\n          to a stick. No sign she was ever there.\r\n\r\n          5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5\r\n\r\n          HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts\r\n          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.\r\n          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching\r\n          her.\r\n\r\n          6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6\r\n\r\n          A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the\r\n          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the\r\n          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.\r\n\r\n          7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7\r\n\r\n          Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves\r\n          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions\r\n          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and\r\n          worn.\r\n          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the\r\n          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to\r\n          some dried leaves.\r\n\r\n          8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8\r\n\r\n          HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed\r\n          in furs.\r\n          HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a\r\n          mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          What's wrong? Are you hurt?\r\n          She keeps swirling her spoon.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          You were half asleep.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I'll do better next time.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          German.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          (In German w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          I'll do better next time.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Italian.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          (In Italian w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          I'll do better next time.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Spanish.\r\n          HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INSISTENT)\r\n          Spanish.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          (In Spanish w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          Did you really want me to snap your\r\n          neck?\r\n          He looks at her - drops the quiz.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          How much did you pull off the deer?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          A hundred and twenty with scraps.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          About 200 pounds in total?\r\n          HANNA nods.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          That explains it.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          How you beat me.

LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9\r\n\r\n          HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads\r\n          to her from an old encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          The Great Blue Whale is the largest\r\n          animal to have ever existed.

HANNA speaks fast, reciting.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I live in Leipzig. German city.\r\n          Population 0.7 Million people. We\r\n          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I\r\n          go to school at the Klaus Kohle\r\n          Gymnasium and my best friends are\r\n          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I\r\n          like literature and sport, in\r\n          particular tennis and athletics. I\r\n          have a dog called Trudi.\r\n\r\n          16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16\r\n\r\n          HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost\r\n          anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.\r\n\r\n          17 EXT. RIVER - DAY. 17\r\n\r\n          HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the\r\n          fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.\r\n          They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs\r\n          bursting.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Don't give up! Don't give up!\r\n          HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she\r\n          screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is\r\n          pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in\r\n          darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the\r\n          surface with a gasp of relief.\r\n\r\n          18 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK. 18\r\n\r\n          On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but\r\n          moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I didn't need your help.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          9.\r\n          Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares\r\n          after her.\r\n\r\n          19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19\r\n\r\n          Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to\r\n          catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.\r\n\r\n          20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20\r\n\r\n          HANNA is asleep.\r\n          ERIK enters the room.\r\n          ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and\r\n          aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.\r\n          Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol\r\n          from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She\r\n          grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,\r\n          eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I'm ready now.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Maybe.\r\n          ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.\r\n          He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be\r\n          really trying to hurt her.\r\n          But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint\r\n          knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his\r\n          neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and\r\n          silence. HANNA breathless, angry.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          You didn't tell me you had a knife.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You told me to think for myself.\r\n          Isn't that what you want?\r\n          She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just\r\n          stares at her.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          I want to see things. I can't stay\r\n          here forever.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          10.\r\n\r\n          21 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21\r\n\r\n          ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.\r\n          He counts his paces.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          One, two, three, four...\r\n\r\n          22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22\r\n\r\n          ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.\r\n          Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from\r\n          the previous scene.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (V.O.)\r\n          ...five, six, seven, eight...\r\n\r\n          23 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          ...nine, ten.\r\n          After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the\r\n          tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.\r\n          We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of\r\n          HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All\r\n          the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.\r\n          After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to\r\n          his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the\r\n          frozen earth.\r\n\r\n          24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24\r\n\r\n          HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,\r\n          eating a hunk of cold meat.\r\n          She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree\r\n          line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her\r\n          breakfast.\r\n          The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...\r\n          come on... come and share my\r\n          breakfast.\r\n          The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,\r\n          withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward\r\n          carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          11.\r\n          As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA\r\n          expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they\r\n          seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this\r\n          before.\r\n          Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,\r\n          HANNA looks up too.\r\n          An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into\r\n          the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through\r\n          the forest.\r\n          HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and\r\n          dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane\r\n          roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,\r\n          oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.\r\n          It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S\r\n          isolation.\r\n\r\n          25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25\r\n\r\n          HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively\r\n          with his back to the door.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Did you see it? Wasn't it\r\n          beautiful, like thunder. I had to\r\n          stick my fingers in my ears it was\r\n          so loud. Did you hear it?\r\n          She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          What's wrong?\r\n          Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen\r\n          dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.\r\n          HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          What does it do?\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          It tells Marissa Wiegler where we\r\n          are.\r\n          He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          When you want to leave here all you\r\n          have to do is flip that switch.\r\n          She approaches the box and places a single finger on the\r\n          small red switch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          12.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          But once it's done, there'll be no\r\n          going back. She'll never give up\r\n          until you're dead, or she is. You\r\n          understand? I wont be there to hold\r\n          your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's\r\n          what you really want.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You're not scaring me.\r\n          He looks at her disbelievingly.\r\n          She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away\r\n          from the switch.\r\n          He softens towards her.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          It's here. There's no rush. Take\r\n          your time.\r\n          HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking\r\n          another look at it over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n          26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26\r\n\r\n          HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from\r\n          the encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Laika, a mongrel dog from the\r\n          streets of Moscow, was the first\r\n          animal to orbit the Earth. She was\r\n          launched into outer space on the\r\n          third of November, 1957.\r\n          Scientists believed humans would be\r\n          unable to survive conditions of\r\n          outer space, so flights by animals\r\n          were viewed as an experimental\r\n          precursor to human missions. Her\r\n          rocket was not designed to be\r\n          retrievable, and Laika had always\r\n          been intended to die.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          That's sad.\r\n          ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          When a star collapses the supernova\r\n          explosion is 10 billion times\r\n          brighter than other stars.\r\n          HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that\r\n          might be.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          13.\r\n\r\n          27 INT.

CONT. 76\r\n\r\n          MILITARY PERSONNEL reach the intersection close to HANNA and\r\n          spread out, all going in different directions but none coming\r\n          towards her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          30.\r\n          The last pair of personnel start heading towards her. She\r\n          looks up at the duct again and a length of ducting along the\r\n          wall, about waist height.\r\n          She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent.\r\n          She fiddles with the vent, eventually opening it as the\r\n          personnel are almost upon her.\r\n\r\n          77 INT.

CONT. 80\r\n\r\n          HANNA is sweating, exhausted, blinking in the darkness,\r\n          trying to make out what the light source is.\r\n          The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide\r\n          backwards on the smooth metal surface. She digs her fingers\r\n          into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying\r\n          to get a purchase.\r\n          She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest. She\r\n          rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and\r\n          immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,\r\n          falling down a long chute into the blackness. She has no idea\r\n          where she is or what's happening, but she's covering a lot of\r\n          ground.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          31.\r\n          She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out.\r\n          When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the end\r\n          light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of\r\n          manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever\r\n          and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives\r\n          way and light floods in, blinding her.\r\n          HANNA recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into:\r\n\r\n          81 EXT. MOROCCO/DESERT. CONT. 81\r\n\r\n          BLAZING SUN - HANNA's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut.\r\n          Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle\r\n          of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total\r\n          silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It\r\n          takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.\r\n          Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.\r\n          After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to\r\n          see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the\r\n          distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards\r\n          her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly\r\n          ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.\r\n\r\n          82 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT 82\r\n\r\n          In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for\r\n          HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for\r\n          miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.\r\n\r\n          MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)\r\n          473 are you receiving me? Can you\r\n          confirm your position. Subject has\r\n          escaped.\r\n\r\n          83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83\r\n\r\n          The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.\r\n          Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right\r\n          over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle\r\n          crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.\r\n          One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes\r\n          over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.\r\n          The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.\r\n\r\n                         MILITARY VOICE\r\n          Can you confirm your position 473?\r\n          Banks? Banks can you hear me?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n          Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a\r\n          pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that.\r\n          He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.\r\n          Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the\r\n          radio.\r\n\r\n          BANKS.\r\n          I'm at a perimeter opening at the\r\n          far east wing. Something's not\r\n          quite right...\r\n          He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-\r\n          conditioning duct is empty.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,\r\n          hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the\r\n          oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor\r\n          flashing beneath her.\r\n          The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.\r\n          HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches\r\n          her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the\r\n          jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.\r\n          HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she\r\n          slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as\r\n          the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and\r\n          looks around herself. She has no conception of this\r\n          landscape, no idea where she might be.\r\n\r\n          84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84\r\n\r\n          MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing\r\n          clothes, underwear, another power suit.\r\n          Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls\r\n          aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the\r\n          security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the\r\n          safe Marissa retrieves a blue file.\r\n          MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters:\r\n\r\n          GALINKA.\r\n\r\n          85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85\r\n\r\n          FLASHBACK to 1995.\r\n          A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a\r\n          deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small\r\n          detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses\r\n          it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n          There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road\r\n          and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.\r\n          MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks\r\n          through binoculars at the car.\r\n          She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.\r\n          JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the\r\n          head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA\r\n          stops dead.\r\n          Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger\r\n          ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in\r\n          his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.\r\n          MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to\r\n          her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement\r\n          and throws himself to the ground.\r\n          Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK\r\n          and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER\r\n          grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,\r\n          MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives\r\n          into the forest.\r\n\r\n          86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86\r\n\r\n\r\n          PRESENT DAY.\r\n          MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire\r\n          to the file in the sink.\r\n          When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal\r\n          and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish\r\n          mop.\r\n\r\n          87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87\r\n\r\n          The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are\r\n          longer, but the heat is still intense.\r\n          HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes\r\n          scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a\r\n          growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless\r\n          sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea\r\n          where she might be.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n\r\n                         (MUTTERING)\r\n          I live in Leipzig.

A shadow\r\n          falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a\r\n          GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.\r\n          HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.\r\n          The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age\r\n          but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and\r\n          bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this\r\n          perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe\r\n          in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where\r\n          she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Hello.\r\n          HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite\r\n          direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks\r\n          in the distance.\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          All right?\r\n          HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't you speak English?\r\n          HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          That can't be helped. You look\r\n          terrible.\r\n          At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,\r\n          rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand\r\n          is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA\r\n          while talking to SOPHIE.\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          Who's she?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          I don't know.

I'm busy.\r\n          MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD\r\n          instinctively does as he's told.\r\n\r\n          LEWIS (O.O.V)\r\n          You know this isn't going to go\r\n          away.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I'm dealing with it Lewis.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          37.\r\n\r\n          LEWIS (O.O.V)\r\n          Okay but I just want you to admit -\r\n          my Lord - how did she know to ask\r\n          for you?\r\n          She hangs up.\r\n\r\n          89 EXT. DESERT/OASIS TOWN - DUSK 89\r\n\r\n          HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,\r\n          approaching a dusty oasis town.\r\n          HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,\r\n          taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,\r\n          assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous\r\n          cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody\r\n          and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens\r\n          to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to\r\n          every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly\r\n          exotic and visceral to her.\r\n          An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA\r\n          stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.\r\n          She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen\r\n          before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna\r\n          finds bizarre and hilarious.\r\n\r\n          90 INT. CENTRE OF TOWN/NIGHT MARKET - EVENING 90\r\n\r\n          HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses\r\n          some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the\r\n          stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new\r\n          clothes.\r\n          HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of\r\n          cherries.\r\n          She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels\r\n          and cheap jewellery stores.\r\n          He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.\r\n          HANNA looks up at the hotel, then enters.\r\n\r\n          91 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING 91\r\n\r\n          HANNA stands at the reception desk. A kindly looking HOTEL\r\n          OWNER is eating a jammy biscuit. He's a little confused by\r\n\r\n          HANNA.\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          Where's your family?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Are you Arab?\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          I'm Moroccan.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Morocco.

MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92\r\n\r\n          The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel\r\n          room with twin beds.\r\n          They speak in Arabic with English subtitles.\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          It's the best we've got.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Thank you.\r\n          HANNA stares at the light switch.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you have one of these in every\r\n          room?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          Of course. All mod cons.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          It's electricity?\r\n          The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          Yes.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I know a little bit about\r\n          electricity. They say Edison\r\n          discovered it, or was it Franklin?\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          Some American, I'm sure.\r\n          He picks up an electric kettle.\r\n\r\n          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)\r\n          Electric kettle for the English -\r\n          they like to make their own tea.\r\n          He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.\r\n          He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a\r\n          fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is\r\n          fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on\r\n          the edge of the bed.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          What is it?\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL OWNER\r\n          It's the best we can do.\r\n          She stares at the picture, bemused.\r\n\r\n          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)\r\n          Where do you come from?\r\n          Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          The forest.\r\n          The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this\r\n          strange encounter, and leaves.\r\n          She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to\r\n          increase.\r\n          Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours\r\n          from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle\r\n          violently.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n          HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She\r\n          tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but\r\n          it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries\r\n          another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing\r\n          HANNA even more.\r\n          On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,\r\n          the sound of gunfire.\r\n          The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air\r\n          like a helicopter.\r\n          A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.\r\n          Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.\r\n          HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls\r\n          through the bathroom door straight into the shower,\r\n          inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.\r\n          HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if\r\n          it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.\r\n          In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,\r\n          the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone\r\n          still shouting.\r\n          HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the\r\n          handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls\r\n          through the door and into the corridor.\r\n\r\n          93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93\r\n\r\n          Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her\r\n          breath.\r\n          A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from\r\n          their bedroom.\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          Look. It's that girl.\r\n          He nudges SOPHIE.\r\n          HANNA eyes them suspiciously.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Hey you made it.\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          Hey, again.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Did you walk here?\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          She looks different.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Do you want to hang with us?\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          Are you hungry?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Miles is always hungry.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I'm thirsty.\r\n\r\n          94 EXT/INT. STRIP CLUB. HAMBURG. 94\r\n\r\n          The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light\r\n          district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of\r\n          a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the\r\n          road. She is on the phone and we hear.\r\n\r\n          LEWIS (O.S.)\r\n          The Swedish borders are sealed. I\r\n          have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish\r\n          border patrols on high alert and\r\n          Interpol have briefed the police.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I don't want any bad news Lewis.\r\n          Neither of us can afford a fuck up.\r\n          MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is\r\n          now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons\r\n          are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.\r\n          At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,\r\n          MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven\r\n          and drinking a scotch.\r\n          ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          I didn't think they let women in\r\n          here.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          They let them in, they just don't\r\n          let them get dressed.\r\n          He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          Still drinking on the job.

OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95\r\n\r\n          HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all\r\n          eating falafel while HANNA eats meat.\r\n          SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some\r\n          difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong\r\n          to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities\r\n          have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to\r\n          assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to\r\n          their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.\r\n          SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she\r\n          picks at her food.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          She's beautiful. I wish I had a\r\n          body like hers. She's really cool\r\n          too.

SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96\r\n\r\n          ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a\r\n          tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the\r\n          counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following\r\n          him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on\r\n          the counter.\r\n\r\n                         HELLER\r\n          Three pounds of goose fat if you\r\n          please.\r\n\r\n          97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97\r\n\r\n          HANNA arrives back at the hotel with RACHEL, SEB, MILES and\r\n          SOPHIE. MILES is sleepy and SOPHIE a little grumpy.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Why do we always have to get up so\r\n          early?\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          If you were a Berber shepherd -\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          - I'm not a shepherd.

Come on we'll do it\r\n          together.\r\n          HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S\r\n          door closing.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          She's weird. Is it me, or is that\r\n          girl weird?\r\n\r\n          98 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT 98\r\n\r\n          The TV flickers illuminating HANNA as she sits on her bed\r\n          looking at the DNA report folded up into a tight wad. She\r\n          smooths it out and reads.\r\n          The test reads: HANNA HELLER - \u00e2\u0080\u009cSGM + test results.\r\n          Interfering sequence present. Abnormal.

The sheer mass of\r\n          humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the volume and hears the\r\n          call to prayer.\r\n          She listens in wonder to her first experience of music.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERS)\r\n          Music. A combination of sounds with\r\n          a view to beauty of form and\r\n          expression of emotion.\r\n          She breathes in the beautiful sounds.\r\n\r\n          99 EXT.

HELLER\r\n          arrives. He has a rucksack on his back.\r\n          HELLER undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he\r\n          knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on\r\n          his back.\r\n          Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he\r\n          bought in the butcher's. He stares across the water towards\r\n          DENMARK in the distance.\r\n\r\n          100 EXT. HOTEL CAR PARK. - PRE-DAWN 100\r\n\r\n          HANNA appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the\r\n          car park looking for the family van.\r\n          When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked.\r\n          She tries the back door but that's also locked.\r\n          She gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a\r\n          doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof.\r\n\r\n          101 EXT. VAN/ROOF - PRE-DAWN 101\r\n\r\n          She studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle. It has\r\n          been left open a few inches for air.\r\n          She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open\r\n          further but it's mechanised and won't budge.\r\n          She looks around the car park for an implement.\r\n          She spies a fire escape with a caretaker's nook next to it.\r\n          She climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretaker's\r\n          room.\r\n\r\n          102 INT. CARETAKER'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN 102\r\n\r\n          HANNA searches the tiny office until she finds a crowbar.\r\n\r\n          103 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO. DAY 103\r\n\r\n          A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions.\r\n          ISAACS looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His\r\n          men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.\r\n          ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD. The GUARD is looking at a\r\n          photocopied photo of HANNA from her holding cell. The GUARD\r\n          pockets the photocopy as ISAACS passes him a wad of cash.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          48.\r\n\r\n          104 INT. VAN - DAY. 104\r\n\r\n          THE FAMILY travels towards the ferry-port, sleepy and grumpy,\r\n          yawning, looking around.\r\n          The sun roof to the rear, above the breakfast table and bench\r\n          seats, is wide open.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          ...

FERRYPORT. MOROCCO - CONTINUOUS 105\r\n\r\n          ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry\r\n          from behind his dark glasses.\r\n          He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are\r\n          having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He\r\n          scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.\r\n\r\n          106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106\r\n\r\n          Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns\r\n          blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -\r\n          it's chaos.\r\n          SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the\r\n          while.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          Typical.

The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          49.\r\n\r\n          107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107\r\n\r\n          Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats\r\n          around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened\r\n          out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -\r\n          inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently\r\n          hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.\r\n          HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its\r\n          locked.\r\n          She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,\r\n          the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.\r\n          She climbs out.\r\n\r\n          108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108\r\n\r\n          HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it\r\n          takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks\r\n          over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.\r\n          A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.\r\n          SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          What has got into you? Oh my God,\r\n          look over there.\r\n          They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          It's her.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          You think she... you don't think\r\n          she...

UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109\r\n\r\n          ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other\r\n          side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the\r\n          opposite deck.\r\n          A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied\r\n          photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are\r\n          blown along the deck.\r\n          ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.\r\n\r\n          110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110\r\n\r\n          HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE\r\n          offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Would you like some?\r\n          HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Please.\r\n          She tries it.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          It tastes like music.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          You're so weird, aren't you? Did\r\n          you have a fight with your dad or\r\n          something?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Yes.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Was it bad?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          No. I won.\r\n          HANNA studies the sea.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Can you help me get home?\r\n          At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA\r\n          rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.\r\n          HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly\r\n          pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she\r\n          shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          You could do me a make-over if you\r\n          like?\r\n\r\n          111 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 111\r\n\r\n          MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive\r\n          the stationary van.\r\n          Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a\r\n          heated discussion.\r\n          In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          You're pretty. You know that?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Am I?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Of course you are. You've got\r\n          pretty eyes and you're tall. I\r\n          always wanted to be tall. If I were\r\n          a man I might fancy you.\r\n          She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I'm not a man.\r\n          SOPHIE laughs even more.\r\n          The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,\r\n          nervous but determined.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          53.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          Okay, here's the deal. We're going\r\n          to find a way to get you home just\r\n          as soon as we get off this crate.\r\n          But since you don't have a passport\r\n          with you right now, we're just\r\n          going to have to be a bit gorilla.\r\n          Okay?\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          We passionately believe it's the\r\n          right thing to do.\r\n          They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round\r\n          HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly\r\n          embarrassed.\r\n\r\n          112 EXT. FERRY PORT ALGECIRAS - DAY 112\r\n\r\n          The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are\r\n          starting to drive out, halting on the dock to have passports\r\n          checked.\r\n\r\n          113 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 113\r\n\r\n          Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to\r\n          disembark.\r\n          RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back\r\n          stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a\r\n          place for HANNA to hide.\r\n          HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.\r\n          On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches\r\n          him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She\r\n          ducks down a little further.\r\n          RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          You okay honey?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Yes yes I'm ready!\r\n          ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry\r\n          gates are open and the noise subsides.\r\n          SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          Oh Jesus.\r\n          HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling\r\n          cushions aside and gets into the compartment.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n          SEB grits his teeth.\r\n\r\n          SEB (CONT'D)\r\n          Here goes nothing.\r\n          He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions\r\n          just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.\r\n          SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He\r\n          passes ISAACS on his way round.\r\n\r\n          SEB (CONT'D)\r\n          Excuse me. Sir?\r\n          ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front\r\n          passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her\r\n          mirrors.\r\n          SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea\r\n          who he is.\r\n\r\n          INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -\r\n          HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She\r\n          listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry.\r\n\r\n          114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114\r\n\r\n          Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.\r\n          A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the\r\n          deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with\r\n          the exertion. Water dripping from his body.\r\n          He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He\r\n          approaches the beach car park.\r\n          A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.\r\n          ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on\r\n          him.\r\n          He stops and turns towards the police car.\r\n          TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He\r\n          watches them very carefully.\r\n\r\n          115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115\r\n\r\n          The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of\r\n          Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n          116 INT. VAN - DAY 116\r\n\r\n          HANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged\r\n          landscape.\r\n          Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold\r\n          evening light.\r\n          HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and\r\n          brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a\r\n          little water spills down his front.\r\n          SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE\r\n          takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's.\r\n\r\n          117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117\r\n\r\n          ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY\r\n          OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we\r\n          have a situation here...\r\n\r\n          118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118\r\n\r\n          ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a\r\n          number of scenes with no luck until he notices:\r\n          The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and\r\n          boarding the van.\r\n\r\n          119 INT. VAN - DAY 119\r\n\r\n          HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the\r\n          first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and\r\n          they stare at the huge, granite mountain range...\r\n          She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's\r\n          shoulder.\r\n\r\n          120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120\r\n\r\n          MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She\r\n          approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two\r\n          DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats\r\n          freshly sliced.\r\n\r\n                         LEWIS\r\n          The Danish authorities are taking\r\n          this very seriously. They've\r\n          doubled the number of officers on\r\n          the ground. We've sent up spotter\r\n          planes over the channel.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n\r\n                         LEWIS (CONT'D)\r\n          They're appealing for witnesses\r\n          through the local media...\r\n          MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The\r\n          reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.\r\n\r\n          LEWIS (CONT'D)\r\n          You think he really swam it?\r\n          MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she\r\n          walks away.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Keep me posted.\r\n\r\n          121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121\r\n\r\n          The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN\r\n          CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a\r\n          shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,\r\n          borders and rules. Families come here from cities across\r\n          Europe and bring their whole lives with them.\r\n          The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family\r\n          walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious\r\n          looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.\r\n          SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.\r\n\r\n          GERMAN CAMPER.\r\n          Guten tag.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Guten Morgen.\r\n\r\n          GERMAN CAMPER.\r\n          Wie geht es Ihnen?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Gutm und Ihnen?\r\n\r\n          GERMAN CAMPER.\r\n          Jah, gut, gut...\r\n          A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.\r\n\r\n          FRENCH CAMPER.\r\n          Bonjour. Ca va?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Ca va. Oui. Bien...\r\n          HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's\r\n          tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties\r\n          complicated knots.\r\n          RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          57.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Maybe we could all go for a walk\r\n          when we've put the tent up.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          No thanks.\r\n          HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a\r\n          couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.\r\n\r\n          122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122\r\n\r\n          HANNA turns a display unit of postcards.\r\n          Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE\r\n\r\n          BOYS.\r\n          One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he\r\n          passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S\r\n          not used to this feeling of being looked at.\r\n          While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a\r\n          postcard and a book of stamps.\r\n\r\n          123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123\r\n\r\n          HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mission accomplished'\r\n          HANNA gets up and posts the card.\r\n\r\n          124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124\r\n\r\n          RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above\r\n          them the evening chorus is in full song.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          I just feel connected when I'm in\r\n          the countryside. The city stifles\r\n          me... emotionally, creatively.\r\n          HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in\r\n          the undergrowth.\r\n\r\n          RACHEL (CONT'D)\r\n          Anyway, I was very young when I...\r\n          Seb and I.... He was so impressive.\r\n          HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.\r\n\r\n          RACHEL (CONT'D)\r\n          Hanna?!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          58.\r\n\r\n          125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125\r\n\r\n          The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred\r\n          veggie sausages.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          It's probably just a bunch of\r\n          Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly\r\n          going to be out all night.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          You're not going, Sophie. No way,\r\n          Jose.\r\n          HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.\r\n          She lays them in front of the family.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Food.\r\n          SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and\r\n          RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might\r\n          be.\r\n\r\n                         MILES\r\n          That's gross.\r\n\r\n          126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126\r\n\r\n          The girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does\r\n          HANNA'S make-up.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          I don't know why I'm doing this,\r\n          you're going to steal all the best\r\n          men off of me.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          What do you mean?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Though quite frankly I don't need\r\n          more digits than I've got right\r\n          now. Loads. Loads and loads.\r\n          HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She\r\n          licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't\r\n          look right on her.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          It's like paint.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Don't lick it off.\r\n          SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          59.\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          You're gorgeous.\r\n\r\n          127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move\r\n          secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of\r\n          SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,\r\n          SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I can't walk in this.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          You look hot.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Where are we going?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Shhhhh!\r\n          HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Says who?\r\n          SOPHIE heads off down the road.\r\n          HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to\r\n          catch up with SOPHIE.\r\n\r\n          128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128\r\n\r\n          A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.\r\n          SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking\r\n          down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the\r\n          abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and\r\n          electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.\r\n          Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA\r\n          stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's\r\n          forced to mime and shout her order over the music.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Vodka. Two.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          60.\r\n          The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of\r\n          water.\r\n\r\n                         BARTENDER\r\n          Water only. No booze.\r\n          Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY\r\n          from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is\r\n          staring at her again.\r\n          SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to\r\n\r\n          HANNA.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          What do they call this music?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Banging.\r\n          HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -\r\n          SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.\r\n          HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They\r\n          split up and start to survey the crowd.\r\n          Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking\r\n          place.\r\n          ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,\r\n          thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          What you got?\r\n\r\n                         DEALER\r\n          (in Spanish w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          Nothing man. That guys just a\r\n          friend.\r\n          ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER\r\n          against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash\r\n          of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white\r\n          powder.\r\n          ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.\r\n\r\n          DEALER (CONT'D)\r\n          (in Spanish w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          Hey, you're not police. What the\r\n          fuck?\r\n          ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          61.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Ssh.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple\r\n          of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.\r\n\r\n                         SPANISH BOY\r\n          (in Spanish w/ English\r\n\r\n                         SUBTITLES)\r\n          Where are you from?\r\n          The girls just look at each other.\r\n\r\n          SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)\r\n          English? American? You like to\r\n          party?\r\n          They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and\r\n          leads HANNA away.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Will you teach me to do dancing?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          It's easy.\r\n          HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to\r\n          dance.\r\n          HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her\r\n          arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a\r\n          field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and\r\n          expressive.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies\r\n          around him greedily.\r\n          He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his\r\n          gums.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.\r\n          FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.\r\n          THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating\r\n          their way in.\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          He's after you.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          How can you tell?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          62.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Duh, look at the way he's looking\r\n          at you. He's gorgeous.\r\n          FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking\r\n          either.\r\n\r\n          FELICIANO'S FRIEND\r\n          What's your name?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Sophie.\r\n\r\n          FELICIANO'S FRIEND\r\n          Have you come here before?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          All the time.\r\n\r\n          FELICIANO'S FRIEND\r\n          Really? You dance well.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          So do you.\r\n          HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.\r\n          The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent\r\n          flashes of a strobe light.\r\n          HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their\r\n          movements caught in still flashes.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and\r\n          starts to move through the crowds towards her.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and\r\n          laughs.\r\n          The crowd is jumping.\r\n          HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a\r\n          moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still\r\n          locked.\r\n          ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the\r\n          strobe lighting.\r\n          HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.\r\n          His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.\r\n          He draws her face towards his.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          63.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Are we going to kiss now?\r\n\r\n                         FELICIANO\r\n          Would you like to?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Kissing requires a total of thirty-\r\n          four facial muscles.\r\n          Their lips are almost touching.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          The most important muscle involved\r\n          is the orbicularis oris muscle,\r\n          which is used to pucker the lips -\r\n          He kisses her.\r\n          HANNA closes her eyes.\r\n          ISAACS moves in.\r\n          FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her\r\n          waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with\r\n          his.\r\n          HANNA snaps.\r\n          In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws\r\n          him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee\r\n          on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.\r\n          SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the\r\n          closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.\r\n          ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Hanna! Holy crap...\r\n\r\n                         FELICIANO\r\n          Please, don't hurt me.\r\n\r\n                         (TO SOPHIE)\r\n          Please, tell your friend...\r\n          HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the\r\n          ground she doesn't know what to do with him.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Should I let him go?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          As opposed to what? Yes, you should\r\n          let him go.\r\n          HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          64.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I'm going to go now.\r\n\r\n                         FELICIANO\r\n          Sure.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          It was nice.\r\n          And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.\r\n          ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls\r\n          among the mass of dancing bodies.\r\n          HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the\r\n          exit.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you\r\n          were going to kill him.

Her\r\n          actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the\r\n          destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA.\r\n          The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her.\r\n          She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare\r\n          bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every\r\n          available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and\r\n          photographs relating JOANNA'S murder.\r\n          On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She\r\n          stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Joanna no.\r\n\r\n          24'.\r\n\r\n          133 INT.

DAY. 138\r\n\r\n          A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the\r\n          morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He\r\n          looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n          POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching\r\n          HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A\r\n          DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.\r\n          On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the\r\n          ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a\r\n          commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not\r\n          right.\r\n          He moves off and enters a small bar.\r\n          The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,\r\n          the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.\r\n          HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE\r\n          EXIT and walks out through it.\r\n\r\n          139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139\r\n\r\n          HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train\r\n          station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and\r\n          apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself\r\n          behind a skip of empty bottles.\r\n          As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the\r\n          corner into the goods yard.\r\n          From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after\r\n          signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.\r\n          The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer\r\n          to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his\r\n          hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee\r\n          in the groin of another.\r\n          There's a brief exchange of blows.\r\n          One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.\r\n          HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the\r\n          man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.\r\n          He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground\r\n          squealing.\r\n          HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his\r\n\r\n          CELLPHONE.\r\n          HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a\r\n          shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.\r\n          He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.\r\n\r\n          140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140\r\n\r\n          The FAMILY van is making its way up through France.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          72.\r\n          Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his\r\n          HENCHMEN are biding their time.\r\n\r\n          141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141\r\n\r\n          RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat\r\n          keeping her entertained.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          ...they can live at freezing\r\n          temperatures for up to nine months\r\n          without food. Imagine that, nine\r\n          months.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Why do you know so much about\r\n          fleas?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I read it in my Encyclopaedia.\r\n          HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW\r\n          and frowns, she's seen it before.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Also, they can jump around 200\r\n          times their own body length, which\r\n          makes them the best jumpers of all\r\n          known animals except for the\r\n          froghopper. Now they can really\r\n          jump.\r\n          RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror\r\n          again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Everything all right?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I think so.\r\n          But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          Mama, I know you're disappointed in\r\n          me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama.\r\n          But I have found maybe a way to\r\n          make it better...\r\n\r\n          142 INT. HOTEL SUITE.

Her lips pulled back in a\r\n          snarl.\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          An American program. It's very\r\n          scientific. Important scientific\r\n          work.\r\n          Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and\r\n          presses fast forward. Then play -\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          Erik says he can get these tapes to\r\n\r\n                         YOU -\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n\r\n                         (MUTTERS)\r\n          Bastard.\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          - He says I look beautiful. I don't\r\n          feel beautiful...\r\n          MARISSA doesn't care, fast forwards. Play -\r\n\r\n          JOHANNA (V.O.)\r\n          ...I'm not sure if it's true that\r\n          the baby can hear, but at night I\r\n          sing. I hope it hears me.\r\n          MARISSA listens, for some unknown reason to MARISSA this\r\n          catches her imagination.\r\n          The phone rings.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         RECEPTIONIST\r\n          Frau Wiegler, this is reception.

PARK. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 143\r\n\r\n          A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as\r\n          icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he\r\n          stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding\r\n          profusely.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Well, here we are.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          How did you know I was here?\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          I killed one of your men. Got his\r\n          cellphone. You've gotten soft.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (O.S.)\r\n          No, I just grew up.

COPENHAGEN - CONTINUOUS 144\r\n\r\n          MARISSA stops, taken aback by the question.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          No, I made choices.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Hanna's practically yours, you\r\n          know?\r\n          This goes straight to an ache that's been building in\r\n\r\n          MARISSA.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Not interested.\r\n          But she is.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          She's true and good and funny.\r\n          Yeah, she's funny.

MARISSA puts the phone down and sits\r\n          quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape\r\n          machine.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          Was it like this for you, Mama? I\r\n          think I know what the baby looks\r\n          like. I think it's a girl -- I hope\r\n          so.\r\n\r\n          145 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - NIGHT 145\r\n\r\n          The FAMILY'S van drives - behind ISAACS BMW tails it, lights\r\n          on high beam.\r\n\r\n          JOANNA (V.O.)\r\n          I wonder who she'll be? I hope\r\n          she's smart. I hope she's a\r\n          stronger person than I am.\r\n\r\n          146 INT. VAN - NIGHT 146\r\n\r\n          HANNA sits beside her in the passenger seat, her anxiety\r\n          growing.\r\n          RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights\r\n          behind.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think\r\n          we're lost, Hanna.\r\n          HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.\r\n          She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.\r\n          She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably\r\n          asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.\r\n\r\n          RACHEL (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm going to pull over.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          No, don't.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          I need to check the map.\r\n\r\n          147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147\r\n\r\n          The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.\r\n          RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls\r\n          in behind the van.\r\n          On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The\r\n          containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's\r\n          building blocks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Why won't that car pass? He has his\r\n          lights on high beam, I was doing\r\n          everything I could to get out of\r\n          the way...\r\n          SOPHIE wakes up in the back.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Are we stopped? I need to pee.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Well, I don't want you going too\r\n          far right now.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I think you should stay where you\r\n          are, Sophie.\r\n          HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the\r\n          silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and\r\n          neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make\r\n          the first move.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake\r\n          up.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Please.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          This is creepy.

But you really mustn't\r\n          get out of the van.\r\n          HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to\r\n\r\n          SOPHIE.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          What ever you do, don't follow me.\r\n          Promise not to follow me.\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          I promise.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Hanna, tell me what's going on or\r\n          Seb will go over to that car and\r\n          find out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n                         SEB\r\n          Like fuck I will. Everyone stay\r\n          put. Where's my phone?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n\r\n                         (TO SOPHIE)\r\n          Thank you for being my friend.\r\n          HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car\r\n          doors open.\r\n          In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts\r\n          from the van.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Hanna!\r\n          RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.\r\n          The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his\r\n          gun at her head. RACHEL screams.\r\n\r\n          148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148\r\n\r\n          HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative\r\n          safety of the container park.\r\n          ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.\r\n          HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.\r\n          ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He\r\n          signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.\r\n          HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way\r\n          and that.\r\n          ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.\r\n\r\n          ISAACS (O.S.)\r\n          Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You\r\n          need to come with me now. I know\r\n          where your papa is.\r\n          She listens.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.\r\n\r\n          ISAACS (CONT'D)\r\n          He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He\r\n          misses you.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double-\r\n          kicks him in the chest.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and\r\n          scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the\r\n          containers when she reaches a gap.\r\n          The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.\r\n          A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up\r\n          higher, now four containers high.\r\n          ISAACS follow below.\r\n          HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right\r\n          over the head of ISAACS.\r\n          HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the\r\n          containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then\r\n          pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to\r\n          land on a lower container on the other side.\r\n          HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the\r\n          HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench\r\n          and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the\r\n          head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.\r\n          She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to\r\n          the ground.\r\n          She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the\r\n          containers. She stops at a \u00e2\u0080\u0098T' junction, unsure which way to\r\n          go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN\r\n          ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the\r\n          third.\r\n          She's trapped.\r\n\r\n          ISAACS (CONT'D)\r\n          Just take it easy.\r\n          HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.\r\n          He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.\r\n          She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he\r\n          crashes to the ground.\r\n          She rolls and springs to her feet.\r\n          The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.\r\n\r\n          149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149\r\n\r\n          HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through\r\n          a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of\r\n          waste.\r\n          HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the\r\n          scrap metal is unloaded.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          79.\r\n          A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and\r\n          lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a\r\n          tarpaulin.\r\n\r\n          150 INT. HOLDING CELLS.

Between ERIK and JOANNA is a\r\n          clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to\r\n          understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER.

ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157\r\n\r\n          HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from\r\n          an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel\r\n          works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.\r\n          HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal\r\n          playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge\r\n          fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and\r\n          abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by\r\n          a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous\r\n          angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.\r\n          The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fun House'.\r\n          It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its\r\n          roof.\r\n          HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She\r\n          walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and\r\n          knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there\r\n          being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and\r\n          peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of\r\n          work clown.\r\n\r\n                         KNEPFLER\r\n          Excuse me young lady?\r\n          It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older.

He stops to look at\r\n          her.\r\n\r\n                         KNEPFLER\r\n          So you are Hanna.\r\n          He puts out his hand to shake.\r\n\r\n          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)\r\n          It's very nice to meet you, Hanna.\r\n          HANNA smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already.\r\n          KNEPFLER studies her, quietly moved by his memories.\r\n\r\n          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)\r\n          My real name is Knepfler.

He will be here\r\n          soon.\r\n          HANNA stares, not quite believing.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          85.\r\n          HANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through.\r\n          KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a\r\n          spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down\r\n          kitchen.\r\n\r\n          159 INT.

WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 164\r\n\r\n          The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room,\r\n          the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the\r\n          room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are\r\n          in sight, nothing else.\r\n          The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress\r\n          compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes\r\n          as she hears her call.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Lewis. It's Marissa.\r\n          HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she\r\n          had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          You got anything? He's coming here.\r\n          I can smell it. Double the men.\r\n          But, Lewis, I want to talk to him.\r\n          HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the\r\n          room. Male. ISAACS.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used\r\n          to send Heller's things from Berlin\r\n          before the Communists were kicked\r\n          out of Prague.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          How much does he know about the\r\n          programme?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Everything. He knew Johanna.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          What does he know about the child?\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          He also thinks Erik's the father.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Well that's good.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Everybody thinks Erik's her father.\r\n          Erik probably thinks he's her\r\n          father.\r\n          They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely\r\n          control her breath.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him\r\n          yet?\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Let's see what else Knepfler has to\r\n          offer.\r\n          He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she\r\n          hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under\r\n          the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.\r\n          MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.\r\n          They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-\r\n          air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.\r\n          Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a\r\n          window.\r\n\r\n          165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165\r\n\r\n          HANNA lands having jumped from the window.\r\n          She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at\r\n          the front of the house, she runs for dear life.\r\n\r\n          166 EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 166\r\n\r\n          HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?\r\n          She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing\r\n          where she is going. Her world turned upside down. She sees an\r\n          internet cafe. Ducks into it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n          167 INT.

It contains\r\n          Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          How does it work?\r\n\r\n                         OWNER\r\n          You've never used the internet?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          No.\r\n          He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings\r\n          up a search engine.\r\n\r\n                         OWNER\r\n          Just type whatever it is you're\r\n          looking for here.\r\n          He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in\r\n\r\n          DNA INTERFERING SEQUENCE.\r\n\r\n          168 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK/WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 168\r\n\r\n          ERIK HELLER limps, head bowed, through the Amusement Park.\r\n          He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass\r\n          dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside\r\n          the house.\r\n          HELLER watches for a moment or two.\r\n          Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.\r\n          HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.\r\n          He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.\r\n          He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.\r\n          Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body\r\n          bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's\r\n          obviously dead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n          HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking\r\n          furiously. Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and\r\n          runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house.\r\n\r\n          169 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 169\r\n\r\n          HANNA sits at the computer, looking at the screen breathless\r\n          with tension.\r\n          Phrases from the text leap out at her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn interfering\r\n          sequence within the DNA\u00e2\u0080\u009d , \u00e2\u0080\u009cintervention to the mother's\r\n          uterus during pregnancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          HANNA stands in shock.

Then writes in her\r\n          mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.\r\n          Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA\r\n          stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is\r\n          an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger\r\n          Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. HANNA writes it\r\n          down. Gets up and leaves.\r\n\r\n          170 INT. TAXI. EAST BERLIN SUBURB - DAY 170\r\n\r\n          HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim\r\n          concrete jungle of old East German housing projects.\r\n          HANNA looks at the thousands of tiny windows, so many lives\r\n          being lived in unawareness. Is this normality? Is this the\r\n          world she longed to be a part of?\r\n\r\n          171 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM'S HOUSE.

She peers through.\r\n          On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA\r\n          sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood\r\n          splattered across the glass.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n          HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks\r\n          around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the\r\n          glass.\r\n\r\n          175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175\r\n\r\n          HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The\r\n          air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.\r\n          HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation\r\n          she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN\r\n          ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The\r\n          flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain\r\n          that spreads across the cheap lino floor.\r\n          HANNA steps back and gags.\r\n          She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and\r\n          goes through into the lounge.\r\n          The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving\r\n          pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by\r\n          MARISSA'S hunt for information.\r\n          HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a\r\n          tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.\r\n          The room had been turned into a home office, there are\r\n          newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and\r\n          photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall\r\n          space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the\r\n          truth behind her daughters murder.\r\n          HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will\r\n          help her understand who she is and where she came from.\r\n          Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (V.O.)\r\n          You won't find anything.\r\n          HANNA turns in shock.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Marissa would have been much too\r\n          careful for that.\r\n          HANNA stares at him.

The\r\n          science came from the old East\r\n          Germany. The money from the CIA.\r\n          The intention was to explore\r\n          whether small genetic changes could\r\n          be made to embryos... to improve\r\n\r\n                         THEM\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          95.\r\n\r\n          HANNA CONT'D)\r\n          Improve?\r\n          ERIK looks at her.

Anything that might make a\r\n          better soldier.\r\n          HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          How did you know about it?\r\n          ERIK's stares right at her.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          I worked for it.\r\n          She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his\r\n          pocket.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          This is what you were looking for.\r\n          HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to\r\n          participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of\r\n          arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995.\r\n          An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American\r\n          dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal\r\n          claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          I recruited your mother at an\r\n          abortion clinic in May 1994. She\r\n          was about to terminate an unwanted\r\n          pregnancy. Some boy at a disco.\r\n          HANNA looks at the paper in shock.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          I had recruited twenty women. She\r\n          was the last. She was different.\r\n          Two years later I heard the\r\n          programme was to be terminated.

She reaches to the window of the room\r\n          to get some air. She is reeling - faint.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hanna listen to me.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Keep away from me.\r\n          ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          It worked. You worked.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You mean I'm a killer?\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          No... no..\r\n          He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent\r\n          repulsion.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Don't touch me.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          We have a new identity for you. A\r\n          new life. A new beginning.\r\n          She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes\r\n          her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.\r\n\r\n          ERIK (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't.\r\n          She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight\r\n          in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps\r\n          and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending\r\n          himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers\r\n          him, has a knife to his throat.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Let me go.\r\n          He releases her. She goes to the door.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          I tried to prepare you for what\r\n          your life would be.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You didn't prepare me for this.\r\n          And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK\r\n          knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down\r\n          the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          97.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Hanna wait.\r\n          He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars\r\n          coming across the estate scrubland.\r\n          ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs\r\n          through the destroyed living room, and out through the front\r\n          door.\r\n\r\n                         176 176\r\n\r\n                         DAY\r\n          ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view\r\n          of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.\r\n\r\n          177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177\r\n\r\n          MARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight\r\n          into HANNA when suddenly...\r\n          MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.\r\n          She speaks to ISAACS.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          That's him.\r\n          And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly\r\n          away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars\r\n          in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.\r\n\r\n          178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178\r\n\r\n          HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible\r\n          athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers\r\n          for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking\r\n          to finish it off.\r\n          Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the\r\n          end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to\r\n          run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching\r\n          himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a\r\n          doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (O.C.)\r\n          Drop it.\r\n          MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.\r\n          There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER\r\n          drops his gun.\r\n          Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          98.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          So go ahead.\r\n          She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can\r\n          for him.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          You know I'll find her.\r\n\r\n                         ERIK\r\n          Don't under estimate what you\r\n          created.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          What we created, together.\r\n\r\n          179 EXT.

ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.\r\n          She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.\r\n          An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing\r\n          stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.\r\n          Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her\r\n          over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-\r\n          pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and\r\n          she is on board.\r\n\r\n          182 EXT. WASTELAND.

BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183\r\n\r\n          HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death,\r\n          bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare\r\n          at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her\r\n          pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik\r\n          showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.\r\n          Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.\r\n          HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was\r\n          born. She must find out who she is.\r\n\r\n          184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184\r\n\r\n          MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS\r\n          comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          They had a fight.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          She must know the truth.\r\n\r\n                         ISAACS\r\n          Where do you think she's gone?\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Where would you go?\r\n          MARISSA turns to ISAACS.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm closing the CIA operation down.\r\n          Heller is dead, that's all that\r\n          matters to them. This we do alone.\r\n\r\n          185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185\r\n\r\n          HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the\r\n          train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,\r\n          many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing\r\n          resolution.\r\n          In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her\r\n          child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The\r\n          peace of the innocent.\r\n\r\n          186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186\r\n\r\n          The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called\r\n          Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland\r\n          and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits,\r\n          approaches a station guard.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          100.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I am looking for a train to\r\n          Galinka.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD\r\n          Galinka is a small village. No\r\n          trains. You must wait for bus in\r\n          the morning.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Where can I stay?\r\n          He points. HANNA sees the hotel.\r\n\r\n          187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187\r\n\r\n          HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the\r\n          filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.\r\n          Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.\r\n          She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at\r\n          ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him\r\n          as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death\r\n          of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's\r\n          face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.\r\n          Leaves the room.\r\n\r\n          188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188\r\n\r\n          HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the\r\n          shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty\r\n          room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-\r\n          drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she\r\n          goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands\r\n          there, drinking.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Do you have a sandwich?\r\n\r\n                         BARMAN\r\n          Kitchen is closed.\r\n          The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN\r\n          Get her something. Poor girl's\r\n          hungry.\r\n          The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.\r\n\r\n          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm from Leipzig.\r\n          HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.\r\n\r\n          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          You?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          The same.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN\r\n          Business?\r\n          He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.\r\n          It's grim. She leaves it, walks out.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Where are you going?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I am tired. I need to sleep.\r\n          She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.\r\n          BUSINESSMAN follows.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN\r\n          Hello?\r\n          She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN\r\n          follows.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I was just making nice\r\n          conversation. Yes?\r\n          As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Let's talk. Maybe we can do\r\n          business.\r\n          HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          You don't like talk, huh?\r\n          He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on\r\n          to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting\r\n          violently with his actions.\r\n\r\n                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Be nice. Be a nice little dolly.\r\n          HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over\r\n          her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN\r\n          grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.\r\n          But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,\r\n          like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs\r\n          a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal\r\n          rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his\r\n          eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,\r\n          repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her\r\n          primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n          When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next\r\n          to her. Not quite dead.\r\n          HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness\r\n          of her actions.\r\n          Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's\r\n          wallet, and leaves the room.\r\n\r\n          189 EXT. POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189\r\n\r\n          Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the\r\n          street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to\r\n          run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.\r\n          Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow\r\n          light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's\r\n          wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the\r\n          taxi.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I have this much. Can you take me\r\n          to Galinka?\r\n\r\n          190 EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190\r\n\r\n          HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest\r\n          road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is\r\n          arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall\r\n          snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,\r\n          just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if\r\n          from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the\r\n          paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the\r\n          businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes\r\n          it clean.\r\n          Suddenly the taxi stops.\r\n\r\n                         DRIVER\r\n          This is as far as the money gets\r\n          you.\r\n          HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          How much further?\r\n\r\n                         DRIVER\r\n          Twelve miles.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Please.\r\n          But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to\r\n          walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          103.\r\n          She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just\r\n          about dawn. Cold as hell.\r\n          She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past\r\n          fast. Blows icy air in her face.\r\n          She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.\r\n          It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.\r\n          Too shattered.\r\n          Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering\r\n          every ounce of energy.\r\n          Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,\r\n          ignoring her waves and cries.\r\n          HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.\r\n          Carries on walking.\r\n          Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she\r\n          make it?\r\n          Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost\r\n          magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm going to Galinka. Can you help\r\n          me?\r\n          A woman's voice, German, in German.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          Yes I can take you there.\r\n          And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling\r\n          face of MARISSA WIEGLER.\r\n\r\n          191 INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA - NIGHT 191\r\n\r\n          MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.\r\n          HANNA has no idea who she is.\r\n          MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          It's a very dull place Galinka. Why\r\n          would you want to go there?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I was born there. But I've never\r\n          really seen it. Why are you going?\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I have some business to sort out.\r\n          She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          It's very lucky we ran into each\r\n          other, don't you think?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Yes...\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          You've hurt your arm.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          It's okay.\r\n          MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I'm Astrid.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You're not German. Are you\r\n          American?\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          That's right. I lived there for\r\n          many years. I travel a lot.\r\n          MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first\r\n          time in ages. She feels the tears come.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh dear, what's wrong with you?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Sorry.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          It's okay. Are you in trouble?\r\n          HANNA nods. She fights the tears.\r\n          MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          What sort of trouble?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          (though her tears)\r\n          I don't know what to do. Nothing is\r\n          what I thought it would be. It's...\r\n          ugly and cruel and I don't know\r\n          where to go, or... I'm stupid. I\r\n          don't know what I expected...\r\n          MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the\r\n          emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Sometimes I feel the same way.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n          HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.\r\n          MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I like music.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Sleep why don't you? You look very\r\n          tired. It will take half an hour on\r\n          this road.\r\n          HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has\r\n          slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the\r\n          window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.\r\n\r\n          192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192\r\n\r\n          Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.\r\n\r\n          193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193\r\n\r\n          MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her\r\n          gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she\r\n          sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks\r\n          her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers\r\n          off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She\r\n          puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same\r\n          GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.\r\n          HANNA is jolted awake.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Where are we?\r\n          MARISSA calms herself instantly.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Nearly there.\r\n          HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.\r\n\r\n          194 EXT. GALINKA 194\r\n\r\n          MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (V.O.)\r\n          This is it.\r\n\r\n          195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195\r\n\r\n          HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is\r\n          confused.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          106.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          It's so small.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Yes. Just a few cottages. And the\r\n          old bunker.\r\n          HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Thank you for the ride. You're very\r\n          kind.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I wish there was more I could do\r\n          for you.\r\n          MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the\r\n          intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and\r\n          retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          Here, take this.\r\n          HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          I hope you find what you're looking\r\n          for.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Thank you.\r\n          She gets out and shuts the door behind her.\r\n\r\n          196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196\r\n\r\n          HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the\r\n          ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then\r\n          drives off.\r\n          HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not\r\n          used for many years.\r\n          She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance\r\n          there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the\r\n          old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a\r\n          long time.\r\n          She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then\r\n          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the\r\n          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,\r\n          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up\r\n          the narrow tree-lined driveway.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n\r\n          197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197\r\n\r\n          HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.\r\n          She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it\r\n          on and walks into the darkness.\r\n\r\n          198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198\r\n\r\n          With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily\r\n          deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of\r\n          daylight recedes slowly to nothing.\r\n          The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.\r\n          HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines\r\n          her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.\r\n          She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the\r\n          tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.\r\n          HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red\r\n          shoe, its buckle rusted.\r\n          She walks on into the dark.\r\n          HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,\r\n          but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of\r\n          a gap to squeeze through.\r\n\r\n          199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199\r\n\r\n          At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but\r\n          dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls\r\n          are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of\r\n          children holding hands.\r\n          She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears\r\n          the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the\r\n          direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,\r\n          dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She\r\n          shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a\r\n          third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled\r\n          with laughing children.\r\n          Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.\r\n          HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows\r\n          she has been here before.\r\n          She walks on through the tunnels.\r\n\r\n          200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200\r\n\r\n          HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's\r\n          dormitory.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          108.\r\n          At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.\r\n          From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the\r\n          sound of children singing.\r\n\r\n                         CHILDREN\r\n          Happy Birthday to you,\r\n          Happy Birthday to you...\r\n          From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of\r\n          CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake\r\n          lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily\r\n          in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking\r\n          straight towards her as they sing.\r\n\r\n          CHILDREN (CONT'D)\r\n          Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...\r\n          The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.\r\n\r\n          CHILDREN (CONT'D)\r\n          ... Hanna.\r\n          Happy Birthday to you!\r\n          HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The\r\n          children disappear with the flames of the candles.\r\n          The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the\r\n          tunnel.\r\n          HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the\r\n          footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES\r\n          walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA WIEGLER.\r\n          HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from\r\n          the car.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You're Marissa Wiegler.\r\n          HANNA starts to shake.\r\n          MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is\r\n          the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.\r\n          HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Don't worry sweetie. I don't want\r\n          to hurt you.\r\n          MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of\r\n          maternal care.\r\n          HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          109.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          I could have killed you already\r\n          when you were asleep in the car.\r\n          HANNA'S still shaking.\r\n          HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all\r\n          with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack\r\n          or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          Did Erik tell you about this place?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          Where are the other children?\r\n          She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Sleeping. They're all sleeping.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          I don't believe you.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure\r\n          you walk out of here and keep\r\n          walking. Grow up and grow old in\r\n          safety and security. No one need\r\n          know a thing. But you have to trust\r\n          me. You can't talk about this with\r\n          anyone. It's what we call\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cclassified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you tell anyone,\r\n          it'll be dangerous for both of us.\r\n          HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying\r\n          hard not to succumb.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          You killed my mother.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          You're mother didn't want you,\r\n          sweetie. I saved you.\r\n          HANNA just stares, not believing her.\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm the only person left who\r\n          understands who you are. The only\r\n          one who cares.\r\n          MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a\r\n          motherly gesture...\r\n\r\n          MARISSA (CONT'D)\r\n          I practically am your mother.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          110.\r\n          HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch\r\n          and runs into the shadows.\r\n          ISAACS raises his gun fires.\r\n\r\n          201 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 201\r\n\r\n          HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the\r\n          HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,\r\n          as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have\r\n          night vision on their rifles.\r\n          HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them\r\n          coming.\r\n          A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point\r\n          of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel\r\n          stretching on.\r\n          Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly\r\n          white.\r\n          She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.\r\n          Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The\r\n          flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.\r\n          Silence once more.\r\n          HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.\r\n          From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the\r\n          sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the\r\n          tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one\r\n          movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.\r\n          Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes\r\n          staring back at her.\r\n          She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers\r\n          into the darkness.\r\n\r\n          202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202\r\n\r\n          HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision\r\n          sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.\r\n          She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab\r\n          bench.\r\n          A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small\r\n          torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps\r\n          through the broken glass that litters the floor.\r\n          HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into\r\n          the torch light.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          111.\r\n          She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S\r\n          left arm.\r\n          He drops his torch which slides across the floor.\r\n          HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should\r\n          be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she\r\n          follows to a metal cabinet.\r\n          She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its\r\n          flimsy doors.\r\n          The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.\r\n          HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the\r\n          torch.\r\n          She switches the torch off.\r\n\r\n          203 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA. 203\r\n\r\n          ISAACS, unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the\r\n          tunnel. He feels something at his legs. Points his torch to\r\n          find the deer pulling at his trouser leg. He shoots it. Then\r\n          runs further down into the tunnel.\r\n          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue\r\n          her prey.\r\n\r\n          204 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA. 204\r\n\r\n          ISAACS is back in the dormitory. With torch in hand he\r\n          searches under the beds. Behind him he hears HANNA enter. He\r\n          switches off his torch and crawls under a bed.\r\n          HANNA walks slowly between the beds. Under the bed ISAACS is\r\n          preparing to fire, now watching her feet.\r\n          Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air\r\n          and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is\r\n          clutching the end of the bed. He fires, hits nothing and she\r\n          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.\r\n          His torch rolls away. His arms are trapped under the bed,\r\n          he's unable to move.\r\n          With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off\r\n          himself.\r\n          They fight.\r\n          HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his\r\n          temple. She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head\r\n          repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM.\r\n          Silence - he's dead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          112.\r\n          HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -\r\n          looks down at what she's done. Shocked by her own violence\r\n          she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment.\r\n          She gets up and runs from the dormitory.\r\n\r\n          205 INT/EXT. TUNNELS/TUNNEL MOUTH. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 205\r\n\r\n          HANNA runs back through the tunnels.\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          No more. No more.\r\n          Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the\r\n          tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette\r\n          is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see\r\n          the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S\r\n          trigger.\r\n          MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes\r\n          forward again, walking calmly towards her.\r\n          She stops and drops her gun to the ground.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Everything I see is nothing I want.\r\n          MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.\r\n          She smiles.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Let me take care of you?\r\n\r\n                         HANNA\r\n          No. I don't want that.\r\n          HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the\r\n          opposite direction.\r\n          MARISSA watches her walk away.\r\n          HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.\r\n\r\n                         MARISSA\r\n          Hanna.\r\n          HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA.\r\n\r\n          CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n          206 EXT.

She's back wearing her furs\r\n          again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small\r\n          wooden bowl.\r\n          In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved\r\n          Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (V.O.)\r\n          The Earth is the third planet from\r\n          the Sun, and the fifth-largest of\r\n          the eight planets in the Solar\r\n          System.\r\n          HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours\r\n          some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Home to millions of species,\r\n          including humans, Earth is the only\r\n          place in the universe where life is\r\n          known to exist.\r\n          She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her\r\n          friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has\r\n          a small family of cubs.\r\n          HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to\r\n          drink.\r\n\r\n          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          The planet formed over four and a\r\n          half billion years ago, and life\r\n          appeared on its surface within a\r\n          billion years.\r\n          HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face.
