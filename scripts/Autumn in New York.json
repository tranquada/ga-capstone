CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               A COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. \n               All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. \n               Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.\n\n               To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers \n               and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and \n               soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.\n\n<b>               CLOSER ON THE COUPLE\n</b>\n               He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly \n               handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first \n               glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war \n               against time has been the undisputed victor.\n\n               Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders \n               strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are \n               touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging \n               disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself.\n\n               Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. \n               Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her \n               and, if the past prevails, so many will come after.\n\n               She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         -- and I could have waited to tell \n                         you, but I wanted to leave no room \n                         for misunderstanding.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         Well, you certainly didn't.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Of course I do. It's human. But \n                         what I don't get is why you'd want \n                         to announce it so quickly. I mean, \n                         we just met.

It's \n                         the saddest thing about getting older. \n                         You know people so quickly. I even \n                         knew you'd end up hating me.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         Well, you're wrong. I don't.\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                              (with a weary smile)\n                         Give it time.\n\n               She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. \n               She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns \n               and looks, squinting into the sun.\n\n               He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO \n               DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- \n               most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual-\n               bohemian look to them.\n\n               Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, \n               willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an \n               eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, \n               her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         -- and for weeks I sat by her bed \n                         and cried. I told her I loved her \n                         and I begged her not to leave me. \n                         All I could think about was what I'd \n                         lose if she died. And then one \n                         night... she was in really bad pain... \n                         I stopped thinking about myself for \n                         a second and I thought about her.\n                              (fighting tears)\n                         I stopped crying. I said goodbye. \n                         And in less than an hour Ella was \n                         gone.\n\n               The woman whispers in Wills' ear --\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         It's so sad.\n\n               But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen \n               interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I really think it's possible to hold \n                         a person back... cry them back... \n                         from dying. That's what I did to \n                         Ella and I'll never do it to anyone \n                         else again.\n                              (softly)\n                         I hope no one ever does it to me.\n\n               She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear \n               runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away.\n\n               The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         So what do you know about her?\n\n               He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But \n               his answer is nonchalant --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         That she's just a kid.\n\n               He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. \n               He steals one last look back.\n\n               Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. \n               Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them.\n\n               Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --\n\n<b>                                     OLD MAN\n</b>                         I met Ella at City College in 1938...\n\n               Wills slowly turns and walks away.\n\n<b>               MUSIC AND TITLES IN:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

CUSTOMERS and STAFF \n               greet him warmly.\n\n               As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- \n               sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city \n               life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and \n               kiss their cheeks.\n\n               Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path --\n\n<b>                                     CELIA\n</b>                         Look, I have no right to say this, \n                         okay?

Tell him you've \n                         just been promoted.\n\n               Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. She \n               can't believe it.\n\n               A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles \n               and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- \n               passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM.\n\n               From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Wills, his \n               curiosity piqued, follows.\n\n<b>               INT. REAR DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n               The waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. \n               There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends. Wills cannot \n               see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view.\n\n               Just as Wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps \n               away. Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. At first \n               he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens \n               and brightens.\n\n               It's Charlotte. She wears a black velvet dress and a \n               wonderfully eccentric hat. Her eyes glow in the candlelight. \n               Through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she \n               cries out --\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         You guys!

Okay.\n\n               Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than \n               you might expect, extinguishes the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS \n               and CHEERS.\n\n               To Charlotte's right sits SIMON LORING, late 20's, English, \n               sardonic, adoring. He gestures at her CHEST and says --\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                         Watch carefully, everyone -- they \n                         ought to begin emerging any moment \n                         now.\n\n               Everyone laughs.

He considers approaching Charlotte, but then \n               he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their table, \n               idly stabbing at her drink with a straw.\n\n               Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but \n               then hears --\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Is that Wills Keane?\n\n               He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly \n               frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. She holds a mixed \n               drink --\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         It sure as hell is and he hasn't \n                         changed a bit!\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         I'm sorry, do I --\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot. \n                         Dolly!\n\n               His smile shows uneasy surprise --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         My God, it is.\n\n<b>                                     DOLLY\n</b>                         Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass \n                         but good.

She looks over. Her view is such that she sees \n               Wills but not Dolores.\n\n               A faint blush creeps into Charlotte's cheeks. She pretends \n               to listen as Shannon tells a story --\n\n<b>                                     SHANNON\n</b>                         -- and you know how bouncer's get. \n                         He's like, \"That's the worst fake \n                         I.D.

City lights glimmer in the \n               distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I couldn't get a cab, so I took the \n                         subway... only it was an express and \n                         it didn't stop at --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         You realize, don't you, that you're \n                         a full eighteen minutes late?\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I know...

And then he \n               offers her an amused, reassuring smile --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         Charlotte, relax.

In fact, you disappoint me: \n                         I was looking forward to at least \n                         another half hour of suspense.\n\n               Flattered, her face brightens --\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I could leave and come back.\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         Nope, too late.

It's sublimely \n               simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face \n               betrays nothing --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         Try it on.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I can't.

She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and \n               sets it at the correct angle.\n\n               Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels \n               his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones --\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         It's perfect.

People \n                         start falling into types. Pretty \n                         soon you know a person before you've \n                         even been introduced. And if it's a \n                         woman, before the romance even starts, \n                         a whisper in your head tells you \n                         exactly what it is and how long it's \n                         going to last. And the saddest, the \n                         most tedious, part of all is that \n                         that little voice is almost always \n                         right.\n                              (popping the cork)\n                         Now, what I like about you -- and I \n                         think that's actually what inspired \n                         this little lecture -- is that I \n                         find you completely unprecedented... \n                         and, therefore, wholly unpredictable.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         God, it must be a relief.\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                              (confused)\n                         What?\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         To finally deliver that speech to a \n                         woman and actually have it apply to \n                         her.\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         Now wait a minute.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         No, because coincidentally I am all \n                         those things you just said.

That isn't strictly accurate. \n                         Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue \n                         malignancy, but it isn't cancer -- \n                         although it sometimes can be just as \n                         aggressive.\n                              (sitting)\n                         It's most common in children. In \n                         young adults, the condition is \n                         extremely rare. In Charlotte's case, \n                         the tumor is located in her chest. \n                         It's growing rapidly and has proved \n                         resistant to both irradiation and \n                         chemotherapy. And because of its \n                         proximity to her aorta, surgery is \n                         out of the question.\n\n<b>                                     WILLS\n</b>                         So then what treatment is she getting?\n\n<b>                                     SIBLEY\n</b>                         At present?

In the end, surgery could become \n                         an option, but her chances of survival \n                         would be slim. Right now Charlotte's \n                         against it. She's signed a directive \n                         forbidding any sort of heroic \n                         intervention.\n\n               A silence settles between them.
