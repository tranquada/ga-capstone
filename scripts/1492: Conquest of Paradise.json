AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY\n\n\tWe start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a\n\tsplendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the\n\tgarter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate\n\thands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large\n\ttopaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing\n\ton marble floors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tA Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,\n\tdark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is\n\tTREASURER SANCHEZ.\n\n\tA door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We\n\tcan now here a subdued conversation.\n\n\tTREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:\n\n\tThe door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.\n\tA WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN\n\tISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.\n\n\tHe bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large\n\ttable.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and\n\tthree dignitaries of Church and State.\n\n\tAll sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document\n\tand starts to read aloud.\n\n\tOn screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tYour Majesty would wish to know the\n\t\t\ttrue facts concerning the island of\n\t\t\tHispanola, our first settlement in\n\t\t\tthe New World, and the activities\n\t\t\tthere of your servant, Christopher\n\t\t\tColumbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,\n\t\t\tGovernor of that Island.  You will\n\t\t\tremember with what hopes and\n\t\t\tpromises he beguiled us -- the truth\n\t\t\tis that he now presides over a state\n\t\t\tof chaos, degradation and madness\n\t\t\tbeyond imagining.\n\n\tSANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tFrom the beginning, Columbus proved\n\t\t\thimself incapable of managing the\n\t\t\taffairs of the island.  He appointed\n\t\t\this brothers to important positions,\n\t\t\tat once injuring the pride and\n\t\t\tdignity of the nobles who had gone\n\t\t\twith him.  He promised to build a\n\t\t\tcity, the City of Isabel, named\n\t\t\tafter Your Majesty.  What he\n\t\t\tactually built was nothing but a\n\t\t\tcollection of huts, and that in the\n\t\t\twrong place, for all of it was\n\t\t\teasily swept away by rain and mud.\n\t\t\tIs that not so, Brother Buyl?\n\n\tThe PRIEST nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\t\t\tYes, Your Honor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tHe promised gold.  Not finding the\n\t\t\teasy quantities he promised,\n\t\t\tColumbus commanded each Indian to\n\t\t\tpay an annual tribute.  Most being\n\t\t\tunable to, they were barbarously\n\t\t\tpunished, against the express wish\n\t\t\tof Your Christian Majesties...\n\n\tISABEL lowers her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tSince provocation and injustice\n\t\t\tnever ceases, many of the Indians\n\t\t\thave fled to the forests, or have\n\t\t\tbegun to slay the Christians.\n\n\tISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tISABEL\n\t\t\tCould it be so?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\t\t\tYes, Your Majesty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tBut there is worse.  From the\n\t\t\tbeginning, he forced the nobles to\n\t\t\tundergo physical labor, treating\n\t\t\tthem equally with the Indians, all\n\t\t\tof them reduced to slavery.  When\n\t\t\tthe nobleman Adrian de Moxica\n\t\t\tprotested against such treatment...\n\t\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\t\t... he was executed.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tIs that not true also, Brother\n\t\t\tBuyl?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\t\t\tYes, Your Honor.  It is all true.\n\t\t\tAll of it.  I saw it with my own\n\t\t\teyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tHe has lost control.  His great\n\t\t\tarrogance has led him into\n\t\t\tdepravity.  He encourages our\n\t\t\tsoldiers to marry the native women.\n\t\t\tHe promised a paradise, but he has\n\t\t\tmade a hell full of all its horrors.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tISABEL\n\t\t\tIs that the man I knew, Treasurer\n\t\t\tSanchez?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANCHEZ\n\t\t\tYes, Your Majesty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY\n\n\tCLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,\n\tsweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects\n\tcrawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.\n\tThere is a dripping sound of water.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO (V.O.)\n\t\t\tOf all the words my Father wrote and\n\t\t\tthere were many, I remember these\n\t\t\tthe most.  \"Nothing that results\n\t\t\tfrom human progress is achieved with\n\t\t\tunanimous consent...\"\n\n\tRain is falling into the room over documents spread on a\n\ttable.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some\n\tof the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.

He stares out by the window, and we\n\tsee:\n\n\tA devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed\n\thuts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO (V.O.)\n\t\t\tThere was a time when the New World\n\t\t\tdidn't exist...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n\n\tA vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,\n\tinfinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,\n\tmeeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl\n\tand misty light.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO (V.O.)\n\t\t\t... The sun set in the west on an\n\t\t\tocean where no man had dared to\n\t\t\tventure.  And beyond that,\n\t\t\tinfinity...\n\n\tPulling back, we discover:\n\n\tA TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle\n\tthirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten\n\tface frames unusually bright eyes.\n\n\tOn the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491\n\n\tCOLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at\n\tthe top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO\n\tlooks up at him in adoration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO (V.O.)\n\t\t\tOnce I asked my Father where he\n\t\t\twanted to go.  And he replied:  \"I\n\t\t\twant to travel all over the seas.  I\n\t\t\twant to get behind the weather...\"\n\n\tFERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his\n\tFATHER.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tA rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone\n\twalls and thousands of sheep.\n\n\tFERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing\n\tthe sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-\n\tspirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching\n\this SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the\n\tsolitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS calls out to his son:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tFernando!\n\n\tFERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.\n\n\tAs they move along the track we now see, perched on a\n\tdistant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La\n\tRabida, their destination.\n\n\n\tEXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tAs they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,\n\tFERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under\n\tthe ROMAN arches.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tDiego!\n\n\tHe rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an\n\tadolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,\n\tdelicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tDiego!  Aren't you going to kiss\n\t\t\tyour brother?\n\n\tDIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is\n\timmediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,\n\thurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.\n\n\tThe MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-\n\thaired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.\n\tMARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his\n\tarms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns\n\tto DIEGO.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tDiego, take Fernando to the dining\n\t\t\thall.  He must be hungry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\t\t\tYes, Father.\n\n\tBoth CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and\n\tMARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tDiego is a bright boy -- a pleasure\n\t\t\tto teach -- but so serious...\n\t\t\tBrothers should be raised together,\n\t\t\tColon.  Even brothers from different\n\t\t\tmothers...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tFather, I am doing what I think is\n\t\t\tthe best for him.  And he has the\n\t\t\tteacher I would have chosen for\n\t\t\tmyself.\n\n\tMARCHENA laughs at the compliment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tJust be careful you don't lose him.\n\n\tThey have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a\n\tdoor.\n\n\n\tINT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tHundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the\n\tmiracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several\n\tMONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily\n\t\"ILLUMINATING\" some of these massive volumes, delicately\n\tpainting around the letters in bright colors and gold\n\tleaf.\n\n\tRays of light fall diagonally through high openings,\n\tprojecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As\n\tMARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is\n\tpunctuated by light and shadow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\t\t(fumbles in a pocket\n\t\t\t\tunder his robe)\n\t\t\tI have something for you.\n\n\tAlmost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tYou will be heard at the University\n\t\t\tof Salamanca...\n\n\tCOLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he\n\ttears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tGod... That's in a week!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tThat's what it says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tHow did you manage it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\t\tWith some difficulty.  I had to\n\t\t\tpromise them you were not a total\n\t\t\tfool.\n\n\tMARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden\n\tpanel.\n\n\n\tINT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY\n\n\tMARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the\n\tfloor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,\n\tinstruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an\n\tinquiring mind.\n\n\tWith practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a\n\thundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits\n\tbehind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA\n\tlights a candle and considers the mess.  Then\n\tmethodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him\n\twith his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.\n\n\tWhen he looks up again, there is a new severity in his\n\texpression.  He turns over an hourglass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tWhy do you wish to sail west?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tTo open a new route to Asia.  At the\n\t\t\tmoment there are only two ways of\n\t\t\treaching it...\n\n\tHe leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the\n\tdesk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tBy sea, sailing around the African\n\t\t\tContinent -- the journey takes a\n\t\t\tyear...\n\n\tHis finger traces the journey, from west to east.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tOr by land...\n\n\tWe are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger\n\ttracing a line between Europe and the Far East.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS (O.S.)\n\t\t\t... But the Turks have closed this\n\t\t\troute to all Christians.  Trading\n\t\t\twith the Orient has become arduous,\n\t\t\tif not dangerous.\n\t\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\t\tThere is a third way...\n\n\tWe notice that the outline of the European continent is\n\tfamiliar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse\n\tof ocean, the whole American continent is missing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tBy sailing West across the Ocean\n\t\t\tSea.\n\n\tCLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tHow can you be so certain?  The\n\t\t\tOcean is said to be infinite.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tIgnorance!  I believe the Indies are\n\t\t\tno more than 750 leagues west of the\n\t\t\tCanary Islands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tHow can you be so certain?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tThe calculations of Toscanelli Marin\n\t\t\tde Tyr, Esdras...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\t\tEsdras is a Jew.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tSo was Christ!\n\n\tMARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.

Don't let passion\n\t\t\toverwhelm you, Colon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(mockingly)\n\t\t\tI'll try to remember that,\n\t\t\tMarchena...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\tFather Marchena!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(ignoring this)\n\t\t\tPassion is something one cannot\n\t\t\tcontrol!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARCHENA\n\t\t\t\t(heatedly)\n\t\t\tYou get so carried away when you are\n\t\t\tbeing contradicted!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI've been contradicted all my\n\t\t\tlife...

COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING\n\n\tDIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS\n\tappears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to\n\tgo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tDiego.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes\n\tmeet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tWould you like to come and stay with\n\t\t\tus?\n\n\tUncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an\n\tanswer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI'll do whatever makes you happy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\t\t\tI am happy, Father.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.\n\n\tHe climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his\n\tBROTHER as they ride off.\n\n\n\tEXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,\n\tthrough narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the\n\tair.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with\n\texcitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then\n\tmore people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,\n\trowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.\n\n\tHuge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside\n\tthe cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS\n\ttries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens\n\tin the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the\n\tcenter of the square stand three pyres, already alit.\n\tHOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tLook, Father!\n\n\tBefore COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the\n\tmule and into the crowd.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tFernando!\n\n\tBut the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.\n\tCOLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night\n\tsky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with\n\ta lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.\n\n\tFERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.\n\n\tA PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a\n\tMAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the \"sambenito\", a\n\trobe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been\n\tcrudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,\n\tindicating that the man is Jewish.\n\n\tTHE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss\n\tthe crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.\n\n\tFERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't\n\trealize what is happening.  He is too close to the\n\tplatform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tFernando!\n\n\tHe motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him\n\taway from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The\n\tdistance now allows him to see inside the flames.\n\n\tA HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a\n\tsilent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the\n\thead falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses\n\tinto the fire.\n\n\n\tINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,\n\tstone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is\n\tmute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes\n\tthe mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,\n\tBEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a\n\tbeautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic\n\tpersonality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO\n\tglances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say\n\tanything.\n\n\n\tINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is\n\tcooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tExecutions.  In the square.\n\n\tBEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water\n\ton his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tThey've agreed to see me in a week.\n\n\tBEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up\n\twith a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI could be gone for years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\t\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI haven't given you much of a life.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\t\t\t\t(amused)\n\t\t\tWell... that's true.

But you're never here!\n\n\tThey laugh and kiss.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tPerhaps I was never meant to live\n\t\t\twith a woman...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\t\t\t\t(still kissing him)\n\t\t\tI find that hard to believe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n\tThey are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is\n\tunusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little\n\twine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO\n\tlooks up at him, surprised.

Students-novices are playing\n\t\"pelote\", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run\n\twith their robes tucked around their waist, revealing\n\twhite legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to\n\ttheir class.\n\n\tWe find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above\n\tthe court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes\n\tfrom a door, and looks around the group.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONK\n\t\t\t\t(hesitant)\n\t\t\tChristopher Columbus?\n\n\n\tINT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY\n\n\tAn El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on\n\tdark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on\n\ttheir faces.

UTAPAN glances\n\tat the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the\n\tbite on ALONSO'S ankle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tHelp him!\n\n\tALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around\n\tat his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is\n\tnothing he can do.\n\n\tALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his\n\tfriends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His\n\tlook is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n\t\t\tDo something!  Help him!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tHe dead.\n\n\tALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate\n\tin their helplessness.  Others simply move away,\n\thorrified.  One of them cries.\n\n\n\tEXT.  RIVER - DAY\n\n\tStanding in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a\n\tgold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at\n\tCOLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into\n\tthe water without a word.\n\n\tThe group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the\n\thumidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak\n\tbandanas, and tie them around their necks...\n\n\tOne after another, they stand up slowly -- they look\n\tdiscouraged, tired, and beaten.\n\n\n\tEXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY\n\n\tUTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully\n\tarmed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and\n\tthe vicious insect bites.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly\n\ttrots forward.\n\n\tFinally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He\n\tcalls out to UTAPAN.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tUtapan!  Wait!\n\n\tUTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with\n\tcomical energy.\n\n\tOn their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning\n\tagainst a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair\n\tsticking to his forehead.\n\n\tAs COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another\n\tSAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around\n\tPINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPINZON\n\t\t\tWell... You'll have to continue\n\t\t\twithout me...\n\n\tCOLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men\n\tand jungle, as far as one can see.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tNo.  It's enough.  What would you\n\t\t\tsay to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?\n\n\tPINZON grins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPINZON\n\t\t\tAnd a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!\n\t\t\tI'd sell my soul for it.\n\t\t\t\t(to his officer)\n\t\t\tHelp me up.  I've got to piss, gold.\n\n\tThey all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.\n\n\tPINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to\n\turinate.  It is red.  Suddenly dizzy, he reels and\n\tcollapses.\n\n\n\tEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\n\n\tA line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a\n\tmountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift\n\tstretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with\n\tsweat.\n\n\tThey enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.\n\tUTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.\n\n\n\tINT.  HUT - NIGHT\n\n\tA INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S\n\tmouth.  COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.  But\n\tUTAPAN stops him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tHe cures.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.\n\n\n\tINT.  CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT\n\n\tIn the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,\n\tMENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a\n\tSpanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost\n\tcovering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with\n\tsolemn wonder.\n\n\tIn return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of\n\tleaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing\n\tmask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable\n\tto conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of\n\tthe metal.\n\n\tHe waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks\n\tat him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by\n\tthe SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\t\t(to Columbus)\n\t\t\tYou come!  You speak first!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tTell the Chief we thank him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tChief knows.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tTell him his country is very\n\t\t\tbeautiful.  Tell him we are leaving\n\t\t\tmen here -- to build a fort.\n\n\tUTAPAN translates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tTell him we will return very soon.\n\t\t\tMany of us.\n\n\tUTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple\n\tquestion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tChief says -- how many?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tThousands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tWhy?\n\n\tCOLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the\n\tfirst time he seems to be caught short.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tTo bring the word of God.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tChief says -- he has a God.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(pursuing)\n\t\t\t... and also to bring medicine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tChief says...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\t\tHe has medicine.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tTell him we admire his people.\n\n\tUTAPAN translates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tChief says he knows you like his...\n\t\t\t\t(searches for the\n\t\t\t\tword)\n\t\t\tWomen...\n\n\tAnd the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and\n\twalks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving\n\tCOLUMBUS alone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(with a little\n\t\t\t\tsmile)\n\t\t\tThat's a beginning...\n\n\n\tEXT.  SHORE - DAY\n\n\tWatched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty\n\tof the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull\n\tout towards the two remaining ships.\n\n\tPINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS,\n\tUTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS (V.O.)\n\t\t\tMarch 1493... Thirty nine of my men\n\t\t\tvolunteered to stay behind.  God\n\t\t\twilling we will be back in less than\n\t\t\ta year...\n\n\tThe boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore\n\tgrowing smaller.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT\n\n\tCLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings\n\tviolently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if\n\tthe mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty\n\tin his log-book.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS (V.O.)\n\t\t\t... Several men are ill.  We did not\n\t\t\tfind signs of civilization.  No\n\t\t\tcities, no temples... Nothing that\n\t\t\tresembles Marco Polo's descriptions.\n\t\t\tMy ships are not filled with the\n\t\t\tspices and the gold that Spain was\n\t\t\thoping for.  But this land\n\t\t\tintoxicates the senses like the\n\t\t\tstrongest of perfumes... And all I\n\t\t\tcan think of, is to return to these\n\t\t\tuntamed lands...\n\n\tSuddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from\n\tthe table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.\n\n\n\tEXT.  SEA - NIGHT\n\n\tWe are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying\n\tproportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates\n\tthe darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the\n\tmassive seas.\n\n\n\tEXT.  DECK - NIGHT\n\n\tFive MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck\n\tjumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then\n\tfalls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.\n\tWaves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for\n\tmercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard\n\tabove the storm.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a\n\tlifeline.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(screaming to the\n\t\t\t\tsailors)\n\t\t\tGet below!

COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards\n\tthe mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons\n\tof water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The\n\twood groans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tWe may have to cut it!\n\n\tMENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises\n\tinto the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing\n\tbeneath them for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(screaming out)\n\t\t\tI'll stay here -- to decide if we\n\t\t\tcut it.  Help me!\n\n\tWith MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one\n\trope under his arms, the other around his waist.  MENDEZ\n\thands him a horn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\t\tNow go!\n\n\tMENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI said -- below deck, Mendez!\n\n\tMENDEZ crawls away.\n\n\tAnother huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,\n\talmost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light\n\tmaking it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the\n\tlightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tOne... two... three... four...\n\n\tThere's an enormous thunderclap on \"four\" -- it indicates\n\thow close they are to the eye of the storm.\n\n\tThe ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming\n\tnever to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,\n\tscreams out:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tDamn you!\n\n\tAs if in answer, another flash of lightning that\n\tilluminates the sky and the sea.

He turns to his family,\n\tkeeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his\n\tvision.\n\n\tThe procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in\n\ttribal regalia...\n\n\tAs they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon\n\tCOLUMBUS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

COLUMBUS.\n\tQUEEN ISABEL.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him\n\twith rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to\n\ttheir astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tYou must not inhale, but simply\n\t\t\tallow the palate to enjoy the flavor\n\t\t\tof the Tobacco...\n\n\tHe hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,\n\tMOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.\n\tHe gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of\n\tthe others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMOXICA\n\t\t\t\t(deeply embarrassed)\n\t\t\tAnd you say this is an Indian vice?\n\t\t\tBy God!

The SERVANT goes to open\n\tthe door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,\n\tcarrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan\n\tthemselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket\n\tdown in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tThese are gifts for Your Majesty.\n\n\tISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold\n\tinside.  She takes out some of the little golden\n\tornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.\n\n\tShe holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.\n\n\tISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at\n\tCOLUMBUS.\n\n\tThe image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the\n\tARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tISABEL\n\t\t\tWe are more than gratified.\n\n\tThe guests laugh obsequiously.

THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,\n\twho stands his ground, brandishing his lance.\n\n\tUTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the\n\tcentaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the\n\tanimal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back\n\tcomically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.\n\n\tWithout warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More\n\tINDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now\n\tmore have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them\n\tapproach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,\n\tretreating then touching until they fill the compound.\n\n\tAt this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all\n\taround them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.\n\tA moment of tension.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we\n\tmeet before.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tAsk the Chief what happened to my\n\t\t\tmen?\n\n\tThe CHIEF answers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUTAPAN\n\t\t\tAnother tribe made war on them...\n\t\t\tcame by sea... took them away...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBROTHER BUYL\n\t\t\tGod have mercy on their souls...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMOXICA\n\t\t\tThe monkey is lying.\n\n\tA pause.

The INDIANS raise their\n\theads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed\n\tat them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.\n\n\tThis sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.

Without a cry he\n\tfalls forward into the water, and is carried away by the\n\tcurrent.\n\n\tTwo more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in\n\tthe water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river\n\tstained with blood.\n\n\tStill no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless\n\tstart to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...\n\tothers continue to wade across the river.

The MAN next to\n\thim is killed, and carried away by the current.\n\n\tNow, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.\n\tThere is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other\n\tweapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own\n\tare outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are\n\tbeginning to surrender.\n\n\tIn the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls\n\thimself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.\n\tCOLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks\n\tforward into the jungle.

It's clear he's\n\tfeeling seasick, trying to control it.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out\n\tat the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.

We see the outline of the continent of Asia.\n\tAn OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at\n\tthe map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a\n\tpiece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the\n\tmap.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the\n\tPanamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO\n\tgather round.

He looks even older now, with his mass\n\tof pure white hair.\n\n\tBEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a\n\tdecanter of water.  She places it on a small table near\n\tCOLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.\n\n\tAs she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her\n\tback.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tCan't you stay with us a little?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\t\t\tI am busy inside.\n\n\tHe smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEATRIX\n\t\t\tWhat is it, now?  Tell me...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI can't keep my eyes off you.  I\n\t\t\twould like to catch up with all the\n\t\t\tmoments I didn't spend with you.\n\n\tFERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and\n\tslightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake\n\tair of reproach.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tWhat are you listening to?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tI am not listening, Father.  But I\n\t\t\tcan't help hearing.\n\n\tFERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tIt's Diego... He is at the Court,\n\t\t\twith Santangel... He says they hope\n\t\t\tto get your privileges restored...\n\t\t\tAnd maybe the house.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very\n\tlittle importance to him now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tBut how is he?  And Dona Maria?\n\n\tFERNANDO continues to read.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tFine, it seems.  Diego is thinking\n\t\t\tof starting a pearl trade, in Santo\n\t\t\tDomingo... He says he received many\n\t\t\tletters for you.  Some of your men,\n\t\t\tmostly.\n\n\tHe opens one of them, glances at it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tThis one is from Mendez!\n\n\tCOLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tWhat does he say?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tHe asks when he can come to visit\n\t\t\tyou.  He left his address.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\t\tHe never had one... except aboard my\n\t\t\tships!\n\n\tFERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tI want you to tell me everything you\n\t\t\tremember, Father.  From the\n\t\t\tbeginning.  Everything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tReally?\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tGod... I wouldn't know where to\n\t\t\tstart... and yet...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFERNANDO\n\t\t\tTell me the first thing that comes\n\t\t\tto your mind.\n\n\tCOLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are\n\tfixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLUMBUS\n\t\t\tI remember...\n\n\tWe see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ...
