THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS\n</b><b>     SOFT COPY.\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>     EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY\n</b>\n<b>     BEGIN TITLES OVER:\n</b>\n     It is early morning and already hot.  INSECTS drone, crackle,\n     and scurry for shade.  PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun.\n     We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth.\n\n     On a dusty highway, a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote.\n     One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of\n     the carcass.\n\n     In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a\n     small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang\n     convertible, its top down.  Its candy-apple red burns like a\n     brilliant fireball under the sun.  As the car drifts closer, we\n     see steam escaping from under the hood.  Sammi Smith's \"Please\n     Help Me Get Through The Night\" plays on the car's radio.\n\n<b>     INT. BOBBY COOPER'S MUSTANG - DAY\n</b>\n     At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young,\n     good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find\n     country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it\n     shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the\n     steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing\n     Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand\n     as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in\n     the road and lays on the horn.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Get off the goddamn road!\n\n<b>     EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n     As the MUSTANG powers by, the VULTURES move off the shoulder,\n     silently watching.\n\n<b>     INT. MUSTANG - DAY\n</b>\n     The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is\n     caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He\n     sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes\n     quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser\n     roars past at speed.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Fuck you!\n\n     There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick\n     cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge\n     now starts rising.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             No!...Not now!...Shit!\n\n     A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction,\n     buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.\n\n<b>     EXT. FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n     The car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of\n     an animal that won't make another hundred yards.\n\n     One sign on the larger road says \"GLOBE\" is 29 miles away. The\n     other sign, on the lesser road, tells us \"SUPERIOR\" is only 2\n     miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with \"Gas, Food, 1\n     Mile.\"\n\n     BOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the lesser\n     road towards \"Superior, Arizona.\"\n\n<b>     EXT. OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n     The car rattles on its last legs, as BOBBY mutters incantations,\n     noticing a old, ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the\n     mountains overlooking the TOWN. It's deserted now, no one\n     visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense\n     the ancient richness and power of this town. Bobby moves on.\n\n<b>     EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY\n</b>\n     Down the road from the MINING COMPANY, BOBBY'S CAR pulls into a\n     small GAS STATION, made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long\n     since dusted over. The pumps themselves look to have been\n     manufactured in the early fifties. Above the station is a sign\n     so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S.\n\n     Bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his\n     bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain,\n     he opens the hood. A plume of steam hits him in the face.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Oh shit!\n\n     Bobby looks around for someone, anyone.  After a few moments he\n     reaches into the car and blows the horn.  He waits, then blows\n     it again.  From out of the station walks DARRELL - a\n     slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty.  He\n     looks the part of a yokel.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You Harlin?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Nope.  Darrell.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Harlin around?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             He's up at the Look Out.\n\n     Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Will he be back soon?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a\n             cemetery.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You own this place?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Yep.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Then why do you call it Harlin's?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             'Cause Harlin used to own it.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             But he's dead.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             So?\n\n     Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You want to take a look at my car?  I think\n             the radiator hose is--\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.\n             Sometimes I don't even want to get out of\n             bed. Course don't want to get out for the\n             cold one's neither.  Then of course the\n             clouds come in...\n\n     Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag.  It doesn't so much\n     wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Darrell--\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look\n             at my radiator hose.  It's busted.\n\n     Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off.  He leans into the\n     car and looks at the engine.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             So?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I know it's busted.  What did I just tell\n             you?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Well, you know so much why don't you just\n             fix it yourself?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             If I could do you think I'd be standing\n             here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or\n             do I have to go somewhere else?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is\n             fifty miles from here. Only other gas\n             station down in town closed 3 years ago\n             when the mine got shut...\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you\n             fix it, or not?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Yeah, I can fix it.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Great!\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can\n             find a hose like this one, or close enough.\n             Gonna take time.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             How much time?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Time.\n\n                       BOBBY (rewinds his watch)\n             What time is it now?\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Twenty-after-ten.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be\n             ninety already.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now\n             might be seventy-two. These clouds move\n             around a lot.\n\n     Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             What happened to your hand?\n\n     Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Accident.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             You got to be more careful. Hands is\n             important.  Let me show you something. When\n             I was a kid, now I don't know if you can\n             still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a\n             lawnmower.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'm very interested in this but is there\n             someplace...\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple\n             folk like it.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be\n             careful with her, will you?\n\n     Darrell slams down the hood.\n\n<b>                       DARRELL\n</b>             Just a car.\n\n     Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which\n     he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and\n             half Mustang convertible. That's the\n             difference between you and me, and why you\n             live here and I'm just passing through.\n\n     The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from\n     Darrell, acting as a partition between them.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff\n             out of the trunk.\n\n     He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits\n     grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back\n     to the shack.\n\n     Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black\n     Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps\n     we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and\n     betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes\n     the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk.\n     Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small\n     travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan,\n     quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.\n\n<b>     INT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY\n</b>\n     DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front\n     window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the\n     road, with the bag on his shoulder.\n\n<b>     EXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER\n</b>\n     BOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign\n     saying \"SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT\n     COMMUNITY.\" As he walks on, a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on\n     their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST.  He shouts\n     after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle\n     engines.\n\n<b>     EXT. SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY\n</b>\n     BOBBY hits town, such as it is:  The Freeway left here a few\n     years back. There are only a few little stores:  A general\n     store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus\n     depot.  All of them built for the desert heat. The busiest spot\n     in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers\n     parked outside it.\n\n     At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in\n     raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian. His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next\n     to him. He's talking to TWO OLD MEN, veterans perhaps, Indian or\n     Spanish. They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive\n     alcoholic looks as Bobby passes. The Blind Man yells out in an\n     American Indian accent.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Hey!  You there!\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You want something, old man?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got\n             no respect, boy?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You want something?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Yeah I want something.  I want you to run\n             over to that machine and get me a pop.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You can't do that yourself?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm\n             blind.  Can't you see that?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'm sorry, I didn't--\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             What'd you think I was doing out here\n             with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I don't know.  I thought you were keeping\n             the sun out of your eyes.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Christ no!\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them\n             fighting the commies.  Fought the war and\n             lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so\n             you can come around here and make fun of\n             me.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I said I was sorry.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and\n             get me my pop before I die of thirst.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Yeah, sure.  You got change?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Change?  You want my change?  I fought the\n             war and lost my eyes just so I could give\n             you my change?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             All right, old man.  Christ.\n\n     Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has\n     bottles instead of cans.  The blind man shouts to Bobby.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Colas.\n             Colas ain't nothing but flavored water.\n\n     Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr.\n     Pepper.  He starts back to the blind man.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be\n             opening my own bottle.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Christ!\n\n     Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks\n     back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty\n             percent Indian, you know. To all our\n             relations.\n\n     He takes a hearty swig of the soda.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Ah!  Just what I needed!  Want some?\n\n     The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby.  A string of saliva\n     runs from his lips to the bottle's neck.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'll pass.\n\n     Bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. Flies buzz around\n     both the dog and the Blind Man.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.\n             He looks sick.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             That's 'cause he's dead.\n\n     Bobby jumps back.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Oh, Jesus.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was\n             you?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             What the hell are you keeping a dead dog\n             around for?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             He's only just dead.

That's where he belongs\n             anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not\n             anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals\n             since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was\n             just a pup then... a companion that's\n             loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no\n             matter how much you kick him...I miss him.\n             (as Bobby moves away) I'll see ya later,\n             unless I come across something worse.\n\n     Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA,\n     compulsively turns and catches up to her.  She is dressed better\n     than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a\n     mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down.  With her raven\n     hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American. Her\n     arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Can I give you a hand, beautiful?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I'm just going to my car?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             That's right on my way.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             My mother told me never to accept offers\n             from strangers.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             My name is Bobby.

Sweat starts to sheet his\n     face.\n\n                       BOBBY (panting)\n             That a fact?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I just got tired of looking at the old\n             drapes.

She\n     rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A\n     POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and\n     idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome,\n     middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast\n     to Bobby's sandiness.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Morning Grace.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Morning Sheriff.

His car overheated.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Oh?\n\n     Bobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Morning, officer.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Son.\n                  (beat, to Grace)\n             Little excitement out at the reservation\n             this morning.

GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - LATER - DAY\n</b>\n     BOBBY, naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water.  It\n     shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body.  As the\n     water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice:\n\n<b>                       VOICE(V.O.)\n</b>             I want my money.\n\n     Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady\n     himself.  His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his\n     pinky or ring finger.  Bobby leans back in the shower.  Just as\n     he does:\n\n<b>     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     It is raining hard.

One a week, punk...\n\n     Bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular GOONS.\n     Another MAN stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame.\n     With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick,\n     with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR. We\n     see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides <u>screaming</u> to\n     the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men.\n\n     As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks\n     down his ashen, blank face.\n\n<b>     INT.

Get the money or you\n             gonna lose your nose and ears.\n\n     Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his\n     left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it.  As a streak of\n     blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring\n     FINGERS have been cut off at the joints.\n\n<b>     INT.

He bends to pick\n     up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag.  As he lifts it we\n     can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is\n     3/4 filled with money.  He closes the bag and stands.  In the\n     MIRROR, hidden in the doorway, he sees GRACE watching him.  Bobby\n     slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself.  After a\n     moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.\n\n     Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down.

What are you to do, eh?\n             Women.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Can't live with them, and you can't shoot\n             'em.\n\n     Jake looks at Bobby, his lips curled into a sly smile.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             \"You can't shoot 'em!\" I like that.\n             (laughs) I bet she led you on good, didn't\n             she?  Taking you up to the house to hang\n             drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had\n             you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your\n             face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down\n             her pants and hog her out. Then me busting\n             in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a\n             fire going under you.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Like you don't know.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I\n             can tell you got a temper on you.\n\n     Bobby gives a little laugh.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right\n             then, didn't you?  Bet you just wanted to\n             kill her.\n\n     Bobby starts to laugh heartily.  Jake joins in, then stops\n     abruptly.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Would you?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Would I what?\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Would you kill her?\n\n     Bobby starts to laugh. Bobby stops laughing.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Because I'm sick and tired of her little\n             games.  Because you could do it and drift\n             away on your boat and no one would ever see\n             you again.  Because I've got a\n             fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy\n             on her, and I would be more than happy to\n             give the man who does her in a good chunk\n             of it.\n\n     For a moment Bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of\n     the offer.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I've done a few things but I'm not a\n             murderer, Mr. McKenna.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             How do you know if you've never tried?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             This is a joke, right?

What the fuck is drink in\n             Spanish ... uh, agua?\n\n     The old woman's eyes widen.  She starts to scream, but quickly\n     clamps her hands over her mouth.  For a moment Bobby thinks the\n     woman is screaming at what he has said.  Then, as if he feels a\n     presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO\n     tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered BIKERS.  One holds a\n     gun.\n\n<b>                       BIKER\n</b>             That's right, lady.  Keep it in you and\n             nobody gets hurt.  That goes for you too,\n             stud.

She hands the money to the biker.\n\n<b>                       BIKER\n</b>             That's it?

Whatcha got? Give it, now.\n\n     Bobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant\n     pocket, tosses it on the counter.\n\n                       BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)\n             Nice...Just who <u>are you</u> beautiful? What\n             else you got for papa?\n\n     Bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him.\n\n<b>                       BIKER\n</b>             Better...you're getting tasty.

Bobby flinches in anticipation of a\n     shot but refuses to let go of the bag.  The biker swings the gun\n     hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.  Bobby falls against\n     the counter and to the floor.  The woman starts to scream. The\n     biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a\n     ring on her finger.  He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring.\n     The woman screams wildly.\n\n<b>                       SECOND BIKER\n</b>             Let's go, man.\n\n<b>                       BIKER\n</b>             A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you\n             just relax.\n\n<b>                       WOMAN\n</b>             No!

The woman\n     fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the\n     biker.  He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of\n     blood and shredded money.\n\n<b>                      SECOND BIKER\n</b>             Bugger! You bitch!\n\n     The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place\n     out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at\n     the old woman, who ducks behind the counter.\n\n     The Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not\n     expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND\n     BLAST into him and the bag.\n\n     Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to\n     shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead.\n\n     Bobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds.\n\n                       WOMAN (cursing in Spanish)\n             Hijos de puta.

He cups his hands under the\n     water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut\n     above his eye. The SHERIFF'S CAR goes wailing by on the main\n     drag. Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another\n     drink. A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet. He jumps back.\n\n<b>     EXT.

A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated\n     on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin.\n\n<b>                       ED\n</b>             One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was\n             back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon\n             it dropped down to forty three! True story.\n\n<b>                       BOYD\n</b>             One time last year I remember it went from\n             98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come\n             out like...\n\n     BOBBY comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the\n     counter.  He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a\n     mess. He buries his face in the menu.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You got a beer?\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             What kind?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Beck's.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             No Beck's. A-1, Coors...\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Heineken?\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got\n             Miller.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Genuine Draft?\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can\n             fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave\n             it.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'll fuckin' take it. To go.\n\n<b>                       SHORT ORDER COOK\n</b>             Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             I'll be right back with that beer.\n\n     Flo moves off.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             ...and a waitress named Flo.  Christ.\n\n     As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he\n     hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE\n     RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot.  He\n     looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg.  He gives it\n     a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Fucking cat.\n\n     In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth.  TOBY looks the\n     part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  His hair is\n     cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school.  His\n     girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is\n     the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look.\n     Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom.  After he\n     is gone Jenny walks to Bobby.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the\n             juke?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             What?\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a\n             quarter?\n\n     Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and\n     flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             What happened to your hand?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more\n             careful.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Got any requests?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             That country shit all sounds the same to\n             me.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             How about I pick one out for you?\n\n     Bobby half smiles.  Jenny plays a song.  Patsy Cline's \"Your\n     Cheatin' Heart.\"  Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.\n             How come, I wonder, she don't put out no\n             more new records.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Cause she's dead.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I've had time to get over it.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             You're not from around here, are you?\n             Where you from?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Oz.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You're too quick for me.\n\n     Toby walks back into the room.  He looks at Jenny.  He looks at\n     Bobby.  He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby.  He loses it.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not\n             believin'...Stop the wedding.  This can't\n             be. Hey!  What are you doing with my girl?\n\n     Bobby says nothing, ignoring Toby.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             I axed you a question.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was\n             just talking.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             You shut your mouth, girl, and get back\n             over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not\n             going to axe you again, Mister.  What were\n             you doing with my girl?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I wasn't doing anything.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked\n             to me like you was trying to make time with\n             her.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Make time?  Is everybody in this town on\n             drugs?\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a\n             quarter for the jukebox.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's\n             business to take care of. I ain't never\n             taken no drugs, mister, and ...\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I\n             wasn't making a play for your girl.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             You expect me to believe that?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I don't care what you believe as long as\n             you leave me alone.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             Mister, I'm calling you out.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             What?  You want to fight?  Over her?\n\n     Bobby looks Jenny over.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the\n             man alone.\n\n                       TOBY (to Bobby)\n             You know who I am?  Toby N. Tucker.\n             Everyone round here call me TNT. You know\n             why?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Let's see...they're not very imaginative?\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I\n             go off, somebody gets hurt.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Fine.  I was making time with your girl.\n             Now I'm scared to death and I learned my\n             lesson. Now can you go away?\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Christ, I don't believe this!\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             Stand up.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I wasn't hitting on your girl!\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where\n             you sit.\n\n     Bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with Toby now\n     with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either. He\n     sits there.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             Toby, you stop it now!

This is gonna\n             be over real quick.\n\n     Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching\n     their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move.\n     The tension builds.  We see it on the faces of Jenny, Flo and\n     the regulars.  Just then the record on the juke ends and the\n     needle scratches off.  There is the crackle of a police radio as\n     the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in.\n     The tension eases. Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to\n     Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear.\n\n<b>                       TOBY\n</b>             You're lucky, Mister.  Don't think it's\n             over.  I called you out and I'm gonna see\n             this through.  You hear me? (to Jenny)\n             Come on, girl.  I got half a mind to make\n             you walk home.\n\n     Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil,\n             has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             What was that all about?\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every\n             man he sees is after his Jenny.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             More like Jenny is after every man she\n             sees.\n\n                       FLO (to Bobby)\n             You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to\n             show off for his girl.  Give him a couple\n             of hours, he'll cool off.  Still want that\n             beer?\n\n                       BOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff)\n             I'll take it to go.\n\n     Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his\n     forehead.\n\n<b>                       ED\n</b>             How's it with you, Sheriff?\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Already started out bad.  Couple of bikers\n             from out of town tried to knock over\n             Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It\n             was a real shootout.\n\n<b>                       BOYD\n</b>             What happened?\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             The old witch killed 'em both.\n\n<b>                       ED\n</b>             Holy shit!\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             Poor thing.

He looks around to make sure he is\n     not being watched.  Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer.\n     It gets closer and closer.  As he is about to grab the money\n     there, the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses\n     and claws at his hand.  Bobby jumps back startled.\n\n<b>                       FLO\n</b>             Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the\n             nice man like that?  Sorry about that,\n             mister.

SERGEI, his goon in a shiny polyester shirt, hovers over\n     his boss helping feed and manicure him.  These are the TWO MEN\n     from Bobby's earlier FLASHBACK.  They are dangerous in an\n     endearing way.  Sergei answers the phone. In the background is a\n     very voluptuous female, obviously from the Middle East.

Shit! Damn! Damn!\n             Damn!\n\n     He marches from the phone booth, past an old HARDWARE STORE. The\n     phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice:\n\n<b>                       VOICE(V.O.)\n</b>             Thank you for using AT&amp;T.\n\n     In the store window, Bobby notices a set of garden shears for\n     sale.\n\n<b>     EXT. EMPTY STREET - LATER DAY\n</b>\n     BOBBY walks a bit going nowhere in particular.  Looking at his\n     watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand\n     from the sun.  At the side of an old building, in the bit of\n     shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and\n     won't turn.  Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as\n     the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates.\n     Bobby yells in pain.  At the same time the beer comes foaming\n     from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve. The bottle slips\n     from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying. He\n     clutches his bleeding hand, pissed.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town!\n             I hate it!

GRACE\n     looks pretty hot up there in the driver's seat, her eyes, behind\n     sunglasses, flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she\n     keeps going.\n\n     Bobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but\n     unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices -- across the\n     street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and\n     signage, reading \"McKenna's Realty Co.\"\n\n     He thinks about it, in a quandary.\n\n<b>     EXT.

I grew up on a\n             reservation.  The sun, the desert; they\n             like a religion to us.  Jake's the same\n             way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're\n             alike that way.

I grew up on\n             a reservation. A patch of desert in the\n             middle of nowhere. That's where they stick\n             Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us\n             to die. My brother killed himself when he\n             was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore.\n             There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket\n             out. Mom and me.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Is that why you're with him?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I let him think he was courtin' me, but I\n             reeled him in like a fish on a line. I\n             wanted him. I wanted what he could give me,\n             and I would've done anything to get him. Is\n             that love?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I'm guessing no.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Yeah, I guess you're right.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I take it things didn't much work out the\n             way you planned.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I'm still here, aren't I?

He says he don't mind\n             being nothing but a big fish in a small\n             pond.

It's not like I wouldn't\n             try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.\n             I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I\n             guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I\n             tried to sucker you along like that.  Do\n             you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you\n             if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:\n             You just got to do whatever it takes to get\n             out.\n\n                       BOBBY (soft echo)\n             Whatever it takes.\n\n     Grace steps to the edge of the plateau.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I wish I was a bird.  I know it's stupid.\n             Every child says that.  When I was growing\n             up some of the old ones on the reservation\n             believed people could actually change into\n             animals.  I wish I could.\n\n     We see Bobby behind Grace.  He stares at her standing on the\n     edge of the plateau.  He rises and walks towards her slowly, but\n     with deliberation.\n\n<b>                       GRACE(CONT)\n</b>             If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to\n             Disney World.  I always wanted to go there.\n             I'd fly to New York.  Maybe.  I guess New\n             York isn't the best place to be a bird.\n             I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all\n             over Texas.  Then I'd fly to California.  I\n             guess by then I'd have seen it all and I\n             could die.\n\n     Bobby now stands a few feet behind Grace.  She kicks a rock and\n     watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness\n     below.\n\n<b>                       GRACE(CONT)\n</b>             They say you don't feel anything.  The\n             shock kills you before you hit the ground.\n             I don't know how they would know that.  But\n             I heard it's just like flying; straight\n             down into the ground.  I guess if it\n             doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.\n\n     Bobby tenses himself.  Sweat forms on his brow as he stands\n     directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him.  They\n     hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward.\n     Suddenly Grace wheels.  Startled by Bobby she almost falls over\n     the edge.  Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back.\n     Grace's life is literally in his hands.  She looks down at the\n     ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes.  She shows no fear,\n     but instead wears a curious smirk.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Hate's a funny thing.  Right now I bet you\n             don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck\n             me.\n\n     Bobby hesitates, then pulls Grace close and kisses her with\n     great ardor on the lips.\n\n<b>     EXT.

He kept Mom on\n             the side y'know, cause he was married\n             someplace else.

He loved to do things to me. Believe\n             it or not, he used to say he was in love\n             with my ass.

I liked being controlled by\n             Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as\n             he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all\n             the way. Women say they don't want to be\n             taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit\n             -- they do. The first time he finished with\n             me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14.\n             Then he started crying like a baby...wanted\n             me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to\n             hate someone so much for so many years, but\n             still want to hold him, comfort him... They\n             found my Mom right down there (points) at\n             the bottom of Apache Leap.

DESERT/ALONG THE ROAD - LATER DAY\n</b>\n     BOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a\n     rage. Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones, buzzes, and\n     clicks. A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush. A VOICE\n     whispers to him.\n\n<b>                       JAKE (V.O.)\n</b>             You've got the killing in you, boy.\n\n     Bobby turns and looks around. Just desert.

STREET CORNER - DAY\n</b>\n     In a news pot, further down the street from where he was first\n     seen, the old, BLIND MAN sits with his dead DOG, speaking as if\n     into camera, sipping on a Dr. Pepper.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             It's the desert that makes you crazy. The\n             loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to.\n             People on the run. Trailer parks. White\n             trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot\n             day.  I seen a scorpion sting itself to\n             death.  It just keeps driving its tail into\n             its body again and again.  A little killer\n             killing itself.  Seen a coyote kill itself\n             too.  Just kept on biting and tearing at\n             its own legs.  Near tore one clean off\n             before it bled to death.  And what a white\n             man'll do when it's freezing one moment,\n             hot as hell the next. A man could get\n             hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders\n             with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy\n             kiss. Nice pussy y'see, see it coming. I\n             don't know what it is about the desert. I\n             figger it's sort of like putting a kettle\n             of water over a fire.  People is mostly\n             water.  We boil when it's hot.  'Cept when\n             we boil the water's got no place to go.  It\n             just churns inside of us until we can cool\n             off.  If it's not too late.\n\n     BOBBY is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we\n     realize the blind man has been talking to him all along. Bobby\n     sips a Dr. Pepper as well.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You sure seen a lot for a blind man.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I\n             can't see.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             That a fact?\n\n     Bobby noticing now all the little NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that the\n     Blind Man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             I can see just fine.  For example:  You're\n             a young man who thinks he's got someplace\n             to be.\n\n     A POLICE RADIO crackles, Bobby tensing.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Maybe I do.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Or maybe you just think you do.

It gets\n             down to one thing -- are you a human being\n             or are you one of those hungry ghosts out\n             there never satisfied with nothing?

Suddenly the blind man\n     stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police\n     radio in it.\n\n     As SHERIFF POTTER cruises by, glancing at Bobby shrinking. The\n     car goes on up the street.\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you.\n             Always sneaking around.

Grown men cried like babies. I saw a\n             flash, then darkness descended upon me.\n             They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I\n             cursed them. White people can't seem to\n             stay away from Indians (grabs his bandaged\n             hand, smelling the blood). You gotta watch\n             where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy\n             pussy, Indian pussy.\n\n     It sounds demented. Bobby, checking him out to see if he's\n     really blind, walks quietly around him during this monologue and\n     peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind man's real eyes.\n     Although he thinks the Blind Man thinks he's on the other side\n     of him, the Blind Man fools him by suddenly swivelling around\n     and cranking a gob of spit into Bobby's face as if Bobby were on\n     the other side.\n\n     Bobby, pissed, wipes the spittle from his face.\n\n                       BLIND MAN (finishing)\n             ...but they gotta know you don't fuck\n             around with Indians.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I thought you said you lost your eyes in\n             the war?\n\n<b>                       BLIND MAN\n</b>             So now you're going to tell me where I lost\n             my eyes.

And then you\n             show up...\n\n     The Sheriff looks right through Bobby, who knows this is more\n     than a conversation. He pulls up to Harlin's garage.

Is she selling\n     him out? He's very confused, turbulent.\n\n<b>     INT. BUS DEPOT - LATER DAY\n</b>\n     BOBBY enters the BUS DEPOT.  The interior is poorly lit.  There\n     are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty.\n     Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall.  A bored FEMALE\n     CLERK is behind the counter.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I need a ticket.\n\n<b>                       CLERK\n</b>             Where to?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Out of here.\n\n<b>                       CLERK\n</b>             But, in particular?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I ...

He seems delirious. She\n     goes through her schedule looking for a bus.\n\n<b>                       CLERK\n</b>             How about Ciudad Juarez?

He glances back.\n\n     His POV - sure enough, the SHERIFF'S having a field day. He's\n     just pulled SERGEI over. At this distance, we catch snippets of\n     conversation as the Sheriff ambles from his car, checking\n     Sergei's out-of-state plates.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Where's the fire sweetheart?

I am\n             looking town. I not even moving.\n\n     We pop in closer to their conversation -- Bobby relishing this\n     in his mind's eye. Sergei is constantly looking off to where he\n     last saw Bobby. But the Sheriff, strangely, pays no attention to\n     these looks.\n\n<b>                       SHERIFF\n</b>             Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?\n             You one of them Russians?\n\n<b>                       SERGEI\n</b>             I am Russian, da!

Though still under\n     considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with\n     Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new\n     today -- some luck.\n\n     The icy cold soda bottle shoots out. Bobby raises it to his\n     lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once. Violently it\n     explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain\n     from a KIDNEY PUNCH. He stumbles forward into the soda machine,\n     gasping. The legs of his assailant are close to him, but the\n     face is unseen.\n\n     Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the\n     brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound.

The\n     world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare.  A primal rage\n     wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the\n     soda bottle up out of nowhere across Toby's head, smashing him\n     backwards. Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on\n     the boy's face and head.\n\n     Jenny screams:\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             Stop it!

His\n     bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs\n     the pain.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>             You killed him!

She knows that hidden there is a\n     key, and she fixes on it intently.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             What the hell you looking at, girl?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Nothing, Jake.

The DOG struggles to its feet and they walk off down\n     the street together.\n\n<b>     INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock.

Fear coming into his eyes.\n     He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or\n     forgiveness.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Oh baby, I'm so sorry...

MCKENNA HOUSE/BACKDOOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens.  BOBBY slips\n     quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the\n     door behind him.  It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no\n     bearings.  He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the\n     darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only\n     to catch it just before it crashes into the floor.\n\n<b>     INT.

Come on\n             baby, keep going.\n\n     Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a\n     drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark\n     metallic OBJECT.\n\n                       GRACE (realizing)\n             What's that?

He hops\n     silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and\n     listens.  Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the\n     darkness.  A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see\n     the barrel of his own black .9mm BARETTA pressed against his\n     forehead.  JAKE appears now, backing him into the living room.\n     He switches on a LAMP.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Well, well.  As I live and breathe.

Give me\n             two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the\n             body where no one will ever find it. She\n             showed me the perfect place. There won't be\n             enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the\n             the money.  I've got to have the money.\n\n     Jake is silent.  He takes his time thinking.  Finally:\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             She's in the bedroom.\n\n<b>     INT. HALLWAY\n</b>\n     GRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom.\n\n<b>     INT.

Go to work.\n\n     Bobby holds up his eight fingers with a \"you try\" look. Jake\n     shrugs. Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             How 'bout the pipe?\n\n                       JAKE (sarcastic)\n             She's got a slender neck.\n\n     Bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom. Jake follows into an\n     adjoining room.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Hold on a second!

Now you make straight for it.\n\n<b>     INT. HALLWAY\n</b>\n     GRACE returns to listen. This thing is like a seesaw battle of\n     wills.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY (V.O.)\n</b>             Come on, Jake --\n\n<b>                       JAKE (V.O.)\n</b>             Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You\n             probably didn't even make it out to the\n             desert this afternoon...\n\n<b>     INT.

Fucking\n             her behind my back, that's another!\n\n     Suddenly Jake swings his arm, clipping Bobby across the side of\n     the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash.\n\n     Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out.\n\n     Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and\n     smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss. The blood\n     from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's\n     lips.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             <u>Now</u> you've tasted <u>both</u> of us!\n\n     He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobby's\n     head. Bobby sees it coming, plays his last card on his knees.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her!

Maybe just long\n             enough to leave the door unlocked?  Is that\n             what happened?\n\n<b>     INT.

Do it, boy. <u>Kill her</u>.\n\n     Bobby goes.\n\n<b>     INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS\n</b>\n     GRACE bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she\n     flies.\n\n<b>     INT. BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)\n</b>\n     BOBBY walks it. His POV -- the door. Every step seems freighted.\n\n<b>     INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS\n</b>\n     GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in\n     to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure.\n\n     She looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it\n     down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in\n     the boxes. Suddenly she finds it.\n\n     A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off\n     its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of\n     splitting a skull or impaling flesh.\n\n     Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind\n     the door.\n\n     A moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly\n     enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as\n     to whether he can kill her.\n\n     In a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as\n     victim...closer, closer.  He now lifts the edge of the bedcover\n     but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure.\n\n     He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her\n     presence. He spins.\n\n     She's <u>directly behind him</u>, hatchet raised. His life is in her\n     hands.\n\n     His eyes, locked in an eternal moment.\n\n     Her eyes, the hatchet.\n\n<b>                                                     SNAP CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

Then...\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Jake!\n\n     It is a desperate cry for help. Jake can't help himself. He\n     breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Grace!!\n\n<b>     INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS\n</b>\n     JAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned,\n     sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken.\n     Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a\n     pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves\n     in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet...  Over\n     there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET.\n     The look on her face is pure shock.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Well...looks like you got him, Grace.\n             That's good...that's real good.  He must of\n             slipped past me, but you got him.  Looks\n             like that drifter from this morning.  Got\n             to be careful who you make friends with,\n             sweetheart.\n\n     Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Why don't you put that down? It's all over\n             now.  Put it down.\n\n     Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Go on, girl.  Put it down.\n\n     What choice does Grace have?  She lets the hatchet clank to the\n     floor.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let\n             someone get the best of her.  That's what I\n             love about you.  As dangerous as you are\n             unpredictable.\n\n     behind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very\n     much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is\n     staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin\n     slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire.\n\n     Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and\n     drives it straight into his back.\n\n     He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to\n     kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the\n     rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once,\n     discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back.\n\n     Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged\n     rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back.\n     An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.\n\n     Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around,\n     Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his\n     hands full.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Grace, goddamit, do something!\n\n     Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for\n     help.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Grace...?\n\n     She commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side\n     she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor,\n     strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's\n     a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its\n     toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead,\n     but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as\n     Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away.\n     But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on\n     her knees across the floor.\n\n     She grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two\n     men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand,\n     no longer sure which way she'll go.\n\n     Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping\n     from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that\n     she will help him. He gasps the words.\n\n<b>                       JAKE\n</b>             Help me, Grace, help...\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Like you helped her, Jake?\n\n     Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her\n     hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men.\n\n     It flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake,\n     almost transfixing him to the floor.\n\n     In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers.\n     But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare.\n\n     Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls\n     back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             What the hell'd you wait for?\n\n     She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body\n     off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of\n     it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new\n     territory, feeling an apartness between them.\n\n     Suddenly <u>JAKE gasps</u>, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He\n     grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one\n     last time.\n\n     Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on\n     her knees and prying open several floorboards.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             The money's right here! Get the key!\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             No! You get it!\n\n     He doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to\n     his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The\n     action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the\n     floor. She runs back to the floorboards.\n\n     The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed.\n\n     Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the\n     outcome.\n\n     With the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles\n     of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him,\n     offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on\n     his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the\n     fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery\n     store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.\n\n     They see each other.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Didn't I tell you?\n\n                       BOBBY (plunging into the cash)\n             There must be 150, 200 thousand here!\n             Goddamnit Grace, you were right!\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!\n\n     They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of\n     cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back. The day\n     didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Fuck me baby!\n\n                       BOBBY (looking at Jake)\n             What about him?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Let him watch. I want him to know what he's\n             missing.\n\n     As they consummate their violent relationship for the first\n     time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them.\n\n<b>     EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT\n</b>\n     The LIGHT in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense\n     something watching them. GRACE's silhouette moves across a\n     window.\n\n     BOBBY now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the\n     driveway.\n\n     He stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of GRACE'S JEEP.\n\n     He reaches into the ENGINE and disconnects something, then\n     closes the hood and walks on.\n\n<b>     EXT.

I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I\n             married him!... I married him...okay?\n\n     She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her. Finally:\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Why?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             <u>I don't know why</u>!\n\n     She drops back in her seat. Tears come.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             All I wanted was to be a kid... He took\n             that from me... They all did... (very\n             quietly, dangerously) They treated me like\n             meat. A piece of meat. <u>Fuck me</u>. <u>Blow me</u>.\n             <u>Bend over</u>. <u>Stick their fingers up my ass</u>...\n             Fuck them! Fuck the whole town!

She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said\n     she could.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             It's easy to judge someone else when you\n             don't know nothing about it...

Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through\n     the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I don't want to think anymore.\n\n                       GRACE (quietly)\n             Then drive...\n\n     The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness.\n\n<b>                                                THE SUN COMES UP:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. CANYON - END SPOT - DAWN\n</b>\n     In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where VULTURES circle\n     in a hot white sky, we find the MUSTANG parked at the edge of a\n     drop. We hear the SOUND of a body being dragged.\n\n<b>                       D.J.

Hey area weather is\n             gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold!\n             Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every\n             day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're\n             planning on anything, <u>don't</u>. You don't like\n             the weather, just wait one minute.

Drop it there.

God bless.\n\n     Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting. The body crashes below.\n     It's hard work. They head back for the Mustang, to retrieve\n     JAKE'S body in the popped trunk. But Grace notices Bobby\n     glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist.\n\n     The silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel\n     crunching under their shoes as they walk.\n\n                       GRACE (indicates the gun)\n             Is this what's bothering you Bobby?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             No Grace, my hand's bothering me.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             You think now that Jake's dead, there's all\n             that money there and I don't need you\n             anymore, and I might just sneak up behind\n             you sometime and...pop!\n\n     She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby, mimicking the recoil of\n     a gun. Bobby is nervous.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted\n             to?

She can't help feeling some old\n     feelings. As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off\n     the annoying radio. He watches as she softly prays over Jake,\n     whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled.\n\n                       GRACE (after a moment with Jake)\n             What do you think happens to someone's\n             spirit when they die?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I think nothing happens.

There\n             is nothing else.\n                  (lifting Jake by the shoulder)\n             Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.\n\n     Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his\n     move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard. He slams her\n     hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground,\n     dazed.\n\n     He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it.\n\n     She puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger\n     tips. She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts\n     into Bobby like a knife.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you\n             motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach\n             you anything...?\n\n     Her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing. Her\n     calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Well?\n\n     For a moment, Bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through\n     his belt.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the\n             money, then you're on your own.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Don't leave me.

Bobby, I had to\n             tell him that to get his guard down. Just\n             like you told Jake you was going to kill\n             me!\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You lied to me all along!

I wish you had told me the\n             goddamn truth in the first place!\n\n                       GRACE (screws out)\n             I didn't <u>want</u> you to know! Don't you...\n             unnerstand?\n\n     Bobby's got a headache now. It's too much to understand, too\n     much talk. Too much history has taught him to doubt.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             When you're finished with me, I'm next! I\n             been there, baby. I been there with other\n             cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you\n             as far as California. If we can make that.\n             After that you're on your own. Try Mexico.\n             With all this bread, you can live like a\n             queen.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby!\n             Please, I really want to be with you.

It blocks\n             your heart.\n\n     Keeping a wary eye on Grace, Bobby starts hauling Jake out of\n     the trunk.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Give me a hand.\n\n     He wrestles Jake up to a sitting position. He grabs a can of\n     beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a\n     pocket of Jake's coat.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with\n             the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em\n             ended up dead.\n\n     Grace takes his boots.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Time to go for a walk, Jake.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             My mother died in this canyon.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It\n             doesn't work with me. One, two, three...\n\n     They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the\n     edge of the drop. As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of\n     Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of\n     separation.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might\n             be months before they find these guys. If\n             at all. I mean with the mountain lions\n             around here. Remember, if they can't find\n             no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't\n             respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose\n             this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico\n             are big countries, all that money Grace,\n             you'll meet someone else, you know, there's\n             a lot of hope with a $100,000...\n\n     They lift Jake again, and move to the edge.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Hope is a four-letter word.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             But we all need that too. Hold him.\n\n     He props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight\n     onto Grace. Jake's head is on her shoulder.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You make a pretty couple.\n\n     It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun,\n     wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows\n             who it's registered to.  You shoulda been\n             more careful, Jake. See you later.\n\n     As he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop.\n\n     Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back\n     momentarily to her, also watching. She moves towards him.\n\n     Bobby turns, slips on the edge.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Now all we got to do is try <u>and</u>--\n\n     He feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is\n     falling...falling, his life coming to an end.\n\n     Grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. Did she push\n     him? He doesn't know.\n\n     He's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake\n     and Virgil. He screams out in sharp pain. His leg feels broken.\n     But he is alive.\n\n     Grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. She must\n     get away from the past and all these hollow men. She closes the\n     trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the\n     ignition key. Her hand fumbles for it a moment. It isn't there.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Shit!\n\n     She sits there. Bobby is calling from below.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through\n             too much together.  We've only had one day,\n             but you and me have been through more than\n             most people ever will. I know you were\n             angry at me, and, you know, you were right!\n             I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about\n             leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.\n\n     She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff,\n     looks down.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Thank you. Thank you.

Are you all right?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I busted my leg!\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Can you make it back up?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow\n             rope. It should reach down here. Go get it,\n             throw it down.\n\n     She looks. Of course the trunk is closed. She closed it.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the\n             keys up to me. I'll get the rope.\n\n     Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring\n     upwards in death. They take in the gun still attached to his\n     waist. He knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took Jake out.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I can't throw that far. You got to climb\n             down here and get the keys. You can make\n             it. It's the only way Grace.\n\n     Grace looks down at the drop.  It's a tough descent but she\n     knows she could make it and get back up as well.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             Grace!...Please, Grace!  You have to help\n             me.\n\n     Grace takes a look around.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!\n\n     She starts down the cliff face. As she descends, he talks\n     deliriously.\n\n                       BOBBY (off)\n             I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't\n             leave me baby, cause we're tied together\n             too close. We belong together always.\n\n     Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously\n     towards Bobby.\n\n                       GRACE (yelling back, echoing)\n             Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do\n             this alone. I know you don't trust me, but\n             you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not\n             gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go\n             down like this. It was different with you\n             Bobby. You had dreams like me. You\n             listened... I would've gone anywhere with\n             you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm\n             sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt\n             you.\n\n     Can he believe her? She sounds so sincere this time.\n\n     She's heading for the body of Jake. And the gun. Bobby knows\n     that and is already crawling there.\n\n                       BOBBY (as he crawls)\n             They're right here, Grace.  The keys.  Come\n             get me out of here... Know why else I could\n             never leave you?\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             Why's that?\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>            'Cause I love you.\n\n     Inching closer.\n\n     Closer. They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse.\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             And I love you too.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I\n             don't know if I want to love you...\n\n     Grace leans close to Bobby.  He dangles the keys out in front of\n     her, but she doesn't reach for them. Her eyes go to Bobby. She\n     reaches for him. At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and\n     clamp hard around her.  A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace\n     as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             ...<u>or kill you</u>.\n\n     Grace twists and flails in Bobby's hands, but in spite of his\n     bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             I love you Grace, but <u>I just can't trust</u>\n             <u>you</u>!\n\n     She looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head. Grace's\n     flailing goes into overdrive. Somewhere in his semi-delirious\n     state, Bobby's eyes might notice the gun at Jake's waist is no\n     longer there.\n\n     Grace manages one word:\n\n<b>                       GRACE\n</b>             <u>Jake</u>...\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!\n\n     Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he\n     kills that which he loves.\n\n     Suddenly, a SHOT is heard. Bobby buckles with the blast, hit in\n     the side. He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his\n     hands, breaking her neck.\n\n     Bobby looks down at Jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand,\n     and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows\n     from it.  He manages to stand, looks at Jake; their bodies lying\n     side by side.\n\n     Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to\n     the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with\n     blood.\n\n     He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the\n     driver's seat. He checks the money in the bag. All there. All\n     his.\n\n     As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures\n     circle. Perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by. It\n     spooks Bobby but he's okay. He looks in the mirror.\n\n<b>                       BOBBY\n</b>             You're still lucky.\n\n     He puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life.\n\n                       BOBBY (waves back)\n             Adios --\n\n     Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart\n     loudly. Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a\n     cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. He shakes his\n     head, frustrated.\n\n                       BOBBY (sighs)\n             Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.\n\n     He can't help but laugh at his bad luck. As we rise off the\n     desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually\n     leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of\n     Arizona.\n\n\n\n<b>                            THE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n     </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>U Turn</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Ridley\" title=\"Scripts by John Ridley\">John Ridley</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Richard Rutowski\" title=\"Scripts by Richard Rutowski\">Richard Rutowski</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Oliver Stone\" title=\"Scripts by Oliver Stone\">Oliver Stone</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/U Turn Script.html#comments\" title=\"U Turn comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:18:59.122803"}
