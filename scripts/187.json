ADJUST ANGLE now\n<br/>    to meet the bicyclist...\n<br/>\n<br/>    He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears\n<br/>    wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased\n<br/>    slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at\n<br/>    once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass\n<br/>    on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.\n<br/>\n<br/>    ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade\n<br/>    bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind\n<br/>    him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.\n<br/>\n<br/>    Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.\n<br/>    above the East River.\n<br/>\n<br/>    A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks\n<br/>    back and forth as he pumps the pedals.\n<br/>\n<br/>    FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the\n<br/>    bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour\n<br/>    traffic on the bridge below.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>2   EXT.

The police at this point\n<br/>                   aren't even sure if it's a case of\n<br/>                   murder. The reason we're having\n<br/>                   this meeting tonight is to quash\n<br/>                   all the rumors floating around out\n<br/>                   there. Okay. Here's what we do\n<br/>                   know. Benny Chacon ultimately died\n<br/>                   from a drug overdose, technically\n<br/>                   it was morphine.\n<br/>                           (volume rising again)\n<br/>                   Which is what heroin breaks down\n<br/>                   into...\n<br/>\n<br/>                                 STEVIE (O.S.)\n<br/>                   ...

Ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside\n<br/>      one of the doors at the back of the hall...\n<br/>\n<br/>      Up at the dais, Trevor notices her.\n<br/>\n<br/>                                 STEVIE\n<br/>                   It's not the gangbangers y'gotta\n<br/>                   worry about. It's the teachers!\n<br/>\n<br/>                                 MR.

Maybe I can't prove it but I\n<br/>                   know he did it.
