MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY\n\n\nThe highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men\nimposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK\nCRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.\nHis suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white\nsleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late\nthirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-\nlet shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from\na glass of iced tea. Then:\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n           I should have caught you at the boat\n           yard when you got off work.

The prints\n           are all smooth gloves. He's on a\n           full moon cycle. Both times.

Two\n snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck\n carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family\n behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.\n\n\n CLOSE: GRAHAM\n\n looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he\n puts them down and looks along the beach.\n\n\n GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN\n\n KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the\n water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.\n MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands\n watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen\n around her ankles. Her body language openly states\n hostility. It's towards Crawford.\n\n                           GRAHAM (O.S.)\n            Let's talk after dinner.

All\nare mouthing silently: \"Happy Birthday to you, happy birth-\nday to you...\" Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath\nher breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's\nsmiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds\nruns into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his\nwife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He\nlooks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to\nthe camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy\nblows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera\na large yellow envelope that says: \"Follow the ribbon.\" A\nbig yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.\n11.\n\nThe camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to\nfollow the ribbon...

The\nshadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high\nresolution, highly brilliant sec of images.

After placing the\nnozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,\ndraws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout\ninto the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he\nstarts to move around the van he sees something in the\ninterior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't\nknow what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He\nwipes and wipes the same spot.\n\n\nREBA'S\n\ndress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.\nHer legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.\nFrom his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can\nlook up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...\n\n\nMEN'S ROOM DOOR\n\nNothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel\nand throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the\nbackside of the van.\n\n\nDRIVER'S WINDOW\n\nDollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on\nthe dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...\n\n\nATTENDANT\n\nunaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same\nspot in front of Reba.\n\n\nDOLLARHYDE\n\n\nis coming around the van.

You know what\n      you can do about it...\n\nAttendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him\ninto and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once\nand slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...\nDollarhyde does know what he can do about it.\n\n\nREBA'S FACE\n\nthrough the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to\nroll down the window.\n\n\nATTENDANT\n\nis white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has\nnever seen before, anywhere.\n\n\nDOLLARHYDE\n\npulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He\nadvances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end\nof the spout.\n\n\nATTENDANT\n\nis wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the\nman into the wall, compressing his thorax.\n\n               DOLLARHYDE\n      I ought to jam this in your chest,\n      and drain your heart...\n\nThe Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.\nDollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then\nhe throws money at the Attendant and leaves...\n\n                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Nothing falls on the bed.\nMr. Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs. Leeds' pillow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n108.\n\nMrs. Leeds is on her side. Slowly she starts to rise. She\nsees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream.\nA silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood\nstarts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We\nFLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.\nSomething massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is\ngone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand\ncovered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face\nturns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light\nemanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She\nreally wants us. Her hand gestures us closer. As we MOVE\nCLOSER we hear:\n\n                GRAHAM (O.S.)\n      You will be better than anything...\n      anything I have ever known.
