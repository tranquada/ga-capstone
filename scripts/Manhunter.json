He touches the side of her cheek and\nher hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make\ncloser contact.\n\n<b>               GRAHAM\n</b>      We did okay.\n           (beat)\n      Most of them made it...\n\n\n<b>REARSHOT: GRAHAM + MOLLY\n</b>\nGraham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm\nacross Molly's shoulder. Molly's arm moves around Graham's\nwaist. They look out to sea. In front of them, the surf\nkicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant\natoms.\n\n\n<b>                          THE END\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Manhunter</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Thomas Harris\" title=\"Scripts by Thomas Harris\">Thomas Harris</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Mann\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Mann\">Michael Mann</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Manhunter Script.html#comments\" title=\"Manhunter comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:11:04.452517"}
