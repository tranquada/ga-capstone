That's five points.\r\n           - Another two points when you\r\n           convert the try by kicking the ball\r\n           through the uprights.\r\n           - Three points for a penalty kick.\r\n           - Three points for a drop kick.\r\n           - Have you got all that?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          KIDS\r\n</b>           No!\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER\r\n</b>           Agh, bugger it, let's just run and\r\n           pass.

Even the grumpiest, most\r\n          conservative Springbok.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SPRINGBOK LOCK\r\n</b>           Okay.

The crowd of kids around him is\r\n          twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's\r\n          basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming.\r\n          The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow\r\n          Pienaar.\r\n                         \r\n          AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at\r\n          Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't\r\n          just hold it, he feels it.\r\n          END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a\r\n          horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls\r\n          under their arms.\r\n                         \r\n          One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and\r\n          the bus slowly accelerates away.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          CUT TO:\r\n</b><b>           80.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT.

ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is\r\n          two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and\r\n          seals. It would be pretty --\r\n                         \r\n          -- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed\r\n          wire, guard towers.\r\n                         \r\n          (In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the\r\n          island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still\r\n          had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist\r\n          destination.)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.
