The school moves on as if nothing happened,\n     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only\n     seconds before.\n\n     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER\n\n     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless\n     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten\n     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating\n     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly\n     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.

Seven?...You got a hook on\n                   container 22?\n\n     A pause, then more voices.\n\n                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO\n                                (redneck drawl)\n                   The man's asking if you're hooked\n                   on 22, you dumb shit.\n\n                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO\n                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,\n                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,\n                   over.\n\n     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an\n     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal\n     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and\n     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front\n     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights\n     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE\n     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.\n\n                                WILLIE'S VOICE\n                                (woman's voice)\n                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.\n\n     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM\n\n     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion\n     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at\n     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,\n     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-\n     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.\n     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his\n     way.\n\n                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO\n                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container\n                   and call it a day.\n\n     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with\n     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a\n     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and\n     throws a console switch which activates another monitor\n     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside\n     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is\n     moving.\n\n     UNDERWATER\n\n     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED\n     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,\n     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.\n\n     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes\n     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is\n     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on\n     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool\n     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she\n     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from\n     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into\n     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.\n\n                                SIXPACK'S VOICE\n                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a\n                   tit or something?  We're all\n                   waiting on you, honey.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (under control)\n                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.\n                   I promise you'll be inside before\n                   \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\" comes on.\n\n     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They\n     like Willie and cheer her on.  \"Tell him, Willie,\" \"Atta\n     girl,\" etc...\n\n     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she\n     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what\n     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER\n     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the\n     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in\n     by a winch.\n\n                                WILLIE'S VOICE\n                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready\n                   to winch.\n\n     UNDERWATER MACHINERY\n\n     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and\n     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding\n     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.\n     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with\n     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.\n\n                                BECK/ RADIO\n                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.\n\n     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights\n     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:\n     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.\n\n     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will\n     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human\n     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the\n     building; stickers and signs:  \"No Bozos,\" etc.  A formal sign\n     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.\n\n     ON ONE OF THE CREW\n\n     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his\n     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the\n     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA\n     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.\n\n     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical\n     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick\n     movement, snares it.\n\n     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the\n     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE\n     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on\n     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has\n     noticed then continues on toward the shack.\n\n     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)\n\n     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,\n     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an\n     exaggerated accent.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   When it's time to relax....\n                   One thing stands clear...\n\n     INSIDE ON BECK\n\n     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see\n     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated\n     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He\n     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.\n\n                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)\n                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to\n                   hurry through...\n\n     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair\n     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs\n     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this\n     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously\n     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand\n     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS\n     OUT.\n\n     DEJESUS' POV\n\n     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring\n     vital signs.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   ...beer after beer...\n\n     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom\n     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze\n     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.\n\n                                DEJESUS(cont'd)\n                   Oh, shit...\n\n                                JONES/ RADIO\n                                (to DeJesus)\n                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                                (rising terror)\n                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...\n                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!\n                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...\n\n     INSIDE\n\n     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but\n     there is a definite tremble in his voice.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.\n\n                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)\n                                (gripped with panic)\n                   Ahhhh!\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.\n\n                                BECK (ON RADIO)\n                   DeJesus!

We see the same\n     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater\n     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside\n     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.\n\n     ON BECK\n\n     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.\n     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it\n     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by\n     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!\n     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.\n\n     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK\n\n     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the\n     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.\n\n     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then\n     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!\n\n     THE MESS - LATER\n\n     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess\n     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  \"DAYS TILL\n     PICKUP\".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board\n     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a \"3\"...\n\n     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE\n     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft\n     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he\n     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,\n     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a\n     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she\n     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,\n     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.\n     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still\n     shaken from his experience.\n\n     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the\n     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.\n\n                                BOWMAN\n                   I'm telling you, it's the suits!\n\n                                JONES\n                   Fuck the suits, it's the people\n                   monitoring them.

He savors it.\n\n     THE SWAMP - LATER\n\n     The \"Swamp\" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy\n     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and\n     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is\n     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we\n     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.\n\n     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a\n     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,\n     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked\n     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the\n     control switch and hits the START button.\n\n     NNNNNNNNNN.

As it turns the corner toward us we see it\n     says:  DEJESUS.\n\n     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME\n\n     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting\n     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been\n     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.\n\n                                DOC\n                   I must have dozed off.\n\n     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad\n     Whiskey.

The bunks can be closed-off with a\n     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls\n     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an\n     otherwise sterile environment.\n\n     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary\n     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which\n     proclaims:  \"I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET.\"\n     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's\n     has clipped pages from \"Gourmet\" of meals she dreams for;\n     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he\n     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an\n     indoor basketball goal.\n\n     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a\n     sponge and pail.

Overhead a huge\n     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization\n     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire\n     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.\n\n     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the\n     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark\n     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is\n     much louder and sinister.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Listen to it for Christsake.\n\n                                COBB\n                   Ah, it's just old, like me.\n                   You don't see the Doc opening\n                   me up every time I get a new creak\n                   in my joints...I say, as long as\n                   it's recycling the air let\n                   the next shift deal with it.\n                   But, 'long as we're here...\n\n     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops\n     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs\n     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones\n     seems in no hurry to accompany him.\n\n                                COBB(cont'd)\n                   You gonna sit there on your\n                   butt or give me a hand?\n\n     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.\n\n     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME\n\n     Beck in his quarters.

With\n     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces\n     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and\n     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds\n     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.\n\n     THE BILGE - SAME\n\n     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.\n     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans\n     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming\n     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy\n     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.\n\n                                COBB\n                   Okay, watch this..\n\n     THE SWAMP - SAME\n\n     The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound\n     in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops\n     directly in front of Willie.

Ignoring Beck she\n     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings\n     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS\n     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the\n     skewered sea spider out of the water.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (to Beck)\n                   A little problem, sir...but I've\n                   got a handle on it now.\n\n                                           TIME CUT TO:\n\n     THE MESS - LATER\n\n     BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches\n     stock prices scroll across the screen.

Discreetly he\n     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off\n     the table out of sight.\n\n     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the\n     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught\n     by DeJesus.

Cobb follows\n     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.\n\n     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus\n     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat\n     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts\n     the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka.\n\n     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Something wrong?\n\n     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,\n     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives\n     him a thumbs up.\n\n     MESS - LATER\n\n     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and\n     looks at it questioningly.

Suddenly\n     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks\n     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The\n     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim\n     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.\n\n     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.

Don't\n                   worry.\n\n     WASHROOM - SAME\n\n     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of\n     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a\n     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.\n\n     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.\n\n                                WILLIE(cont'd)\n                   Bo?...You okay?\n\n     INFIRMARY - SAME\n\n     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is\n     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table\n     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick\n     Room.\n\n     SICK ROOK - SAME\n\n     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The\n     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim\n     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the\n     body totally.  Jones smiles.\n\n                                JONES\n                                (whispers)\n                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...\n                   How you feeling?\n\n     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Hey, man, we made quota to-\n                   day.  No thanks to you, you\n                   dog, but we made it...Beck\n                   helped us...We just dropped\n                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've\n                   got ain't catching...\n\n     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack\n     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly\n     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.\n\n                                JONES(cont'd)\n                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back\n                   to sleep.\n\n     INFIRMARY - SAME\n\n     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now\n     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Who were you talking to?\n\n                                JONES\n                   Sixpack...\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   How is he?\n\n                                JONES\n                   Sleeping.  No sign of Doc,\n                   though.  I'll check the\n                   control room.  You look\n                   in the shower room...\n\n     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head\n     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the\n     door to the sick room behind Bowman.\n\n     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully\n     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to\n     throw up.\n\n     CLOSE ON BOWMAN\n\n     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the\n     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings\n     her hands in front of her face.\n\n     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her\n     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.\n\n                                BOWMAN\n                   Oh, God...what's going on?\n\n     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly\n     she goes to the door and enters.\n\n     SICK ROOM\n\n     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.\n\n                                BOWMAN\n                                (panicked)\n                   Sixpack...what's going on?\n\n     No answer.

He opens the door and freezes.\n\n     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is\n     empty.  The room deserted.\n\n                                JONES\n                                (pointing to\n                                examination table)\n                   I left her here.\n\n     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING\n     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and\n     moves slowly toward the noise.\n\n     SHOWER ROOM\n\n     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF\n     WATER.\n\n                                DOC\n                   Bowman?\n\n     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.\n\n                                DOC\n                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here\n                   to help you.\n\n     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc\n     opens the shower door.\n\n     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and\n     blood swirls down the drain.\n\n     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him\n     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen\n     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,\n     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE\n     SEE the black scales.\n\n     INFIRMARY\n\n     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the\n     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room\n     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers\n     Bowman with a sheet as\n\n                                                      WE CUT TO\n\n     THE MESS - LATER\n\n     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.\n     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.\n\n                                BECK\n                   I can't tell you much about\n                   it, except that none of you\n                   show any symptoms.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   And it killed Bo?\n\n                                BECK\n                   No...she killed herself.\n\n     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.\n\n                                JONES\n                   We're getting out of here just\n                   in time.\n\n                                BECK\n                   There's now a problem with the\n                   weather for pickup.

A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks\n     at Jones.\n\n                                BECK\n                                (motions for Jones\n                                to come with him)\n                   Jones...\n                                (to the others)\n                   Stay here.\n\n     RING CORRIDOR\n\n     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the\n     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once\n     more.  THUMP!\n\n     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the\n     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and\n     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes\n     suddenly widen.\n\n     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous\n     conglomeration on the the table.\n\n                                                  SLAM CUT TO\n\n     CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER\n\n     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the\n     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.\n\n     INT. CORRIDOR \"B\" - LATER\n\n     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,\n     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the\n     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the\n     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to\n     transport.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...\n\n                                COBB\n                                (angrily)\n                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's\n                   Jones!..\n\n     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Shut up, all of you.\n\n                                COBB\n                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that\n                   no body can be disposed of without\n                   authorization of---\n\n                                JONES\n                   Fuck the contract, man!\n\n     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by\n     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side\n     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the \"package.\"  Like\n     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The\n     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even\n     harder for everyone to get a handhold.\n\n                                BECK(cont'd)\n                   C'mon...Lift!\n\n     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to\n     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   Hey!...I feel something.\n                   It's moving!

Stop!\n\n     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.\n     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK\n     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a\n     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,\n     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.\n\n     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off\n     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a\n     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a\n     dagger.\n\n                                COBB\n                   It bit me!  It bit me!\n\n     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,\n     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.\n\n     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag\n     into the Lift Lock.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Push Hazy!\n\n     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its\n     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just\n     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS\n     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her\n     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't\n                   never gonna sleep again!\n\n     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks\n     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated\n     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the\n     Creature with the whirring blade.\n\n                                BECK\n                   No!\n\n                                COBB\n                   It bit me!\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   It's Sixpack!\n\n                                COBB\n                   I'm going to kill it!\n\n     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to\n     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly\n     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing\n     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Close the Lock!  Now!\n\n     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!\n\n     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!\n\n                                BECK(cont'd)\n                   Hit it again!\n\n     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.\n\n     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying\n     SCREAM rises from the Lock.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK\n\n     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,\n     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.\n\n                                BECK(cont'd)\n                   Flush it!\n\n     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown\n     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the\n     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory\n     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the\n     workbench.\n\n     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,\n     bloodstained.\n\n     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The\n     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the\n     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it\n     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of\n     the Shack lights...into the darkness.\n\n     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,\n     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in\n     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together\n     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus\n     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs\n     quietly.\n\n     SHOWERS - LATER\n\n     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is\n     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the\n     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her\n     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her\n     head against the wall of the shower stall.\n\n     DORMITORY - SAME\n\n     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.\n     After some digging which produces five month's supply of\n     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck\n     picks it up.\n\n                                BECK\n                   I think we just found our\n                   problem.\n\n     MESS - LATER\n\n     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,\n     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for\n     a run.

Think about that.\n                   Sixty-four square miles.\n\n     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits\n     it into place as Jones watches.

Beck steps into the equipment room.\n\n     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.\n     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the\n     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw\n     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband\n     floating in the bilgewater.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Willie...\n\n     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Yeah?\n\n     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he\n     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie\n     drops from the bar laughing.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (grinning)\n                   What on earth's the matter\n                   with you?\n\n                                JONES\n                   I ought to smack your face!\n\n     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   What's wrong?\n\n                                JONES\n                   DeJesus...It's got him.\n\n     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME\n\n     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable\n     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits\n     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it\n     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.\n\n     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated\n     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at\n     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle\n     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.\n\n                                BECK\n                   I thought they were your friends?\n\n                                JONES\n                   Were, Doss were.\n\n     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from\n     him.\n\n                                BECK\n                   You fire that in here and\n                   you'll bring the whole place\n                   down.\n\n     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of\n     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long\n     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.\n     Jones grins.\n\n     INFIRMARY - SAME\n\n     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his\n     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer\n     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the\n     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.\n\n     INT.

WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the\n     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the\n     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been\n     drained.\n\n     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME\n\n     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie\n     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.\n     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only\n     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he\n     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which\n     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where\n     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE CABINET\n\n     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and\n     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire\n     system has been disabled.\n\n     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY\n     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping\n     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns\n     directly into\n\n     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,\n     poised to strike.\n\n     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the\n     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes\n     in the corridor.\n\n     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is\n     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he\n     has seen the devil itself.\n\n                                COBB\n                   What happened?\n\n                                DOC\n                                (absently)\n                   It...almost got you.\n\n                                COBB\n                   What was it?\n\n     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.\n\n     THE MESS\n\n     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones\n     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He\n     listens.\n\n                                COBS\n                                (excitedly)\n                   I saw it!

Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his\n     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm\n     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his\n     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The\n     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the\n     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.

Jones!?\n\n     ON WILLIE\n\n     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet\n     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a\n     tail!\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Oh God...\n\n     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly\n     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,\n     trapping it vise-like in the door.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Run Willie!  Run!\n\n     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the\n     heavy door severs its appendage.\n\n     ON BECK AND JONES\n\n     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them\n     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls\n     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Well done.  Just like\n                   momma makes 'em.\n\n     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the\n     creature are gone.\n\n     ON WILLIE RUNNING\n\n     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner\n     path toward Corridor \"A\".  In a full run now, every panel\n     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc\n     CREATURE?---\n\n     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE\n\n     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump\n     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows\n     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.\n\n     ON WILLIE\n\n     She turns down Corridor \"A\".  A NOISE overhead in the water\n     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM\n     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK\n     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her\n     between him and Beck in the shadows.\n\n                                BECK\n                                (whispered)\n                   Where's Cobb and Doc?\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (recovering)\n                   Cobb's cut...It was in him!\n                   It got Doc...\n\n                                JONES\n                   Oh man, that's just great...\n\n                                BECK\n                   C'mon.\n\n     CONTROL ROOM\n\n     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.

A red light blinks ominously on the console.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Shit!

Beck, Willie and Jones all\n     nervously exchange looks.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Well, at least we're safe inside\n                   here.\n\n                                JONES\n                   For how long?\n\n     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a\n     message.

What's\n     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the\n     water.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Jesus Christ...\n\n                                BECK\n                   Can you fix it?\n\n                                JONES\n                   No way...\n\n                                BECK\n                   Think!  Can we stop it?!\n                   Block it up?!  Shut down\n                   the line somewhere?!  Think!\n\n                                JONES\n                   I am thinking, man!  You\n                   think I want to die!  I am\n                   thinking!  I--\n\n     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his\n     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK\n     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage\n     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before\n     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a\n     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS\n     and disappears.\n\n     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes\n     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.\n\n                                JONES\n                   I hit it.  But I can't see\n                   it!  Can you see it?!\n\n                                BECK\n                                (standing)\n                   No.\n\n     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a\n     thought.\n\n                                JONES\n                   The Swamp.  There's an over-\n                   ride switch in the Swamp.\n\n     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the\n     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'\n     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised\n     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's\n     thigh.\n\n                                JONES\n                                (screams)\n                   Ahhh!\n\n     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the\n     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the\n     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the\n     ladder.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Hurry...Get out!\n\n     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor\n     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then\n     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the\n     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is\n     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE\n     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.\n\n     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and\n     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward\n     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge\n     when a voice from above distracts it.\n\n                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)\n                   Hey, you?\n\n     The Creature looks up and sees:\n\n     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER\n     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE\n     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.\n\n     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives\n     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the\n     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken\n     power cable from the wall.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Jones!  Get your feet out\n                   of the water!\n\n     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck\n     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's\n     feet.\n\n     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY\n\n     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it\n     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the\n     water.\n\n     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs\n     out, followed by Beck.\n\n     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE\n     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.\n\n                                BECK\n                   C'mon, the Swamp!\n\n     They start for the Swamp down Corridor \"A\" when an enormous\n     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink\n     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him\n     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just\n     above the water stops him from falling back in.\n\n     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Beck!\n\n     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt\n     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of\n     the collapsing Shack.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Go on!\n\n                                JONES\n                   No!\n\n                                BECK\n                   That's an order!\n\n                                JONES\n                   Fuck your orders!\n\n     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts\n     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,\n     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one\n     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together\n     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit\n     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor \"A\"\n     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!\n\n     AS THEY RUN\n\n     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  \"Five\n     minutes until implosion...\"\n\n     FLASH CUTS OF:\n\n     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING\n     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING\n     THREE CREW MEMBERS\n\n     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...\n\n     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...\n\n     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE\n     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!\n     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the\n     firm ground.\n\n     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND\n     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.\n\n     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn\n     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR\n     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.\n\n     BECK ARRIVES\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   It's jammed!\n\n     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand\n     held spreader--like a \"Jaws of Life\"--from the wall.  He\n     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY\n     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS\n     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.\n\n     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks\n     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its\n     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash\n     of its razor sharp teeth.\n\n     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the\n     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a\n     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his\n     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh\n     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a\n     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage\n     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the\n     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.\n\n     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where\n     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door\n     open.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Where the hell've you been?\n\n                                BECK\n                   I got hung up!  Try this!\n\n     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the\n     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'\n     help the two men force open the door and all three rush\n     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.\n\n     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  \"Five minutes to\n     implosion.\"  And we feel it happening:\n\n     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE\n     VIBRATIONS\n\n     THE WALLS SHAKE\n\n     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.\n     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER\n\n     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red\n     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half\n     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.\n\n                                JONES\n                   It won't go!\n\n     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not\n     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!\n\n     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!\n\n     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!\n\n     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  \"Four minutes...\"\n\n     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK\n\n     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her\n     suit hangs.\n\n                                BECK\n                   The suits!

Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around\n     the perimeter of her helmet.\n\n     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS...\"Three\n     minutes...to...implosion...\"\n\n     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the\n     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to\n     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and\n     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.\n\n     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the\n     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track\n     to the Lock.\n\n                                JONES\n                   Your suit, Becky!\n\n                                BECK\n                   Just get in yours!\n\n     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his\n     suit.\n\n     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving\n     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner\n     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.\n\n     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves\n     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM\n     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE\n     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.\n\n     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off\n     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (screams)\n                   Look out!\n\n     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and\n     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to\n     see Jones seal himself into his suit.\n\n                                JONES/RADIO\n                   I'm in.\n\n                                BECK\n                                (to the others)\n                   Go!\n\n                                WILLIE/RADIO\n                   No!\n\n     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK\n\n     Beck looks at the others one last time.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Go, now!  That's an order!\n\n     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the\n     elevator sends them down without Beck.\n\n     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he\n     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the\n     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck\n     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head\n     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!\n\n     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips\n     tremble in agony.\n\n                                DEJESUS\n                   Kill me...Kill me!\n\n     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with\n     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.\n\n     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock\n     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it\n     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the\n     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!\n\n     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  \"One minute to\n     implosion...\"\n\n     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.\n     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy\n     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the\n     generator.\n\n     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter\n     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature\n     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck\n     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his\n     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking\n     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the\n     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!\n\n                                BECK\n                   No!\n\n     He hits again, still nothing!\n\n     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE...\"Nineteen, eighteen...\"  Her\n     voice begins to quiver.\n\n     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE\n     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND\n     BECK'S LEG!\n\n     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time\n     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!\n\n     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK\n     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH\n     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!\n\n     UNDERWATER - LATER\n\n     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward\n     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.\n     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A\n     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the\n     darkness after the first.\n\n     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his\n     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as\n     he moves closer to the surface.\n\n     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her\n     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then\n     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At\n     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then\n     we see it again--a glimmer of light.\n\n                                WILLIE(RADIO)\n                   Light.  Beck, I see light!\n\n     ON BECK\n\n     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as\n     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click\n     off...\"125, 100, 75...\"\n\n                                BECK(RADIO)\n                   Wait till you reach thirty-\n                   five before you blow your suit...\n\n                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)\n                   Roger.\n\n     WILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down \"....70, 60, 50, 40...\"\n\n                                WILLIE(RADIO)\n                   Ejecting.\n\n     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The\n     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her\n     hand gropes for it.\n\n     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES\n     UPWARD.\n\n     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as\n     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.\n\n     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie\n     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.\n\n     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE\n     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE\n     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.\n\n     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull\n     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE\n     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   We made it!\n\n                                BECK\n                   Where's Jones?\n\n     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At\n     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck\n     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach\n     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water\n     and inflates his life jacket.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Is he okay?\n\n     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a\n     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint\n     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he\n     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the \"thumbs-up.\"\n\n                                WILLIE(cont'd)\n                                (jubilant)\n                   The sun!

I saw a ship.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Well, why haven't they answered\n                   our flares?\n\n                                BECK\n                   We'll fire one more, that\n                   leaves us one last one.\n\n     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it\n     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark\n     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   Are you okay, Jonesy?\n\n                                JONES\n                                (weakly)\n                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (testing him)\n                   Who's the best power forward\n                   in the NBA...Jameson?\n\n                                JONES\n                                (tired, but\n                                with fight)\n                   Jameson?  Who are you trying\n                   to con...?\n\n     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.\n\n                                BECK\n                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!\n\n     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just\n     fading against the sky.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   It saw us!\n\n                                JONES\n                   Answer them and quit kicking me!\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   I'm not touching you!\n\n     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the\n     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the\n     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   No...no, no, no.\n\n     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.\n\n     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME\n\n     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and\n     speaks to someone O.S.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                   I thought you said you'd\n                   combed this area?\n\n     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN\n     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and\n     smiles coolly as he lies.\n\n                                MARTIN\n                   We did....Many times.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                                (looks at Martin\n                                then to a Lieutenant)\n                   Initiate rescue.\n\n     We hold on Martin's face as from\n\n     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP\n\n     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks\n     off toward the fading flare.\n\n     OCEAN - SAME\n\n     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.\n     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                                (panicky)\n                   It hit me!  Where are they?!\n\n                                BECK\n                   I can't see them!\n\n     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two\n     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to\n     taunt the sharks aggressively.\n\n                                JONES\n                   All right!  I've had enough\n                   of this shit!  You want meat,\n                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat\n                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!\n\n     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop\n     him.\n\n                                JONES(cont'd)\n                                (taunting sharks)\n                   What's wrong you snout-nosed\n                   bastards?  My meat too tough\n                   for you?!\n\n     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck\n     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.\n\n                                JONES(cont'd)\n                                (to Willie and Beck)\n                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools\n                   run?  They know whose boss.\n\n     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE\n     SEE a gash across his forearm.\n\n     UNDERWATER POV\n\n     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT\n     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!\n\n     SURFACE/OCEAN\n\n     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something\n     is happening...\n\n     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,\n     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over\n     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave\n     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!\n\n     UNDERWATER\n\n     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and\n     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!\n\n     THE HELICOPTER\n\n     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its\n     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR\n     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the\n     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock\n     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and\n     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.\n     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!\n\n     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the\n     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water\n     where\n\n     BECK grabs the harness.\n\n                                BECK\n                   C'mon, Jones!\n\n     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN\n     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE\n     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND\n     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR\n     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Jonesy, No!\n\n                                JONES\n                   Get out of here, Becky!\n\n     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.\n     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he\n     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a\n     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles\n     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs\n     to the surface several feet away from Beck.\n\n     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!\n     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life\n     vest as the Creature starts for him.\n\n     ON HELICOPTER\n\n     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the\n     Creature bears down on Beck.\n\n                                WINCH OPERATOR\n                   Is he in the harness!\n\n     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers\n     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'\n     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!\n\n     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles\n     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body\n     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.\n\n                                BECK\n                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!\n\n     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck\n     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly\n     pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue\n     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!\n\n     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the\n     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him\n     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the\n     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean\n     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off\n     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.\n     The winch operator pulls him in.\n\n     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER\n\n     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of\n     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked\n     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and\n     shakes his hand.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                   Mr. Beck, I understand\n                   you passed your physical with\n                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?\n\n                                BECK\n                                (worried)\n                   I don't know yet, she's still\n                   in there.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                   Well, you'll be glad to know\n                   you have a friend onboard.\n\n     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.\n\n                                MARTIN\n                                (excitedly)\n                   Beck!  I told them you'd\n                   make it.  No one back at\n                   TransOcean believed me, but\n                   I never gave up on you once.\n                                (smiling)\n                   So, how are you feeling?\n\n     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in\n     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across\n     the deck.\n\n                                BECK\n                   Better...A lot better.\n\n     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears\n     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   I'm fine!\n\n     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD\n     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING\n     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.\n     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The\n     Captain notices.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                   I thought we might have some\n                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's\n                   something else you'd rather have...\n\n     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at\n     the Captain and smiles.\n\n                                WILLIE\n                   How about a burger and fries?\n\n     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the\n     deck with the Captain.\n\n     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the\n     distance and WE ARE AT THE\n\n     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN\n\n     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping\n     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold\n     depths.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                THE END\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeviathan\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Peoples\u00a0\u00a0Jeb Stuart\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:29:19.938039"}
