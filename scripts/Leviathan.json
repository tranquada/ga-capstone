I ain't the hook,\n                   over.\n\n     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an\n     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal\n     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and\n     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front\n     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights\n     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE\n     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.\n\n<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE\n</b>                                (woman's voice)\n                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.\n\n<b>     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM\n</b>\n     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion\n     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at\n     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,\n     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-\n     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.\n     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his\n     way.\n\n<b>                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO\n</b>                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container\n                   and call it a day.\n\n     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with\n     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a\n     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and\n     throws a console switch which activates another monitor\n     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside\n     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is\n     moving.\n\n<b>     UNDERWATER\n</b>\n     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED\n     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,\n     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.\n\n     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes\n     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is\n     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on\n     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool\n     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she\n     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from\n     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into\n     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.\n\n<b>                                SIXPACK'S VOICE\n</b>                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a\n                   tit or something?  We're all\n                   waiting on you, honey.\n\n<b>                                WILLIE\n</b>                                (under control)\n                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.\n                   I promise you'll be inside before\n                   \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\" comes on.\n\n     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They\n     like Willie and cheer her on.  \"Tell him, Willie,\" \"Atta\n     girl,\" etc...\n\n     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she\n     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what\n     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER\n     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the\n     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in\n     by a winch.\n\n<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE\n</b>                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready\n                   to winch.\n\n<b>     UNDERWATER MACHINERY\n</b>\n     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and\n     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding\n     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.\n     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with\n     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.\n\n<b>                                BECK/ RADIO\n</b>                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.\n\n     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights\n     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:\n<b>     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.\n</b>\n     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will\n     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human\n     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the\n     building; stickers and signs:  \"No Bozos,\" etc.  A formal sign\n     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.\n\n<b>     ON ONE OF THE CREW\n</b>\n     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his\n     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the\n     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA\n     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.\n\n     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical\n     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick\n     movement, snares it.\n\n     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the\n     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE\n     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on\n     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has\n     noticed then continues on toward the shack.\n\n<b>     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)\n</b>\n     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,\n     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an\n     exaggerated accent.\n\n<b>                                DEJESUS\n</b>                   When it's time to relax....\n                   One thing stands clear...\n\n<b>     INSIDE ON BECK\n</b>\n     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see\n     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated\n     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He\n     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.\n\n<b>                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)\n</b>                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to\n                   hurry through...\n\n     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair\n     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs\n     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this\n     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously\n     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand\n     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS\n     <u>OUT</u>.\n\n<b>     DEJESUS' POV\n</b>\n     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring\n     vital signs.\n\n<b>                                DEJESUS\n</b>                   ...beer after beer...\n\n     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom\n     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze\n     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.\n\n                                DEJESUS(cont'd)\n                   Oh, shit...\n\n<b>                                JONES/ RADIO\n</b>                                (to DeJesus)\n                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.\n\n<b>                                DEJESUS\n</b>                                (rising terror)\n                   Jonesy!

Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side\n     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the \"package.\"  Like\n     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The\n     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even\n     harder for everyone to get a handhold.\n\n                                BECK(cont'd)\n                   C'mon...Lift!\n\n     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to\n     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.\n\n<b>                                DEJESUS\n</b>                   Hey!...I feel something.\n                   It's moving!

It beats wildly for several second,\n     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.\n\n     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off\n     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a\n     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a\n     dagger.\n\n<b>                                COBB\n</b>                   It bit me!

Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just\n     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS\n     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her\n     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.\n\n<b>                                JONES\n</b>                   Oh, Jesus Christ!

Beck looks\n     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated\n     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the\n     Creature with the whirring blade.\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   No!\n\n<b>                                COBB\n</b>                   It bit me!\n\n<b>                                DEJESUS\n</b>                   It's Sixpack!\n\n<b>                                COBB\n</b>                   I'm going to kill it!\n\n     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to\n     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly\n     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing\n     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   Close the Lock!  Now!\n\n     Doc hits the lever.

The\n     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the\n     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it\n     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of\n     the Shack lights...into the darkness.\n\n     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,\n     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in\n     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together\n     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus\n     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs\n     quietly.\n\n<b>     SHOWERS - LATER\n</b>\n     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is\n     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the\n     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her\n     skin.

Turning it\n     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.\n\n     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated\n     container transporters.

Cobb turns\n     directly into\n\n     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,\n     poised to strike.\n\n     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the\n     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes\n     in the corridor.\n\n     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is\n     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he\n     has seen the devil itself.\n\n<b>                                COBB\n</b>                   What happened?\n\n<b>                                DOC\n</b>                                (absently)\n                   It...almost got you.\n\n<b>                                COBB\n</b>                   What was it?\n\n     Doc shakes his head dumbly.

Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The\n     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the\n     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.

In his\n     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK\n     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage\n     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before\n     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a\n     blast of flame from his flamethrower.

Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is\n     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE\n     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.\n\n     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and\n     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward\n     directly under the hole in the floor.

They have to go around the other way!\n\n<b>     AS THEY RUN\n</b>\n     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  \"Five\n     minutes until implosion...\"\n\n<b>     FLASH CUTS OF:\n</b>\n<b>     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING\n</b><b>     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING\n</b><b>     THREE CREW MEMBERS\n</b>\n<b>     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...\n</b>\n<b>     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...\n</b>\n<b>     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE\n</b><b>     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!\n</b>     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the\n     firm ground.\n\n<b>     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND\n</b><b>     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.\n</b>\n     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn\n     into the Swamp Annex.

IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.\n</b>\n     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks\n     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its\n     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash\n     of its razor sharp teeth.\n\n     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the\n     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a\n     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his\n     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh\n     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a\n     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage\n     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the\n     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.\n\n     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where\n     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door\n     open.\n\n<b>                                JONES\n</b>                   Where the hell've you been?\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   I got hung up!

He takes the tool from Beck and\n     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.\n\n     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the\n     Lock.

Willie and Beck wave\n     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!\n\n<b>     UNDERWATER\n</b>\n     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and\n<b>     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!\n</b>\n<b>     THE HELICOPTER\n</b>\n     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its\n     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR\n     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the\n     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock\n     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and\n     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.\n     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!\n\n     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the\n     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water\n     where\n\n     BECK grabs the harness.\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   C'mon, Jones!\n\n     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN\n<b>     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE\n</b><b>     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND\n</b><b>     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR\n</b><b>     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.\n</b>\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   Jonesy, No!\n\n<b>                                JONES\n</b>                   Get out of here, Becky!\n\n     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.\n     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he\n     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a\n     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles\n     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs\n     to the surface several feet away from Beck.\n\n     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!\n     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life\n     vest as the Creature starts for him.\n\n<b>     ON HELICOPTER\n</b>\n     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the\n     Creature bears down on Beck.\n\n<b>                                WINCH OPERATOR\n</b>                   Is he in the harness!\n\n     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers\n     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'\n     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!\n\n     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles\n     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body\n     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.\n\n<b>                                BECK\n</b>                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!\n\n     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck\n     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and <u>is suddenly</u>\n     <u>pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!</u>  The rescue\n     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!\n\n     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the\n     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him\n     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the\n     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean\n     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off\n     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.\n     The winch operator pulls him in.\n\n<b>     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER\n</b>\n     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of\n     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked\n     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and\n     shakes his hand.\n\n<b>                                CAPTAIN\n</b>                   Mr. Beck, I understand\n                   you passed your physical with\n                   flying colors.
