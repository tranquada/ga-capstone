ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1\n\n    ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes\n    small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth\n    playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights.\n\n    On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a\n    tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise\n    in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods\n    of the   foothills.\n\n\n2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2\n\n    Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and\n    parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out\n    a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.\n\n\n3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3\n\n    Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor\n    collides with the debris of a recent party.\n\n    She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and\n    house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses.\n\n    Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding\n    glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool.\n\n    A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water\n    onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer.\n\n    He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the\n    vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.\n\n\n4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4\n\n    The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE\n    LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.\n\n                          OWNER\n                I've got the five stores here and\n                then two in Rio Rancho.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                    GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       2.\n4   CONTINUED:                                                        4\n\n\n                           JOE\n                 That's fantastic. See, if we're\n                 talking that kind of volume I can\n                 absolutely massage the numbers a\n                 little. Seriously, you're not gonna\n                 be able to keep it on the shelf.\n\n    Joe pulls out some order forms.\n\n                           OWNER\n                 Yeah, I'd need to look at some\n                 things before I can place an order.\n\n    The owner looks at Joe's business card.\n\n                           OWNER\n                 How about I give you a call if I\n                 decide to--\n\n                           JOE\n                 I'll call you. Not a problem. No\n                 problem at all. Even better, I'll\n                 swing by. You're on my route. How\n                 `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.\n\n                           OWNER\n                 Yeah, tomorrow's not good.\n\n                           JOE\n                 Thursday then. That's better\n                 anyway. That'll give you a chance\n                 to take a look see on those other\n                 stores. We'll put everything on one\n                 order and get you a good price\n                 break.\n\n    The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.\n\n                           JOE\n                 My advice to you - weed out some of\n                 this weaker product to make more\n                 space for the corn. Like this...\n\n    Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.\n\n                           JOE\n                 Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright\n                 idea was it to stock that? I mean\n                 come on, what self respecting kid\n                 asks his mom for apricot fruit\n                 leather?\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                  GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     2A.\n4   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  4\n\n\n    The owner is not amused.\n\n\n5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5\n\n    Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters\n    to his rusted Monte Carlo.\n\n\n6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6\n\n    Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH\n    LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with\n    MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the\n    exchange with amusement.\n\n    Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits\n    the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and\n    joins the fray.\n\n                        MR. KIM\n              You are fired.\n\n                        NORAH\n              I so don't care.\n\n    Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she\n    continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might\n    not have been the best decision ever.\n\n                        NORAH\n              Fuck.\n\n                                    GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        3.\n\n\n\n\n7    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                          7\n\n     A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and\n     kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down\n     the drain. Gone.\n\n     Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill\n     onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out.\n\n\n8    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                           8\n\n     Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the\n     empty hall.\n\n\n9    INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9\n\n     A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove\n     compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath\n     freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.\n\n\n10   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY                                  10\n\n     The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a\n     shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his\n     attention to another customer.\n\n     The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the\n     shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin.\n\n     A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the\n     businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to\n     horrible anticipation. He braces for the...\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n11   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER                                11\n\n     Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish\n     man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt,\n     talks to the STORE OWNER.\n\n                         CARL\n               Yep, these shotgun cases are a real\n               pain in the ass.

ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                              12\n\n     Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp\n     features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her\n     confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life\n     peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad.\n\n\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                        GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     5.\n12   CONTINUED:                                                        12\n\n\n     A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong.\n     You are powerful.

LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       13\n\n     Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged\n     pop-can-pipe.\n\n                            NORAH\n                  The fact that we have sex, real\n                  coitus sex, means I'm under no\n                  obligation to blow you.\n\n     Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to\n     RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's.\n\n                            RANDY\n                  I think you're scared of it.\n\n     The phone RINGS.\n\n     Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing\n     the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one.\n\n                            NORAH\n                      (Holding in the smoke)\n                  I'm not scared of it.\n\n                            RANDY\n                  Uncomfortable then. You just need\n                  to get better acquainted.\n\n     Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The\n     phone RINGS again.\n\n                            NORAH\n                      (yelling)\n                  Dad, get the phone.\n\n                            RANDY\n                  There's absolutely no pressure\n                  here.\n\n\n\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                     GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     6.\n13   CONTINUED:                                                      13\n\n\n     Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah\n     ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers.\n     She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear.\n\n     The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks\n     up the receiver.\n\n                            RANDY\n                  You can touch it if you want.\n\n                            NORAH\n                      (into phone)\n                  Hello.\n\n                            ROSE (O.S.)\n                      (through receiver)\n                  You haven't left yet?

She takes the pencil from behind her\n     ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead\n     or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.\n\n\n14   INT.

They lift their T-\n     shirts up over their noses and walk inside.\n\n     Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean\n     like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates.\n\n     Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ.

She\n      bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge.\n\n      Rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of\n      the window in an attempt to break the seal.

She turns.\n\n      A weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and\n      tosses birdseed to the pigeons.\n\n                          NORAH\n                I'm standing here.\n\n      Norah looks back up to Rose still struggling with the window.\n      Finally, Rose muscles it open and throws Norah an angry look\n      of triumph.

She looks to be about\n     five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients\n     off a Twizzler package.\n\n                         JOE\n               Glycerol monostearate?

Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls\n     out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon.\n\n     Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school\n     photos. Each photo is of a different grade.

Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud\n     quick ring. They wait for something to happen.\n\n     An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another\n     quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the\n     ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises.\n\n     Norah takes out her sign language book.

The thirty or\n     so people listening to the SPEAKER appear to be mostly\n     hospital staff and EMT workers. A placard near the door\n     reads: SEMINAR FOR BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS.\n\n     CARL SWANSON leans forward from his chair and looks down the\n     row to Rose.\n\n                            SPEAKER\n                  OK.

But, they don't know what\n                  they're doing. No idea. They're not\n                  professional and that makes us all\n                  look bad.\n\n                            ROSE\n                  Well, we're not like that.

Norah turns to face Oscar.\n\n                            NORAH\n                  It just means your mom wasn't\n                  married when she had you. It's no\n                  big deal. In a couple of years\n                  you're gonna find it's a free pass\n                  to cool. You'll probably start a\n                  band called Bastard Son.

Rose's hand rests lightly on the\n     woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.\n\n\n90   INT.

BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - DAY                                   91\n\n     Norah enters the red splattered room. A walker lies on its\n     side next to a blood-soaked rug.

The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in\n     a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'.\n\n     Norah slips a Tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. A car\n     pull up to the curb. Norah stops and watches her sister walk\n     Mrs. Davis to the car before starting her work.\n\n\n92   INT.

LORKOWSKI HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1987 - DAY                    123\n\n      The sky is an electric blue. The kind that lives in memories\n      and dreams. Rose (10) and Norah (5) play in a parked car.\n\n      Rose pretends to drive and smoke a cigarette while Norah\n      makes faces in the rearview mirror.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                    GREEN REVISION 3/5/07    78A.\n123   CONTINUED:                                                    123\n\n\n      Rose gets out of the car and races toward the house. Norah\n      chases after.\n\n                             NORAH\n                   Rose, wait for me.\n\n                                    GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        79.\n\n\n\n\n124   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 1987 - DAY                  124\n\n      A giggling Rose stumbles in. She stops. The bathroom door is\n      open slightly. She walks over peeks through the opening.\n\n      There's a dress crumpled on the floor. A woman slumps\n      motionless in the tub. Her delicate hand hangs over the edge.\n      Scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain.\n\n      Norah enters the front door. She smiles, unburdened by the\n      knowledge. She runs towards Rose. Rose quickly pushes her\n      back and closes the door.\n\n      Norah senses something's wrong. She struggles to see what's\n      behind the door but Rose won't let go.\n\n\n125   EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT                                       125\n\n      The static mixes back into the roar of the train. The roar\n      grows distant and is replaced by Norah's laughter.\n\n      Still laughing, Norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on\n      a beam next to her. The beer falls. Norah tries to catch it,\n      loses her balance and falls with a thud.\n\n      Lynn catches her breath.\n\n                             LYNN\n                Oh, shit.\n\n      Lynn runs over to find Norah on her back, eyes closed.

ROSE'S HOUSE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT                              126\n\n      Oscar walks down the sidewalk alone.

ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           127\n\n      Rose stands in her T-shirt and undies. Mac shuts the door.\n      Rose leans her head against the door and exhales deeply. She\n      turns as if something is calling her.\n\n\n128   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               128\n\n      Rose stands on tip toes and feels around on top of the\n      refrigerator until she finds what she's looking for...\n      emergency cigarettes.\n\n\n129   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           129\n\n      Rose sits down on the couch and lights her cigarette. The\n      nicotine patch is still clearly visible on her arm.\n\n      Rose looks at the stack of unopened mail. Something grabs her\n      attention. An envelope bearing the return address of Paula\n      Datzman-Mead. Rose rips opens the envelope.\n\n      Rose stares at an invitation to Paula's baby shower. A smile\n      creeps across her face.\n\n      The front door opens and Oscar walks in.\n\n\n\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                      GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        81.\n129   CONTINUED:                                                         129\n\n\n                              ROSE\n                   Oscar?\n\n      Brow furrowed, he walks past Rose without acknowledging her.\n      He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.\n\n\n130   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT \u00ad LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                       130\n\n      A bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty\n      Styrofoam cups.\n\n                             LYNN\n                   How's the hand?\n\n      Norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts\n      gnawing on the side.

Everything is still and tense.\n\n                              LYNN\n                   Better?\n\n      Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks\n      up to   Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester\n      kiss.   Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on\n      Lynn.   All is good.\n\n      Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed\n      enjoying the moment.\n\n      Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly\n      across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures.\n      Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes.\n\n      Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.\n\n                              LYNN\n                   Is that?\n\n      Lynn pulls away.\n\n                             LYNN\n                   Are those...\n\n\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                       GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        82.\n130   CONTINUED:                                                          130\n\n\n      Lynn tries to suss it out, shakes her head, looks at Norah.\n\n                             LYNN\n                   How do you have my school pictures?\n\n                             NORAH\n                   I just...

She investigates.\n\n      A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges\n      looks up with big startled eyes.

She coos\n      at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An\n      expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her.\n\n      Norah runs toward the house.\n\n\n147   INT.

The top is engraved with her initials.\n\n                             MAC\n                   It's for your business cards.

It seems to make her sad.\n\n                             MAC\n                   You don't like it?\n\n                             ROSE\n                   No, I like it very much.\n\n      Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.\n\n                             ROSE\n                   It's just this thing we're doing.\n\n                             MAC\n                   Come on, let's not do that.\n\n      But Rose is resolute.

Finally, he\n      nods and Rose watches him walk away.\n\n\n158   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES \u00ad ONE WEEK LATER - DAY            158\n\n      Norah steps off the elevator.

Other equipment litters pavement around the van.\n\n      Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard.\n\n                          WINSTON\n                I'm sure I can turn this stuff\n                around pretty quick.\n\n                          ROSE\n                Thanks.

Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular\n      case. He beams with anticipation.\n\n      Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair\n      of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.\n\n                          JOE\n                That other pair we looked at, full\n                of gadgets and gimmicks.\n                          (MORE)\n\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                       GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       103.\n162   CONTINUED:                                                          162\n                             JOE (cont'd)\n                   They just didn't have the heft you\n                   want in a pair of lenses.

But still.\n\n                             ROSE\n                   Dad, you promised him those others.\n                   From the store.

She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans\n      past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.\n\n                             NORAH\n                   I read somewhere that beauty is\n                   really all about symmetry.

More defensive than sincere. Just\n      the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.\n\n                             ROSE\n                   God, that drives me crazy!

Like that's a\n                   legitimate excuse.\n\n      Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards\n      Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.\n\n                             NORAH\n                   I really am sorry.
