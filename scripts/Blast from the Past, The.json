Calvin\n                 spends all his time tinkering out\n                 there in his workshop.

Calvin, sounding like a deep sea\n       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to\n       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his\n       flashlight.

He\n       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)\n       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic\n       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH\n       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and\n       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.\n\n<b>       EXT.

In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-\n       plated word \"Toyota.\"   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search\n       through the garbage.

Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the\n       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY\n       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom\n       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at\n       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the\n       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger\n       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol\n       is really a water gun.\n\n<b>       INT.

SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER\n</b>\n       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard\n       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great\n       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in\n       the corner.\n\n<b>                           CALVIN\n</b>                 I'm going to give it to you straight.\n                 There's no point in beating around the\n                 bush.

That's where I was\n                 born. We\n                 only survived because it was a huge\n                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My\n                 father worked on it secretly for\n                 years. When he had to, he used\n                 contractors, but always from out-of-\n                 state and always for just a portion of\n                 the job. He told them it was a secret\n                 government experiment done through\n                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he\n                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of\n                 course, it had to be a secret, because\n                 we had just enough supplies to last\n                 three people thirty-five years. That's\n                 also why I have no brothers or\n                 sisters. The air vent was the really\n                 tricky part, but he was able to cut\n                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd\n                 like to do Eve, is take you down into\n                 the fallout shelter with me. We could\n                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad\n                 said if I found a healthy girl I\n                 should \"bring her on down\".

And I was going to wait a while,\n                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.\n                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I\n                 looked it up in old newspapers.\n\n<b>                           CALVIN\n</b>                     (after a while)\n                 You're sure?\n\n<b>                           ADAM\n</b>                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed\n                 without a shot being fired.

First the parents take\n                 care of the children and then the\n                 children take care\n                 of the parents. He says historically,\n                 that's how it works.\n\n<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\n       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.

They're such\n                 wonderful dreams.\n\n       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass\n       doors.
