SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT\n\n       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the\n       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.\n       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.\n       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words \"THE\n       BLAST\" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT\n       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words \"FROM THE\n       PAST\" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily\n       shakes.\n\n       INT. JET\n\n       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his\n       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He\n       relaxes.\n\n       EXT. JET\n\n       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the\n       plane to move away. Then SUPER: \"LOS ANGELES, 1962\"\n       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording\n       from that period has been playing throughout.\n\n       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT\n\n       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and\n       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We\n       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's\n       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where\n       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work\n       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The\n       music becomes source.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got\n                 guests!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling\n                 with this darn rheostat.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Well, put it down and come in!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 You bet, hon!\n\n       They exit the workshop for the house.

COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME\n\n       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on\n       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that\n       hangs loosely from his helmet.\n\n                           PILOT\n                 Tower. Wolf One.

DINING ROOM\n\n       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet\n       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.\n\n                           BETTY\n                 Just remember: don't mention the\n                 communists!\n\n                           DAVE\n                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a\n                 little, you know...\n\n                           BETTY\n                 Nutty.\n\n                           RUTH\n                 What's his wife like?\n\n                           BETTY\n                 Oh, you know, housewife.\n\n                           DAVE\n                 Likes to cook.

She\n       favors June Allison.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!\n\n                           BETTY\n                 Just look at you!\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Any day now!\n\n                           BETTY\n                 This is my sister and her husband.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Oh, hi! Welcome!\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make\n       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a\n       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,\n                 \"I'd like to buy this lip balm.\"  And\n                 the clerk says, \"Will that be cash or\n                 a check?\"  And the duck says, \"Just\n                 put it on my bill!\"\n\n       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's\n       sight-line rolls his eyes.\n\n       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB\n\n       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-\n       serving everyone.\n\n                           DAVE\n                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal\n                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing\n                 things.\n\n                           BOB\n                 What kind of things?\n\n                           DAVE\n                 You got me.  Some kind of special\n                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of\n                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly\n                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits\n                 teaching.\n\n       ANGLE - CALVIN\n\n       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 How's that?\n\n                           GUEST\n                 Just what the doctor ordered!\n\n       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.\n\n       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH\n\n       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through\n       the window.\n\n                           BETTY\n                 With all his money they could have\n                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they\n                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin\n                 spends all his time tinkering out\n                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me\n                 it's all very strange.\n\n                           WOMAN GUEST #1\n                     (chiming in)\n                 He dug a huge hole out there for a\n                 swimming pool. Then he decided he\n                 didn't want it and filled the thing\n                 in. And what's that big, high fence\n                 for?\n\n       The women look at Calvin.\n\n\n\n       ANGLE - CALVIN\n\n       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 There currently exists a type of neon\n                 light that lasts five years.  But you\n                 won't see it on the market. Same is\n                 true of batteries. I could take your\n                 simple yacht battery and rig it to\n                 last a decade, easily.\n\n                           HAROLD\n                 Well, what the heck kind of a\n                 marketing system can't get great new\n                 products like that out to the public?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                     (intense)\n                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free\n                 market capitalism may not be a perfect\n                 order, but it's the best we've got, or\n                 will ever have.  And why?  Three\n                 reasons!\n\n       Poor Harold.\n\n       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME\n\n       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen\n       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily\n       jumps around the kitchen.\n\n                           WOMAN GUEST #2\n                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think\n                 about this trouble down in Cuba?\n\n                           HELEN\n                     (rolling her eyes)\n                 Oh, please don't bring that up!\n\n       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER\n\n       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into\n       the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n       SCENE 8 OMITTED\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER\n\n       Calvin is with another guest.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I'd say my baseball card collection is\n                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.\n\n       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.\n\n                           RON\n                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!\n                 \t\t(pointing over his shoulder)\n                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with\n                 Khrushchev on the television!\n\n       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others\n       follow.\n\n       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.\n       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears\n       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.\n\n                           JFK\n                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision\n                 to station strategic weapons for the\n                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is\n                 a deliberately provocative and\n                 unjustified change in the status quo\n                 which cannot be accepted by this\n                 country.\n\n       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns\n       it.\n\n       EXT. JET - NIGHT\n\n       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the\n       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF\n       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.\n\n       INT. JET COCKPIT\n\n       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a\n       very hard time controlling it.\n\n                           TOWER\n                 Wolf One -- say intentions.\n\n                           PILOT\n                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire\n                 and I'll need to find a clear area to\n                 eject.\n\n                           TOWER\n                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to\n                 the ocean?\n\n       EXT. JET\n\n       The trembling plane circles to the west.\n\n       INT. FAMILY ROOM\n\n       Return to TV.\n\n                           JFK\n                 ...we will not prematurely or\n                 unnecessarily risk the cost of\n                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even\n                 the fruits of victory would be ashes\n                 in our mouth.  But neither will we\n                 shrink from the risk at any time it\n                 must be faced.\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER\n\n       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the\n       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and\n       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere\n       in the middle we cut outside.\n\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this\n                 extraordinary turn of events, I think\n                 it's prudent that we cut the evening\n                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will\n                 resolve itself, but in the\n                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a\n                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!\n\n                           HELEN\n                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.\n                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap\n                 something up for you? Did you have a\n                 coat?\n\n       Helen can barely get a \"good night\" out before Calvin\n       shuts the door.\n\n       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB\n\n       Following their wives out.\n\n                 \t\t\tDAVE\n                     (sotto to Bob)\n                 What'd I tell ya?!\n\n       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.\n\n       INT. FRONT DOOR\n\n       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 It's time.\n\n                           HELEN\n                     (misinterpreting, holding her\n                      stomach)\n                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time\n                 yet. I still have--\n\n       He points down.\n\n                           HELEN (cont'd)\n                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm\n                 not sure I'm really ready for this.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 On the contrary, I think we're the\n                 only ones who are.\n\n       He leads her out of shot.\n\n                           HELEN (OC)\n                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to\n                 be all right. I just know it is!\n\n       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and\n       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player\n       has been left on:  \"How Much Is That Doggie In The\n       Window...?\"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is\n       wrapped in foil.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let\n                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you\n                 just put that seat cover back on that\n                 lawn chair?\n\n       He does.\n\n                           HELEN (cont'd)\n                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the\n                 phonograph?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 It shuts off automatically.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so\n                 clever.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 No.  They all do.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 I never know anymore.\n\n       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over\n       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and\n       looks up.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way\n                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!\n\n       INT. WORKSHOP\n\n       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--\n       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.\n\n                           TOWER\n                 An emergency has been declared. I\n                 repeat, an emergency has been\n                 declared.\n\n       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling\n       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 You hear that?!\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Yes.\n\n       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!\n\n       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the\n       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then\n       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.\n       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while\n       he and Helen are chatting:\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least\n                 let me do the dishes. It's not going\n                 to be that easy getting all that dried-\n                 on food off my nice plates.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I just hope those plates aren't\n                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that\n                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember\n                 that?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast\n                 and watch your step.  I'll come back\n                 for the radio.\n\n       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.\n\n\n       INT. JET - NIGHT\n\n       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey\n       cockpit.\n\n                           PILOT\n                 Tower, say again!!\n\n                           TOWER\n                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in\n                 sight.\n\n                           PILOT\n                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five\n                 and ejecting.\n\n                           TOWER\n                 Roger, Wolf One.\n\n\n\n\n       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and\n       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.\n\n       EXT. JET\n\n       The pilot ejects.\n\n       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT\n\n       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the\n       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-\n       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.\n\n       EXT. JET\n\n       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of\n       sparks.\n\n       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT\n\n       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It\n       misses him by a matter of yards.\n\n       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them\n       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.\n       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 How long will we have to stay down\n                 here?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I don't know. For this thing to blow\n                 over, it could take days.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Days??\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Rather safe than sorry.

That\n                 could happen any time.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I've read up on it.

JET - SAME TIME\n\n       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree\n       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES\n       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it\n       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.\n\n       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME\n\n       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like\n       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by\n       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the\n       roast.\n\n       EXT. JET - NIGHT\n\n       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as\n       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.\n\n\n\n       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS\n\n       They step into a darkened room.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                     (with arms spread)\n                 Home sweet home!\n\n                           HELEN\n                 To you maybe.\n\n       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF\n       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a\n       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder\n       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin\n       begins to shut by putting his body into it.\n\n       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM\n       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs\n       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The\n       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK\n       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles\n       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick\n       of time.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 What was that?!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Are you all right?!\n\n       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be\n       brave.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Yes, I think so.\n\n       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.\n       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's\n       labeled \"Radiation Count.\"  There are OTHER GAUGES that\n       are dropping to zero.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that\n                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are\n                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's\n                 actually happened!!\n\n       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER\n\n       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.\n       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME\n       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.\n\n       BACK TO SCENE\n\n       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS\n       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the\n       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 What's that noise?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 The locks.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 The locks?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 To keep us from trying to leave. After\n                 an atomic blast there's a radiation\n                 half-life that lasts thirty five\n                 years.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Thirty -five years!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Then after that it's safe.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 It's safe.\n\n       She continues to stare at him.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 To go up.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 To go up.\n\n       She continues to stare at him.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                     (confidently)\n                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're\n                 going to be just fine.\n\n       Helen bursts into tears.\n\n       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY\n\n       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.\n       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet\n       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's\n       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.\n\n                           LEVY\n                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy\n                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline\n                 nutcase.\n\n                           ATKINSON\n                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have\n                 been out here when the plane hit.\n\n                           LEVY\n                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',\n                 that's my guess.\n\n                           ATKINSON\n                 What about relatives?\n\n                           LEVY\n                 All back East.\n\n                           ATKINSON\n                 The neighbors over there said the guy\n                 spent day and night out here.

MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)\n\n       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and\n       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs\n       up and exits.\n\n       INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO\n\n       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty\n       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin\n       is heating the soda.

So, you know, when the time is\n                 up, we'll have to return to the\n                 surface using, you know, this back\n                 entrance.

Adam\n       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of\n       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and\n       flips a wall switch.

THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT\n\n       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left\n       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front\n       window and a \"For Sale or Rent\" sign.  There's ANOTHER\n       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it\n       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.\n\n       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS\n\n       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the\n       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a\n       tattoo on his forehead.)\n\n                           SODA JERK\n                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics\n                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin\n                 Anonymous.\n\n                           OTHER BUM\n                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?\n\n                            SODA JERK\n                 Shut up! All of these things... ask\n                 you to believe in a power greater than\n                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!\n                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a\n                 time or two... and I have certainly\n                 not seen anything coming from up there\n                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I\n                 can't afford to get on!\n\n       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER\n       AND RUMBLE.\n\n                           OTHER BUM\n                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!\n\n                           SODA JERK\n                 Let her come!  Let's get this over\n                 with!  And please, if there is a God,\n                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!\n\n       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back\n       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the\n       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with\n       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO\n       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by\n       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter\n       ticking.\n\n                           SODA JERK\n                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!\n                 For I have seen the light!!\n\n       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I come in peace!!\n\n       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea\n       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to\n       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his\n       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 My, gosh...\n\n       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He\n       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)\n       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic\n       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH\n       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and\n       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.\n\n       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING\n\n       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly\n       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to\n       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the\n       avocado trees should be.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Where is my backyard?\n\n       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY\n       to his left.\n\n       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING\n\n       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a\n       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present\n       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-\n       plated word \"Toyota.\"   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search\n       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the\n       avenue.\n\n       SCENE 76 OMITTED\n\n       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN\n\n       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt\n       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai\n       restaurant.)\n\n       CLOSER ON HIM\n\n       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a\n       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a\n       cigarette.\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 You got a light, honey?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a\n                 light!\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 Good.\n\n       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with\n       one of his kitchen matches.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 So...you...survived the blast, did\n                 you?\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a\n                 host of things. Like the song says: \"A\n                 country boy can survive!\"\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has\n                 it been...hell up here?\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 \"Hell up here?\"  Honey, it's been hell\n                 up here, down there and over yonder!\n                 Hell everywhere.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Yes, I can tell that just looking\n                 around.\n                 \t\t(then)\n                 \"Boy?\"  Did you say you were a\n                 \"country boy?\"\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a\n                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want\n                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be\n                 anything you want me to be!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Really?\n\n                           STREET WALKER\n                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the\n                 remarkably low price of only $200!\n                 And if you act now, I might even throw\n                 in some free lawn furniture.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                     (stumbling away from her)\n                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to\n                 go!  I have to...\n\n       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy\n       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a\n       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to\n       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the\n       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY\n       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom\n       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at\n       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the\n       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger\n       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol\n       is really a water gun.\n\n       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE\n\n       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the\n       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!\n                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!\n\n       The clerk just watches him.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Thank-Q very much!\n\n       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the\n       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS\n       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.\n\n       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER\n\n       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard\n       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great\n       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in\n       the corner.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 I'm going to give it to you straight.\n                 There's no point in beating around the\n                 bush. There were survivors.\n                 Apparently,\n                 the fallout has created....a\n                 subspecies of mutants.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Mutants?!\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out\n                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover\n                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that\n                 literally and I mean right now!\n\n       ADAM covers his ears and hums.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It\n                 seems...they can be both masculine and\n                 feminine...simultaneously.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 No.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Yes.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 I don't believe it!\n\n       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things\n       that don't need to be done.\n\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his\n                 body, Helen.\n                 \t\t(beat)\n                 They offer lawn furniture as a come\n                 on!\n\n       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin\n       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops\n       humming.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 They've done a lot of re-building but\n                 society, at least as we knew it, has\n                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in\n                 the streets. Others point guns.\n                 There's something terribly wrong with\n                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't\n                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,\n                 what do we do now?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 We stay down here.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 We do?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Yes.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Excuse me.\n\n       She hurries into the living room.\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into\n       the kitchen.\n\n       INT.

We're not going to make\n                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going\n                 up no matter what!

Behind her, we can\n       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living\n       room. He follows.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I\n                 don't know if he's had a heart attack\n                 or just... a horrifying experience.\n                 But we  need supplies and I've got to\n                 stay with him.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 I'll go up.\n\n       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 I'm afraid you've got to.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 I'll be all right.\n\n                           HELEN\n                     (patting his cheek)\n                 You're my brave boy.\n\n\n\n       Helen hands him a pencil and pad.

If anybody asks,\n                 simply say you're from out-of-town,\n                 and that you're in town on business.\n                 Write that down.\n\n       He does.\n\n                           HELEN (cont'd)\n                 I'm going to give you a shopping list\n                 and some money.  We need just enough\n                 things to get us through the next year\n                 or two.  And you'll find most of these\n                 items at what used to be called a\n                 grocery store or a hardware store.\n                 Write that down.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Yes, ma'am.\n\n       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is\n       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly\n       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred\n       dollar bills.

He\n       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and\n       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.\n       Helen enters with a long shopping list.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000\n                 which should take care of everything.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Yes, ma'am.\n\n                           HELEN\n                 Your father has a few final words for\n                 you.

At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her\n       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to\n       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Yes, father?!

Adam rises and starts for the door. But\n       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak\n       weakly into his son's ear.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 Also...stay out of the \"Adult\n                 Bookstore.\"\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Adult Bookstore.

Is that all?\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 One more thing.

MALT SHOP - SAME DAY\n\n       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious\n       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry\n       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and\n       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,\n       rocking back and forth as he prays.\n\n       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very\n       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth\n       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and\n       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance\n       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his\n       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the\n       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Are you all right?\n\n                           SODA JERK\n                 Yes!

The Soda Jerk falls to his knees\n       and shakes all over.\n\n       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on\n       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He\n       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he\n       looks up at the sky.\n\n       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY\n\n       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck.

Through the windows we see Adam go\n       down.\n\n       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS\n\n       The back door opens as Adam gets up.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!\n\n       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,\n       heaves a huge sign of relief.\n\n       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER\n\n       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors\n       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the\n       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.\n       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others\n       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.\n\n       INT. BAKERY COUNTER\n\n       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention\n       to the elaborate birthday cakes.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Is that a birthday cake?!\n\n                           CLERK\n                 Yes, it is.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Gee-ma-nee!\n\n       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.\n\n                           CLERK\n                 Bakersfield.\n\n       INT. AISLE\n\n       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a\n       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds\n       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that\n       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so\n       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an\n       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He\n       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing\n       trunks.\n\n                           ADAM\n                     (to himself)\n                 My first mutants.\n\n       INT. FRESH PRODUCE\n\n       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that\n       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-\n       AMERICAN CLERK.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Is this because of the radiation?\n\n                           CLERK\n                 What?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Nothing.\n\n       INT. MEAT COUNTER\n\n       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps\n       up.\n\n                           BUTCHER\n                 Help you?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Yes, please.\n                     (consulting his Mom's list)\n                 I'm looking for all beef patties.\n\n\n\n                           BUTCHER\n                 Fresh or frozen?\n\n       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?\n\n                           BUTCHER\n                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in\n                 the three pound box.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine\n                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And\n                 that's almost...five hundred dollars\n                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom\n                 only gave me three thousand dollars\n                 for everything!

He looks frantically out the\n       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At\n       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders\n       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually\n       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more\n       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps\n       up and tells the driver:\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!\n                 Please sir!!\n\n       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT\n\n       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the\n       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the\n       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his\n       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one\n       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but\n       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different\n       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk\n       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to\n       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost\n       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some\n       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself\n       he turns and begins to walk south.\n\n       ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders\n       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.\n\n       WIDER ANGLE\n\n       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,\n                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!\n\n       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW\n\n\n\n       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &\n       TRADED.\n\n       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar\n       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the\n       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a\n       fondness for Navajo jewelry.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Hello.\n\n                           JERRY\n                     (gives him a look, then goes\n                      back to reading)\n                 Hi.\n\n       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes\n       to another counter.  Neither man notices.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you\n                 buy baseball cards and although these\n                 are a lot older than the ones in the\n                 window, I was hoping you still might\n                 be interested.\n\n       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches\n       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then\n       must pretend the moan was a cough.\n\n                           JERRY\n                 How--how much do you want for the\n                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 I was thinking of selling all the\n                 cards.\n\n                           JERRY\n                 Really? No kidding?\n\n       He reaches in and looks through the cards.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 See, my problem is, all I have are\n                 hundred dollar bills and I need\n                 something smaller.

Tell you\n                 what...I'll give you five hundred\n                 dollars in small bills for the whole\n                 box.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Oh, that would be wonderful!\n\n                           JERRY\n                 Well, we're here to help!\n\n       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back\n       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.\n\n                           EVE (OC)\n                 Oh, shit!\n\n       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We\n       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her\n       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.\n\n\n                           JERRY\n                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.

Adam automatically lowers\n       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the\n       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips\n       them a mean bird and mouths the words \"fuck you\" as Adam\n       continues to pray. The guys shut up.\n\n       EXT.

We follow him as he\n       skates into an area that has been given over to the\n       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and\n       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He\n       takes them to be more mutants.\n\n       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty\n       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-\n       builder guy goes by on a bike.

That was close.\n\n       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND\n       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's.

Cliff takes\n       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam\n       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his\n       side.\n\n                           EVE\n                 Adam?!\n\n                           ADAM\n                 I'm sorry.\n\n                           CLIFF\n                     (increasingly insecure)\n                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.\n                 Fighting is pretty immature.\n\n                           ADAM\n                     (lowering his guard)\n                 It certainly is.

Cliff\n       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both\n       nostrils.

See, you'd eat like a\n                 slob if you\n                 were alone, but since another human\n                 being is present, you show that person\n                 respect by going to the trouble of\n                 having proper manners.

It's going to be all\n                 right in no time.\n\n       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of\n       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,\n       watching as he blows gently on her knee.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 I went to Sophie's and she was very\n                 hospitable.\n\n                           EVE\n                 Is that what you call it?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to\n                 be so I left as politely as I could\n                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the\n                 driver to drop me here instead of at\n                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como\n                 sings called \"On the Street Where You\n                 Live.\"  You know it?\n\n                           EVE\n                 Sing it to me.\n\n                           ADAM\n                     (softly, saying it as much as\n                      singing it)\n                 \"All at once am I--several stories\n                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--\n                 where you live.\"  It's about a young\n                 man who is overjoyed just to be\n                 standing in front of the house of the\n                 person he loves.\n\n       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws\n       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.\n       Then:\n\n                           EVE\n                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.\n                 Have you ever had sex before?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 No.\n\n\n       She sits up.\n\n                           EVE\n                 How is that possible?\n\n       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and\n       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is\n       mental.\n\n                           ADAM\n                     (sitting up)\n                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on\n                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our\n                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was\n                 born. We\n                 only survived because it was a huge\n                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My\n                 father worked on it secretly for\n                 years. When he had to, he used\n                 contractors, but always from out-of-\n                 state and always for just a portion of\n                 the job. He told them it was a secret\n                 government experiment done through\n                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he\n                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of\n                 course, it had to be a secret, because\n                 we had just enough supplies to last\n                 three people thirty-five years. That's\n                 also why I have no brothers or\n                 sisters. The air vent was the really\n                 tricky part, but he was able to cut\n                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd\n                 like to do Eve, is take you down into\n                 the fallout shelter with me. We could\n                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad\n                 said if I found a healthy girl I\n                 should \"bring her on down\".

The\n       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their\n       attention.  Then:\n\n                           ADAM (OC)\n                 Mom?!  Dad?!

Troy notices\n       \"TV Guide\" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page\n       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes\n       out the cigar box.\n\n                           TROY\n                 This it?\n\n       Eve nods.\n\n                           TROY\n                 What do you want to do with it?\n\n                           EVE\n                 Give it back to him.\n\n                           TROY\n                 And if we can't find him?\n\n                           EVE\n                 We'll find him.\n\n       INT.

It\n       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and\n       holds it as if it were his ring.\n\n                           TROY (OC)\n                 Hey, Eve?

ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT\n\n       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.\n       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot\n       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is\n       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their\n       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and\n       two customers become concerned.\n\n                           EVE\n                     (to Pakistani)\n                 Have you got a basement?\n\n                           PAKISTANI\n                     (indicating merchandise)\n                 Believe me, all the really good stuff\n                 is right here.\n\n                           EVE\n                 Is there a back entrance?\n\n                           PAKISTANI\n                 Are you kidding?

REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the\n       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed.

She clutches the cigar box and\n       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the\n       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them\n       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the\n       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt\n       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at\n       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just\n       used.\n\n                           EVE\n                 Adam!!\n\n                           TROY\n                 Where?!\n\n                           EVE\n                 Stop!\n\n       She rolls down her window.\n\n                           EVE\n                 Adam!!\n\n       ANGLE - ADAM\n\n       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.\n\n       ANGLE - EVE\n\n       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street\n       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,\n       Troy is there to retrieve everything.\n\n       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race\n       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the\n       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like\n       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to\n       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so\n       aggressive.\n\n       INT.

All\n                 you have to say is this...\"I don't\n                 care what it costs.\"  And then, of\n                 course, you've got\n                 to really mean it, which no one ever\n                 does.\n\n       EXT.

I can't\n                 ever let them know. It makes their\n                 life..well, frankly...\n                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You\n                 understand?\n\n                           EVE\n                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe\n                 me!

MALT SHOP - DAY\n\n       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda\n       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up\n       with a big lighted sign that says \"GIVE ME SHELTER.\"\n       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar\n       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet\n       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests\n       boarding the elevator.\n\n                           EVE (VO)\n                 It took a while to convince Archbishop\n                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he\n                 was pretty broken up about it, too,\n                 until I showed him my plans for Los\n                 Angeles' hottest and most original\n                 night spot.\n\n       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and\n       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.\n\n                           EVE\n                 You'll be a ten percent partner and\n                 still retain ownership of the\n                 entrance.\n\n                           SODA JERK\n                 Praise the Lord.

BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER\n\n       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through\n       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE\n       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives\n       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.\n\n                           EVE (VO)\n                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents\n                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make\n                 them very comfortable and then break\n                 the bad news to them that there was no\n                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't\n                 kill them Adam's going to tell his\n                 father about the Internet.\n\n       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY\n\n       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go\n       bonkers when they see the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.\n\n       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from\n       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new\n       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the\n       machine to investigate its workings.\n\n       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve\n       look on.\n\n                           ADAM\n                 You put the tape in here and you get a\n                 movie -- in your own home.\n\n       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on\n       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.\n\n                           EVE/TROY\n                 No!!\n\n       INT.

And I was going to wait a while,\n                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.\n                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I\n                 looked it up in old newspapers.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                     (after a while)\n                 You're sure?\n\n                           ADAM\n                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed\n                 without a shot being fired.

It's true.\n\n                           CALVIN\n                 What?

First the parents take\n                 care of the children and then the\n                 children take care\n                 of the parents. He says historically,\n                 that's how it works.\n\n       INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.
