DAN PIENAAR SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY\n\nDan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan\nschool. The students are mainly from middle-class\nfamilies. School athletics are in progress. The stu-\ndents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering\nenthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept\nsports ground.\nGORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-\ning in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-\nyears-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching\nthe games.\nBEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is\nenthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,\nwho is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last\nleg of the race. The excitement increases as they\napproach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son\nwith shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next\nto Ben, is shouting \"come on Johan,\" and slapping the\nfather on the back.\nJohan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The\nground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.\nBen hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud\nfather pushing his way through the animated boys. As he\nreaches Johan he pats him on the back.\n                           BEN\n             This was your best race.\n                           JOHAN\n                    (excited)\n             I beat him, Papa.\n\n                           BEN\n                    (proudly)\n             You did son.

There\n           isn't much to do, only weeding\n           the marigolds and watering the\n           lawn and flowers.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         2.\n\nCONTINUED:\n                           GORDON\n             We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir,\n             Jonathan come to help me.\nBen hadn't seen Jonathan.

A\ngroup of students are laughing and pushing each other\nboisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each\nother and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan.

The place buzzes with noise.\nSeveral people are touting wares for sale.\nSuddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the\ndrinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER\nstarts to address the clients.\n\n                           LEADER\n             Your children are starving and you\n             are drinking.

They need\n             thrashing.\n\nThe man and several others advance on the boys. The boys\nrun into the serving area, close the doors and start\nbreaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to\na halt outside. The boys run out through a side en-\ntrance. They are chased by the police who are black.\nJonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years,\nare walking towards the beer hall when the boys come\nrunning out chased by the police. It is prudent for\nthem to run down the street. The boys and police are\nbearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the\napperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen,\ntwo blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan,\nWellington and about ten of the boys are arrested.\nAs they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their\ninnocence without success and are driven away.\n\nINT.

Susan greets friends\nand acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.\nJohan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her\nfather, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan\nfrom a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off\nwith her parents.\nSUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She\ntakes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,\ncarries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her\nhusband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,\nconcerned, to a WOMAN.

Let those who rule this\n          land of ours listen to the word\n          of God; let them listen to our\n          peaceful and just demands; let\n          them be humble and go down on\n          their knees and seek forgiveness,\n          then listen to God.\nThe crowd roars:   \"Amanda!

There is pandemon-\nium, women screaming, people falling into graves or\ncovering in them.\n\nThe Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away\nin the opposite direction.\nThe press and television are recording the scene.

COURT ROOM - FIRST DAY OF INQUEST - DAY\nThe inquest of Gordon Ngubene... conducted by MAGISTRATE\nKLOPPER. In the witness box is DR. JANSEN, the state\npathologist, giving evidence. Advocate DE VILLIERS is\ncross examining.\n                        DE VILLIERS\n          Dr. Jansen, you are a state\n          pathologist of many years\n          standing and I have no doubt a\n          well-qualified pathologist.\n          Could you now please tell us\n          what caused the death of the\n          deceased?\n                        DR. JANSEN\n          I found that death had been caused\n          by the application of force to\n          the neck, consistent with\n          hanging.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         75.\n\nCONTINUED:\nThere's a vigorous reaction to this around the court,\nwhich gives us a chance to discover the crowd:\n\nIn the white section of the public gallery are Ben and\nabout eight other whites.\n\nThe black section is filled to capacity with a few stand-\ning. In the front row is sitting Stanley next to\nMargaret. At the entrance, a white policeman.\nIn the press section are several reporters; amongst them\nMelanie Bruwer the Rand Daily Mail reporter.\nColonel Viljoen and several policemen are sitting around\nthe court.\n\n                           DE VILLIERS\n             You are sure about the hanging?\n             This pressure on the neck, could\n             it also have been exerted in other\n             ways?\n                           DR. JANSEN\n             It could, but it is not for me\n             to speculate.\n                           DE VILLIERS\n             Of course not, Doctor. The list\n             of injuries found on the body was\n             horrifyingly long; bruises,\n             swellings, abrasions, broken rib,\n             lacerations, etc. How long before\n             death do you estimate he received\n             these injuries?\n                           DR. JANSEN\n             I couldn't say exactly.\n\n                          DE VILLIERS\n             Roughly.\n\n                           DR. JANSEN\n             Some were fourteen to twenty days\n             old, others three to four days and\n             others even more recent.\n\n                           DE VILLIERS\n             Even more recent. I see. I\n             understand you had a Dr. Hassiem\n             present at the autopsy.\n\n                           DR. JANSEN\n             That's correct.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          76.\n\nCONTINUED:\n                           DE VILLIERS\n             There were two reports, ours and\n             his. Did they tally?\n                            DR. JANSEN\n             Yes, it was.   In most respects.\n\nON Stanley listening.\n                           DE VILLIERS\n             Isn't it normal practice to have\n             one report? Why did Dr. Hassiem\n             decide to draw up a separate\n             report? If he really co-signed\n             yours.\n\n                           DR.

Consequently, I find\n             that Gordon Ngubene committed\n             suicide by hanging himself and\n             that on available evidence his\n             death cannot be attributed to any\n             act or omission or amounting to\n             a criminal offense on the part of\n             any person.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\nViljoen and Stolz smiling, shaking hands with Advocate\nLouw in congratulations.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\nINT.
