School athletics are in progress. The stu-\ndents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering\nenthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept\nsports ground.\nGORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-\ning in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-\nyears-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching\nthe games.\nBEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is\nenthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,\nwho is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last\nleg of the race. The excitement increases as they\napproach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son\nwith shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next\nto Ben, is shouting \"come on Johan,\" and slapping the\nfather on the back.\nJohan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The\nground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.\nBen hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud\nfather pushing his way through the animated boys. As he\nreaches Johan he pats him on the back.\n<b>                           BEN\n</b>             This was your best race.\n<b>                           JOHAN\n</b>                    (excited)\n             I beat him, Papa.\n\n<b>                           BEN\n</b>                    (proudly)\n             You did son.

A\ngroup of students are laughing and pushing each other\nboisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each\nother and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He\nfalls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to\nattack the boy. Gordon shouts \"Jonathan.\"\nThe headmaster, MRS.

The place buzzes with noise.\nSeveral people are touting wares for sale.\nSuddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the\ndrinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER\nstarts to address the clients.\n\n<b>                           LEADER\n</b>             Your children are starving and you\n             are drinking.

They need\n             thrashing.\n\nThe man and several others advance on the boys. The boys\nrun into the serving area, close the doors and start\nbreaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to\na halt outside. The boys run out through a side en-\ntrance. They are chased by the police who are black.\nJonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years,\nare walking towards the beer hall when the boys come\nrunning out chased by the police. It is prudent for\nthem to run down the street. The boys and police are\nbearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the\napperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen,\ntwo blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan,\nWellington and about ten of the boys are arrested.\nAs they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their\ninnocence without success and are driven away.\n\n<b>INT. SOWETO POLICE STATION - CHARGE OFFICE - AFTERNOON\n</b>The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench\nalong a wall. There is a reception counter with Sgt:\nVan Zyl in charge.

The others are     taken to the cells at\nthe police station, these include    Jonathan and\nWellington.\n\n<b>EXT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - DAY\n</b>The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old-\nminister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets\nhis parishioners as they file out of the church.\nAmongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean-\ncut, immaculate, \"toe-the-line\" beauty and his son, Johan\n-- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen-\nyear-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends\nand acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.\nJohan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her\nfather, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan\nfrom a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off\nwith her parents.\nSUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She\ntakes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,\ncarries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her\nhusband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,\nconcerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.\n\n<b>                           MRS. COETZEE (WOMAN)\n</b>             He won't come to church.
