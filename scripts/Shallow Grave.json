We have to dispose of the body in such a \n          way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, \n          then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, \n          dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either \n          by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I \n          have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the \n          forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which \n          we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as \n          simple as that.\n<b>          \n</b>          As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as \n          he looks at something off picture.
