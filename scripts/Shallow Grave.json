DAY\n          \n          A blurred image forms on a white screen.

DAWN \n          \n          A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. \n          \n          DAVID\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          This could have been any city: they're all the same.\n          \n          A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow \n          lanes and passageways.

DAY\n          \n          At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The \n          door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed \n          with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David \n          Stevens, and Juliet Miller.\n          \n          A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron \n          Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and \n          lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. \n          Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands \n          back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is \n          answered.\n          \n          CAMERON\n          Hello, I've come about the room.\n          \n          Cameron enters and the door closes.\n          \n          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY\n          \n          David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly \n          opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex \n          checks some items on a clipboard before speaking.\n          \n          ALEX\n          What's his name?\n          \n          DAVID\n          I don't know -- Campbell or something?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Cameron.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Cameron?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Yes.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (to Juliet)\n          Really?\n          \n          CAMERON\n          That's right.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (to Cameron)\n          What?\n          \n          Cameron is not sure what to say.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?\n          \n          CAMERON\n          Yes, thanks.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Good.

It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, \n          don't you think?\n          \n          CAMERON\n          Yes.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, \n          all that crap.\n          \n          CAMERON\n          Well, yes.\n          \n          ALEX\n          So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I \n          want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would \n          want to share a flat like this with someone like you?\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY\n          \n          As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out \n          against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          \n          I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that \n          you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a \n          prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like \n          presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're \n          being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered \n          accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I \n          don't think you're even trying.\n          \n          Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main \n          door.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!\n          \n          Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Do you think he was upset?\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY\n          \n          Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it. \n          Freeze-frame.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box \n          marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'.\n          \n          David opens the door to the Woman.\n          \n          WOMAN\n          I've come to see about the room.\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY\n          \n          Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about \n          twenty, rings the doorbell.\n          \n          INT. HALL. DAY\n          \n          Inside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it. \n          Freeze-frame.\n          \n          JULIET\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it \n          provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous \n          personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, \n          though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...\n          \n          Alex opens the door to the Goth.\n          \n          GOTH\n          I've come about the room.\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY\n          \n          At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the \n          bell.\n          \n          INT. HALL. DAY\n          \n          Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open \n          it. Freeze-frame.\n          \n          DAVID\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling \n          a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I \n          think of Juliet.\n          \n          Juliet opens the door to the Man.\n          \n          MAN\n          I've come about the room.\n          \n          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY\n          \n          In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed \n          individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. \n          the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see \n          are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We \n          do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see \n          some facial reaction.\n          \n          All of David's questions are to the Woman.\n          \n          All of Alex's questions are to the Goth.\n          \n          All of Juliet's questions are to the Man.\n          \n          DAVID\n          All right, just a few questions.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Why do you want a room here?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Do you smoke?\n          \n          ALEX\n          When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare \n          hands, do you then summon hellfire?\n          \n          JULIET\n          I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden \n          agenda?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either \n          divorced or you're not.\n          \n          DAVID\n          OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd \n          like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit \n          singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.\n          \n          ALEX\n          When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of \n          black to wear?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not \n          having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, \n          this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad \n          thing?\n          \n          ALEX\n          With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: \n          Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?\n          \n          JULIET\n          It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of \n          emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner \n          of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Did you ever kill a man?\n          \n          ALEX\n          And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are \n          the sunshine of my life'?\n          \n          JULIET\n          OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but \n          D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I \n          were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the \n          alphabet of love.\n          \n          DAVID\n          And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?\n          \n          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING\n          \n          In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash \n          court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and \n          David, who are inside the court.\n          \n          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING\n          \n          Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for \n          personal domination.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Serve.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I was trying to educate you.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Just serve.\n          \n          ALEX\n          In the same fashion as chess.\n          \n          DAVID\n          What?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Chess. Chess is often used as well.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Will you shut up and play.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You're a bad loser.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I haven't lost yet.\n          \n          Alex serves.\n          \n          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING\n          \n          The squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as \n          Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, \n          professional, sexual, everything. Next.\n          \n          Juliet walks in and closes the door.\n          \n          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING\n          \n          Inside the squash court Alex is about to serve.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Did you know --\n          \n          JULIET\n          Just serve.\n          \n          Alex serves.\n          \n          INT. JULIET'S CAR (A MINI). NIGHT\n          \n          Alex sits in the back, drinking.\n          \n          Juliet is driving. David sits beside her.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I wasn't trying to win.\n          \n          There is no response from Juliet.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to \n          know: I wasn't trying to win.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive \n          competitive urges.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You learn that in your psychotherapy group?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Discussion group, Alex, discussion.\n          \n          JULIET\n          I thought you stopped going.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people \n          should know that.\n          \n          Alex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex \n          flies forward, elbows him in the chest.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort \n          of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of \n          thing.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.\n          \n          ALEX\n          For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.\n          \n          JULIET\n          For the flat.\n          \n          ALEX\n          No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to \n          that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked \n          her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We \n          had chemistry.\n          \n          JULIET\n          She hated you --\n          \n          ALEX\n          Well, she had problems --\n          \n          JULIET\n          -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.\n          \n          ALEX\n          -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. \n          But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't \n          she?\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY\n          \n          Outside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits. \n          Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark \n          and bohemian in appearance.\n          \n          JULIET\n          You must be Hugo.\n          \n          HUGO\n          You must be Juliet.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Would you like to come in?\n          \n          HUGO\n          I'd be delighted.\n          \n          Hugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately \n          behind him.\n          \n          INT. VACANT ROOM. DAY\n          \n          Hugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches \n          him.

It's \n          about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't \n          die. You see, it's better already.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Writing seems easy.\n          \n          HUGO\n          It's a breeze.\n          \n          The telephone begins to ring out in the hall.

All I'm saying is, \n          it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's \n          on about, you know.\n          \n          Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to \n          leave the kitchen and get it.\n          \n          JULIET\n          (calling from outside)\n          He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know --\n          \n          INT.

He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? \n          Maybe it was just the emotion.\n          \n          Alex picks up the mail and looks through it. As he does so,David \n          emerges from his room, dressed for work.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          What do you think?\n          \n          DAVID\n          About what?\n          \n          ALEX\n          About this guy, this Hugo person.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I don't have time.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I'm only asking what you think.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I don't have time to discuss it now.

Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this \n          guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and \n          descend into open pornography.

He casually opens an \n          envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing \n          it to her.\n          \n          ALEX\n          David hasn't seen him either.\n          \n          JULIET\n          So I gathered.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Maybe he didn't like us.\n          \n          JULIET\n          David?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Hugo.\n          \n          JULIET\n          His car's still there.\n          \n          ALEX\n          He's got a car?\n          \n          JULIET\n          So what's wrong with that?\n          \n          ALEX\n          What sort of car?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I will ask you once more, what sort of car -- \n          \n          JULIET\n          A blue one, OK. And it's still there.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          We see the door to Hugo's room, then Alex rapping sharply against \n          it. David and Juliet stand behind him.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, \n          Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's \n          not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.\n          \n          ALEX\n          So?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Open it.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You want me to kick it open?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Yes.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Now?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Yes.\n          \n          ALEX\n          All right. No problem.\n          \n          After several ineffective kicks at the door, Alex turns to David.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          You want a go?\n          \n          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws \n          himself against it. At the third attempt the lock gives way and \n          the door bursts open.\n          \n          In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying \n          still and exposed.\n          \n          When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other \n          two. There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's \n          naked corpse. Alex opens a window.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Is this what they always look like?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Yes.\n          \n          Juliet drapes a sheet over the body, covering it completely.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I wonder how he did it?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Did what?\n          \n          ALEX\n          I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what \n          happened. What do you think?\n          \n          Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards, \n          emptying the contents on to the floor.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Alex.\n          \n          ALEX\n          What? What's wrong?\n          \n          JULIET\n          What are you doing?\n          \n          ALEX\n          I'm just looking.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Don't.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Don't look?\n          \n          JULIET\n          No.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you \n          wonder what he died from?\n          \n          JULIET\n          No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?\n          \n          ALEX\n          It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be \n          rational, please, and failing that be quiet.\n          \n          In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes \n          and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and \n          throws it on the bed.\n          \n          He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It \n          is empty and he pushes it back under.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I've never seen a dead body before.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.\n          \n          Alex continues to search. Juliet walks out.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Juliet stands alone.\n          \n          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while \n          David looks on, appalled but speechless.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the \n          telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and \n          rings.\n          \n          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David \n          norwe can see into it.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. \n          I mean, she was alive at the time.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Can I show you something?\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Juliet awaits an answer.\n          \n          Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and \n          looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the \n          receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a \n          second.\n          \n          OPERATOR\n          Hello, emergency services.\n          \n          The telephone hits the cradle.\n          \n          INT.

NIGHT\n          \n          David, Alex and Juliet are seated in silence around the tabel. \n          The bag, stacked with money, lies open on the table.\n          \n          DAVID\n          No.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Think about it.\n          \n          DAVID\n          No.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Come on, David.\n          \n          DAVID\n          No.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Juliet?\n          \n          JULIET\n          No, Alex.

DAY\n          \n          David sits at his desk, looking across the office.\n          \n          Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women \n          in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is \n          speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.\n          \n          David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on \n          either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He \n          turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants \n          sit.\n          \n          He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously \n          given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large \n          total at the bottom.\n          \n          When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She \n          smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding \n          scene.\n          \n          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING\n          \n          The body in silhouette.\n          \n          DAVID\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          OK. Let's do it.\n          \n          INT. DIY STORE. DAY\n          \n          Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the \n          background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked \n          with potentially vicious tools.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (VOICE-OVER)\n          All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a \n          way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, \n          then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, \n          dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either \n          by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I \n          have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the \n          forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which \n          we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as \n          simple as that.\n          \n          As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as \n          he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded \n          screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few \n          millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is \n          holding it.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          I always wondered what these were for.\n          \n          Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across \n          the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Now this is what we need. And this. \n          \n          Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. \n          Alex walks on.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Now what else? \n          DAVID\n          I don't know.\n          \n          ALEX\n          A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we \n          need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.\n          \n          DAVID\n          So who's going to do it?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Dig the pit, I don't know.\n          \n          DAVID\n          No, not that.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Then what?

Each of us, you, me \n          and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?\n          \n          DAVID\n          I can't do it.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I don't hear this.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I won't be able to.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you \n          don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat \n          smells. We can't wait any longer.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.\n          \n          Alex turns away in disgust.\n          \n          EXT. LANE.

NIGHT\n          \n          In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, \n          David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down \n          the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and \n          go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic \n          after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They \n          swear at one another and continue theri descent.\n          \n          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Tim is ducking the Man again.

NIGHT\n          \n          From the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. \n          The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely \n          still.

NIGHT\n          \n          Inside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body \n          is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in \n          the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just \n          visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again \n          and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the \n          door.\n          \n          INT. VAN. NIGHT\n          \n          In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. \n          Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. \n          Alex turns to the other two.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Why don't we just draw lots for it?\n          \n          The other two remain silent.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Whoever draws the short straw does it all.

FOREST. NIGHT\n          \n          Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of \n          the van come into view.\n          \n          It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is \n          switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the \n          van.\n          \n          In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David \n          and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of \n          grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds \n          them out.\n          \n          ALEX\n          All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play \n          or not?\n          \n          Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one \n          of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.\n          \n          Alex and Juliet turn to David. Alex holds out the stems. David \n          reaches out and takes one of the tips. It is the short straw.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I can't do it.\n          \n          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT\n          \n          Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little \n          light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His \n          right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a \n          vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished \n          with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at \n          another.\n          \n          Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He \n          observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Finished.\n          \n          ALEX\n          But not quite.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Is that going to be deep enough?\n          \n          Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards \n          David.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Don't you worry about that.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Is this necessary?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.\n          \n          Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who \n          gestures as if to say, \"On you go.' With revulsion on his face, \n          he raises the hammer above his head.\n          \n          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY\n          \n          David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his \n          pillow.\n          \n          He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. \n          There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Are you all right?\n          \n          DAVID\n          (without looking at Juliet)\n          Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Would you like to talk about it?\n          \n          DAVID\n          No.\n          \n          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY\n          \n          Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while \n          eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie \n          scattered at his feet.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. DAY\n          \n          The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, \n          letting in a pool of light.\n          \n          INT. HALL. DAY\n          \n          David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. \n          Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the \n          ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters \n          the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it \n          on up to David.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Be careful.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall \n          through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Stop nagging.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (to himself)\n          I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it \n          under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it \n          in the fridge.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. DAY\n          \n          David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way \n          across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.\n          \n          He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He \n          strains to see in the darkness.\n          \n          Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water \n          empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, \n          tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. \n          Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across \n          some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, \n          the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old \n          brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.\n          \n          David scrambles towards the trapdoor.\n          \n          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY\n          \n          Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation.\n          \n          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY\n          \n          In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the \n          ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For \n          Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are \n          yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one \n          of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues \n          past.\n          \n          EXT. QUARRY. EVENING\n          \n          Alex pushes a blue car into a quary.\n          \n          INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT\n          \n          In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks \n          of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which \n          sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to \n          Andy, who declines.\n          \n          They slide off the deep freeze and open it.\n          \n          Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. \n          They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.\n          \n          The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that \n          he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.\n          \n          They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid \n          while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.\n          \n          INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is \n          dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the \n          addition of a significant number of kilts.\n          \n          Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a \n          number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak \n          to them.\n          \n          A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is \n          standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to \n          the diners who are still sat at their tables.\n          \n          MC\n          Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of \n          all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting \n          our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.\n          \n          There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to \n          the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans \n          across to Juliet.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. \n          I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.\n          \n          Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Sshh.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I want my money back. Excuse me.\n          \n          Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his \n          fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already \n          ists in front of him.\n          \n          MC\n          For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of \n          mind, let someone else bother about these things.\n          \n          Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges \n          him viciously.\n          \n          MC\n          (CONTINUED)\n          But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you \n          to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this \n          occassion happen.\n          \n          The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation \n          continues back at the table.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Do you know many of these people?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Yes. They're my friends.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in.\n          \n          MC\n          And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither \n          or both --\n          \n          Drum roll.\n          \n          MC\n          (CONTINUED)\n          -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Are we going to dance?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?\n          \n          INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT\n          \n          The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather \n          chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, \n          with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and \n          jackets discarded.\n          \n          Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of \n          violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among \n          the other dancers.\n          \n          He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.\n          \n          David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and \n          at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.\n          \n          INT. TABLE. NIGHT\n          \n          Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace \n          floor, the trio sit drinking and Alex smokes a cigar.\n          \n          ALEX\n          That was good.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Can we talk about something?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Not now. I have an idea.\n          \n          Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to \n          do --\n          \n          ALEX\n          Just stop worrying.\n          \n          Alex stands and raises his glass.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Love and happiness for ever.\n          \n          JULIET\n          For ever and ever.\n          \n          Alex drinks, then puts his glass down. Juliet drinks but does not \n          drain her glass. David sits still.\n          \n          ALEX\n          What's the problem?\n          \n          DAVID\n          I want to talk now.\n          \n          ALEX\n          After you drink to love and happiness forever.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Now.\n          \n          ALEX\n          After.\n          \n          JULIET\n          David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.\n          \n          ALEX\n          It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.\n          \n          David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm \n          out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing \n          interest.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Look over there. It's Cameron.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Who?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Cameron.

It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!\n          \n          From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and \n          cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from \n          the table.\n          \n          CAMERON\n          What?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Nothing. We thought you were someone else.\n          \n          Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as \n          Cameron walks away, humiliated again.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us \n          around?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --\n          \n          BRIAN\n          (UNSEEN)\n          The divine Juliet. Long time no see.\n          \n          Brian approaches and is standing behind their table.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Brian.\n          \n          BRIAN\n          Would you care to dance?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Hold on there.

You interrupted us.\n          \n          BRIAN\n          I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you \n          talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply \n          in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a \n          fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.\n          \n          Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to \n          complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as \n          they watch him go.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?\n          \n          DAVID\n          I'm sorry.\n          \n          JULIET\n          It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.\n          \n          DAVID\n          That was stressful. I found that stressful.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', \n          I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the \n          full there.\n          \n          DAVID\n          You think so?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Well, you certainly had a good look around.\n          \n          ALEX\n          You were magnificent.\n          \n          INT. TOILETS. NIGHT\n          \n          The gents' toilet. Brightly-lit and white-tiled. Alex walk in and \n          goes into a cubicle and closes the door. We hear him whistling \n          and laughing as he passes urine. He keeps muttering bin-bag' to \n          himself. Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door. As he \n          does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone \n          waiting for him.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Cameron! What a surprise.\n          \n          As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in \n          the face and sending him flying backwards. Cameron enters the \n          cubicle and closes the door behind him.\n          \n          INT. HALL. MORNING\n          \n          Mail falls through the letter box.\n          \n          INT.

He looks towards \n          the kitchen, then walks to the door and opens it.\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING\n          \n          We hear the main door closing as David leaves. Alex jolts with \n          energy with every sound. The telephone begins to ring. Juliet \n          looks at Alex expectantly, but he does not move. Eventually she \n          gets up and answers it.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Hello. Hello.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Who was it?\n          \n          JULIET\n          Don't know. No one said anything.\n          ALEX\n          Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the \n          days when I had such a thing.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Are you all right?\n          \n          ALEX\n          No.\n          \n          JULIET\n          Then let's spend some money.\n          \n          INT. FLAT. DAY\n          \n          There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and \n          Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen \n          table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, \n          the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden \n          sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same \n          again.\n          \n          Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play \n          button on a tape recorder. The music begins.\n          \n          Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots \n          of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is \n          switched on and off.\n          \n          Alex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas.\n          \n          Juliet wearing several different outfits.\n          \n          Both of them posing with small objets d'art.\n          \n          The expensive watch on Alex's wrist.\n          \n          Juliet's jewellery.\n          \n          Expensive toys.\n          \n          Juliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera.\n          \n          Alex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film \n          himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie.\n          \n          ALEX\n          (CONTINUED)\n          This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and \n          you know, I'm so happy I could die.\n          \n          Darkness.

Is that it?\n          \n          JULIET\n          I don't see the point in that.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the \n          money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's \n          underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you \n          can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's \n          nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this \n          for nothing, so that I could have nothing --\n          \n          DAVID\n          Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.\n          \n          There is silence.

NIGHT\n          \n          Alex and Juliet sit at the table, eating in silence.\n          \n          The doorbell rings.

HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex approaches the door and is about to open it. At the last \n          moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole.\n          \n          INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT\n          \n          Tim and Andy stand outside the door.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening \n          the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as \n          the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.\n          \n          In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into \n          the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words \n          apart from slightly muffled cries.\n          \n          At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a \n          crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's \n          shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into \n          Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly \n          again, he takes the crowbar out.\n          \n          ALEX\n          It's in the loft.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can \n          just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a \n          shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool \n          around the opening.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform \n          darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is \n          David. He stands perfectly still.\n          \n          There is a hammer in his right hand.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts \n          himself through and balances on the beams.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly \n          there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing \n          heavily on and across some beams in the loft.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before.\n          \n          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else \n          but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living \n          room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks \n          back and up towards the trapdoor.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. \n          Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering \n          into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the \n          light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and \n          he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He \n          looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy \n          lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour \n          out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a \n          second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only \n          centimetres from his own.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud \n          thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then \n          Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down \n          to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his \n          head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes \n          one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his \n          mouth.\n          \n          Tim's body lands on Andy.\n          \n          David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.\n          \n          David takes a large knife from a wooden block.\n          \n          Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim. \n          Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to \n          lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks \n          at it, then stands up.\n          \n          He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still \n          bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then \n          extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.\n          \n          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT\n          \n          In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's \n          shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops \n          and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above \n          his head.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD.

Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from \n          him. David seems quite at ease.\n          \n          A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition.

On the screen of his word processor is a page \n          mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone \n          on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts \n          it fractionally and replaces it.\n          \n          INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S.

They went up alive \n          and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead \n          dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot.

LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          David sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs \n          several feet apart.\n          \n          DAVID\n          So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went \n          downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just \n          stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and \n          then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And \n          that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, \n          I don't think.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          did you hear anything before he cries?\n          \n          DAVID\n          No, not that I recall, I was asleep.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the \n          last few days?\n          \n          DAVID\n          No, nothing, sorry.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Well, if you do, you'll let us know?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Of course.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?\n          \n          DAVID\n          There are only two other people in the flat. \n          \n          McCall consults a notebook.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Two?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Who said there were four?\n          \n          MCCALL\n          We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of \n          course, but now, four.\n          \n          DAVID\n          No, three. Who said there were four?\n          \n          MCCALL\n          How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading \n          information. Only three people here. You're sure?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Yes, absolutely.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. \n          Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no \n          preference. Which are you using?\n          \n          MITCHELL\n          Both, sir.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my \n          tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I see.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          I doubt it.

Why do you think you woke and they didn't?\n          \n          DAVID\n          I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.\n          \n          Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even \n          this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has \n          underlined a short segment of it.\n          \n          INT. HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, \n          waiting to leave.

David looks \n          on.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Someone lost the key.\n          \n          McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall \n          illuminates Hugo's room.\n          \n          MCCALL\n          Is this where no one stays?\n          \n          DAVID\n          Yeah, that's right, that's it.\n          \n          David notices that Mitchell is writing this down.\n          \n          INT.

NIGHT\n          \n          Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the \n          trapdoor lock.\n          \n          ALEX\n          All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this \n          lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you \n          remain calm.\n          \n          There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder. \n          Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is \n          no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which \n          he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he \n          knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he \n          pushes the trapdoor open.\n          \n          INT. LOFT. NIGHT\n          \n          The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, \n          expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who \n          returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.\n          \n          He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into \n          corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.\n          \n          The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it \n          shines again.\n          \n          Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the \n          loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind \n          him.\n          \n          INT.

NIGHT\n          \n          Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in \n          danger.

He dips an arm into the tank, raises the \n          yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from \n          the water tank.\n          \n          INT. HALL.

A young Office Boy approaches his desk.\n          \n          OFFICE BOY\n          The editor wants to see you.\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING\n          \n          David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him.\n          \n          JULIET\n          I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are \n          now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you \n          become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked \n          after you.\n          \n          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY\n          \n          Alex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his \n          desk.\n          \n          EDITOR\n          Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond \n          recognition.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I don't know anything about it.\n          \n          EDITOR\n          Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything \n          about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.\n          \n          ALEX\n          Cover it?\n          \n          EDITOR\n          Well?\n          \n          ALEX\n          But there's no --\n          \n          EDITOR\n          Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, \n          we're short.\n          \n          ALEX\n          I don't know.\n          \n          EDITOR\n          Don't know what?\n          \n          ALEX\n          Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that \n          is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, \n          it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN. DAY\n          \n          David and Juliet are seated as before.\n          \n          DAVID\n          I'm sorry.\n          \n          JULIET\n          I should hope so.\n          \n          david turns towards her. He reaches out and softly touches her \n          face.\n          \n          DAVID\n          Maybe we can still sort everything out.\n          \n          Juliet takes his hand.\n          \n          JULIET\n          We can try.\n          \n          They look at one another.\n          \n          EXT. FOREST. DAY\n          \n          Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile \n          incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at \n          the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.\n          \n          From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the \n          burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, \n          and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape \n          draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the \n          exhumations.\n          \n          Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks \n          back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite \n          direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From \n          the green to the graves is hardly any distance.\n          \n          To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest \n          discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.\n          \n          BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY\n          \n          The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into \n          the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.\n          \n          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY\n          \n          David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her \n          bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up \n          against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before \n          pulling David towards her.\n          \n          INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY\n          \n          Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex \n          sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end, \n          three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking \n          Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then \n          McCall, both of whom sit in silence.\n          \n          UNIFORMED OFFICER\n          All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy \n          facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, \n          forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a \n          grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further \n          excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, \n          again containing human remains.\n          \n          Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial \n          site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at \n          it.\n          \n          While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed \n          Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory \n          of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back \n          and forth across the victim's limbs.\n          \n          UNIFORMED OFFICER\n          (CONTINUED)\n          As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to \n          ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as \n          identification, which will of course be passed on to you after \n          informing, where possible, the next of kin.\n          \n          Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.\n          \n          EXT. FOREST. DAY\n          \n          Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks \n          into a run for a few paces.\n          \n          The noise of the sawing continues.\n          \n          As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys. \n          He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down \n          to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his \n          knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a \n          moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.\n          \n          The noise of the sawing stops.\n          \n          From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his \n          hand rests on Alex's shoulder.\n\n\n          THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nShallow Grave\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Hodge\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:35:28.639751"}
