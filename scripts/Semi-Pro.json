THE STAPLES CENTER - PRESENT DAY\n\n          We hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on Kobe Bryant.\n          The real Bob Costas does narration.\n\n          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n          Before the NBA was the NBA, there\n          was another basketball league in\n          America...\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of\n          great plays are made by ABA stars.\n\n           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n          .From 1967 to 1976, there was the\n          American Basketball Association. A\n          maverick minor-league that would\n          change the game forever. The ABA\n          made the fast break FAST...\n          Invented the three point shot...\n          And introduced the world to\n          something called the Slam Dunk\n          Contest.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and\n          dunks in the world's first dunk contest.

The hair was big, the shorts\n          were short and the ball was red,\n          white and blue.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.\n\n           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n          In 1976, rumors of a merger spread\n          throughout the league.

Try a\n          behind-the-back!\n          Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence\n          isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits\n          him in the nuts.\n\n          CLARENCE\n          Ah, shit.\n\n          BUZZER!

White people\n          are assholes.\n          Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE\n          CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of\n          beauty.\n          Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops\n          at 'Love American Style.'\n\n          MONIX\n          You turned off the Celtics?\n\n          CLARENCE\n          I don't watch people play\n          basketball.

The Celtics\n          were practicing against you, Monix.\n          And when you ran that scout team,\n          you were running Milwaukee's\n          offense better than their first\n          stringers ever could.\n          Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the\n          toilet and preparing another syringe.\n\n          LYNN\n          By game time, your team knew where\n          Milwaukee was going to be before\n          their own players did.

Try standing on the other\n          side of Scootsie's man, so you free\n          him up to cut into the lane.\n          Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him\n          to stand.\n\n          MONIX\n          Widen your stance.

FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT\n\n          An intense game is underway. The Flint team works hard away\n          from the ball. As the Monix voice over continues, we watch\n          the team move just like in practice. Monix is playing too.\n          Note: The team also looks 'hot.' Clarence plays with an even\n          bigger afro. Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube\n          socks and the whitest thighs you've ever seen.\n\n          MONIX (V.O.)\n          .On offense, we share the ball.\n          We look for the easy pass, not the\n          spectacular pass...\n          Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first\n          time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear\n          passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          74.\n\n          MONIX (V.O.)\n          . If a guy's more open than you\n          are, he gets the ball...\n          Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The\n          Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we\n          continue to the voice over from practice...\n\n          MONIX (V.0.)\n          .On defense, we're going to learn\n          to play together. We're going to\n          use team traps to pressure people\n          into turnovers.\n          On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent.\n          Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the\n          fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.\n\n          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)\n          Can you believe that? Jumping\n          Johnny Johnson actually passed the\n          ball.\n\n          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)\n          It was a great pass, too.\n          The other team calls time out.\n\n          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.)\n          And Jackie Moon has made several\n          great defensive plays down the\n          stretch. I tell you, Jackie's not\n          afraid to knock people around in\n          the lane. He's a monster.\n\n          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)\n          Like a retard in a China shop.\n          A twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.\n\n          MONIX\n          (huddling up)\n          Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence,\n          protect the ball and penetrate if\n          you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or\n          me and everyone crash the boards\n          hard. Looking good, we're thirty\n          seconds away from taking this one\n          home. Let's bring it in.\n\n          JACKIE MOON\n          He's right guys. But remember, we\n          want to win, but not by too much.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          '75 .\n\n          TWIGGY MUNSON\n          We don't want to win by too much?\n\n          MONIX\n          What the Hell is he talking about?\n\n          CLARENCE\n          He's worried about the corn dogs.\n\n          MONIX\n          What?\n\n          CLARENCE\n          If we score a hundred points,\n          everyone gets a free corn dog.\n          There are signs everywhere.\n\n          JACKIE MOON\n          I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even\n          have corn dogs.\n\n          MONIX\n          I don't give a shit. We're taking\n          it to them.\n\n          JACKIE MOON\n          We're up by seven, Monix. Can't we\n          just take it easy? We're talking\n          about a lot of corn dogs here.\n\n          BEE BEE ELLIS\n          There could be a riot.\n\n          MONIX\n          I don't give a shit about the corn\n          dogs, okay? We play hard every\n          second. We're running the offense.\n          Everyone got that?\n          Everyone nods.
