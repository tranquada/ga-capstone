A series of\n          great plays are made by ABA stars.\n\n<b>           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n</b>          .From 1967 to 1976, there was the\n          American Basketball Association. A\n          maverick minor-league that would\n          change the game forever. The ABA\n          made the fast break FAST...\n          Invented the three point shot...\n          And introduced the world to\n          something called the Slam Dunk\n          Contest.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and\n          dunks in the world's first dunk contest.

But\n          despite the league's flair,\n          convincing fans to show up for\n          games was often a struggle.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy\n          Lewis wins a 'race horse.'

There were plenty of\n          punches too, giving the National\n          Hockey League a run for it's money.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns\n          and punches the guy in the face.\n\n<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n</b>          Yes, the ABA had a style all it's\n          own. The hair was big, the shorts\n          were short and the ball was red,\n          white and blue.\n          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.\n\n<b>           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)\n</b>          In 1976, rumors of a merger spread\n          throughout the league.
