He checks out\n          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.\n          \n          People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.\n          A parade forms behind him.

INT LIBRARY - DAY\n          \n          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,\n          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building\n          design.\n          \n          \n          3.

EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY\n          \n          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing\n          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.\n          \n          \n          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n          \n          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on\n          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of\n          futuristic looking structures). He crosses \"Abrams and\n          Abrams\" off the list. We notice several others are also\n          crossed off.\n          \n          \n          5.

EXT PARK - DAY\n          \n          Tom jogs. A little faster this time.\n          \n          9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,\n          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He\n          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost\n          in thought.\n          \n                                                                    109.\n          \n          \n          Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,\n          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.\n          \n          \n          9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY\n          \n          On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.\n          Thinking.\n          \n          On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress.

We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In\n          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took\n          Summer ages ago.\n          \n          \n          EXT. PARK - DAY\n          \n          Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost\n          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.\n          \n                                 SUMMER (V.O.)\n                       Hey.\n          \n          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She\n          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.\n          Tom isn't sure if she's real.
