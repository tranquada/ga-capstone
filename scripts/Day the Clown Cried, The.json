The long row of unkempt, yet \n\tbeautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up, with many \n\tof the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and \n\tthings around their own little areas... midgets running and \n\tplaying, like the little children they are about to \n\tentertain... MUSIC is in the deep background... as we COME \n\tTO A STOP at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed \n<b>\t...'GUSTAV - EUROPE'S PREMIER CLOWN.\"\n</b>\n\tWe PULL BACK and AWAY from the lettering on the trunk and \n\tREVEAL the face of a gentle but drawn man, a man whose body \n\tand movements indicate he has been at this for a long time.  \n\tAs he sits, the little midgets run close to see what they \n\tcan do to help; one pulls the chair for him to sit on; another \n\tbrings a hot cup of coffee; another takes his coat and hangs \n\tin on the hattree, adjacent to his trunk... as we PUSH PAST \n\tHIM to introduce the other clowns... some half made up, others \n\tfinishing their make-up... and some just sitting and rapping \n\ttogether, smoking, drinking coffee, waiting for showtime... \n\tand in the very distant b.g., almost against the wall of \n\tclown alley, we see the trunk and the body of a \"CLOWN\" in \n\tsilhouette... we CRAWL TOWARDS the body and the trunk... and \n\tCOME TO A STOP... HOLDING FULL FRAME.  The clown, already \n\tmade-up and dressed in his tramp outfit, has his head in his \n\thands, leaning down on the trunk table top, a depressed and \n\tsad looking hulk of a man... an o.s. voice:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MIDGET\n</b>\t\tCoffee?

He \n\tis yelling through an old megaphone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MIDGET\n</b>\t\t15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes \n\t\tto circus.\n\n\tUpon hearing this, \"Clown Alley\" really gets busy... all the \n\tclowns get up and put their last minute touches together... \n\ttouching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props \n\ttogether... and as they get themselves up and ready, they \n\texit the clown alley area and start for the arena.

She is tense and \n\tconcerned.\n\n\tShe sees something and moves toward the door and opens it.  \n\tThere is a beat and finally the o.s. SOUNDS of feet scuffling \n\tget to the door.

At completion of the long PAN \n\tintroducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish JOHANN \n\tKELTNER (formally ANDERLICH), a warm, sensitive looking \n\tgreying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about \n\thim... He walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly \n\tand tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct \n\twill help those that can't help themselves...)\n\n\tHis face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want \n\tto live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, \n\tgreets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be \n\tunder the same circumstances...\n\n\tHe walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks...\n\n<b>\tINT.

BARRACKS - NIGHT (DUSK)\n</b>\n\tWe now see the Barracks completely (SHOOTING from flat on), \n\tthe wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with \n\teight two tier bunks on each side.  A group of men are \n\tclustered around Keltner's bunk.  Here we meet:  ADOLF, a \n\tlarge, once powerful man, in his mid thirties.  LUDWIG, once \n\ta fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed \n\thim in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all \n\tover his face.  FRANZ, is the youngest.  He is a sensitive \n\tlooing twenty five year old, more than likely the \"rebel\" \n\ttype of the 1930s.\n\n\tHelmut is in his upper bunk over Keltner writing on an old \n\tpiece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make \n\ta point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher \n\tselling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper \n\tbag... (i.e. Brooklyn, circa 1928).\n\n\tWe TRUCK the CAMERA down the long barrack to include the \n\tother men doing their things.  A couple of men are getting \n\tready for a card game... several others are comparing \n\tclothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play \n\tchess.  A few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of \n\tthe men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... The \n\tfloors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the \n\twalls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn \n\tcalendar, wrong year, etc.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE - KELTNER GROUP\n</b>\n\tJohann sits with his back to CAMERA... at the edge of his \n\tbunk, leaving room on his bunk for Adolph, Ludwig, Franz.\n\n\tHe is showing something to them that we cannot see.  Keltner's \n\tbody covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking \n\tat, facing CAMERA... and they are indeed gawking with delight \n\tand admiration.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LUDWIG\n</b>\t\t\t(seriously)\n\t\tI think we should eat it!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  KELTNER\n</b>\t\tNot on your life...\n\t\t\t(catching himself)\n\t\tEr, that is...

He laughs delightedly now, \n\tsatisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY\n</b>\n\tHelmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the \n\tchild, and then attempts another hand stand.

Helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest \n\tthe mess hall, then peers cautiously back into the main yard.  \n\tSatisfied that he hasn't been noticed, he quickly puts one \n\tpiece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon.  \n\tHolding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl, he wolfs \n\tdown a few mouthfuls of the mush.  Then he smooths out the \n\tremainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched. \n\t He places the one slice of bread back on top of it, and \n\tstudies the end result.  Nodding approval, he licks his spoon \n\tclean and puts it back in his pocket.

PRISON YARD - PAN SHOT - CHILDREN - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe CAMERA is PANNING across the faces of about forty children \n\tbehind the fence as they watch Helmut o.s.  Some of them are \n\tlaughing; some clapping; some squealing with glee, and a few \n\tjust watching quietly, but with laughter in their eyes.  \n\tBehind them, near the barracks on the non-Aryan side, a number \n\tof adults also are looking on, but they hang back, fearful \n\tthat getting too close to the fence might provoke the always \n\tanticipated wrath of the guards.\n\n<b>\tEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY\n</b>\n\tWe see now that Helmut on his side of the fence is performing \n\tfor the children on the other side of the menacing barbed \n\twire fence.  Behind him, also at a safe distance because \n\tthey still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of \n\tthis, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching \n\this antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance \n\tof playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut \n\tplays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens.  \n\tThe CAMERA MOVES IN to --\n\n<b>\tMED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tAnd we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face.  \n\tWith charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide \n\tblack mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his \n\tcheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad \n\tand happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast \n\tlies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now \n\tHelmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of \n\tcardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he \n\thas gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the \n\tdirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a \n\tpile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and \n\tponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt \n\tinto a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it \n\tinto the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top \n\tto let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, \n\tbut when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes \n\tout.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an \n\tinspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm.  \n\tBut as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through \n\tthe open toe.  The children roar with delight.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\n\tShe is a flaxen-haired youngster of about five who holds a \n\tweathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at \n\tHelmut's performance.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY\n</b>\n\tHe is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven.  Each \n\ttime Helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs \n\thimself and spins around.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - BROTHER AND SISTER\n</b>\n\tThe girl is no more than four; the boy about eight.  He clings \n\tto her hand as they watch Helmut, unsmiling, perhaps not \n\tunderstanding.  The boy looks at his sister, and a tiny smile \n\ttugs at her mouth.  The boy smiles back.  The girl giggles.  \n\tThe boy laughs outright.  They have re-discovered happiness.\n\n\tThey look back at Helmut, both laughing.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - SISTERS\n</b>\n\tThe older girl is ten or eleven; her sister five or six, \n\ttugs at her arm, and the older girl bends down to her.  The \n\tyounger girl whispers to her, pointing to Helmut, and the \n\tolder girl picks her up.  The little one puts her arms tightly \n\taround her sister's neck.  Both laugh merrily.\n\n<b>\tMED.

He sucks in his belly, but \n\tthen his pants begin to slip, and he grabs at them with an \n\tembarrassed look at the laughing children.\n\n\tDeciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch \n\this shoulders, he tries that, but now his shoulders must \n\tremain hunched.  He manages to pick up the broom and puts it \n\tover his shoulder, playing soldier.  But when he tries to \n\tsnap to attention, the coat pops open again, bringing another \n\troar of laughter from Helmut's audience.\n\n\tNow he marches a few steps toward the CAMERA, stops, snappily \n\tputs the rifle down at rest position and salutes -- knocking \n\thimself flat.  Another roar of laughter.  As it swells, we --\n\n<b>\tPAN SHOT - JEWISH PRISONERS\n</b>\n\tThe laughter o.s. continues to swell as the CAMERA PANS across \n\tthe faces of the adult Jewish prisoners huddled near their \n\thuts.

He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result \n\tis a self-conscious giggle.\n\n\tAs the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though \n\twafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we \n\tsee two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the \n\tperformance below them.

Holding a \n\tfinger to his lips:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tShhh.  Shhhh.  The guards...\n\n\tThe children quiet down and press closer to the fence.  Helmut \n\tdrops to his knees, looking around.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  CHILDREN\n</b>\t\tDo a trick, Doork.  Please, Doork, \n\t\tplease, please.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNo, no.  I can't.

She regards Helmut solemnly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\t\tThey're bad.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tSmiling wryly at the simplicity of this appraisal, Helmut \n\treaches through the fence and pats the head of the girl's \n\tdoll.\n\n\tEager to touch Helmut, another child take his hand, others \n\tgrab at his arm.  Still other youngsters, following this \n\tlead, try to reach through the fence to touch him.  Obviously \n\tenjoying this adulation, Helmut takes as many of the little \n\thands as he can, squeezing them affectionately.  Only one \n\tgroup of eight children hangs back.  They do not seem to \n\tunderstand what this is all about.  Their little faces are \n\tfearful, yet they are fascinated by Helmut.  Suddenly one \n\tlittle boy gives a yelp of pain and backs away from the wire, \n\tclutching his forearm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tWhat is it?  What happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\t\tHe hurt himself.\n\n\tWide-eyed with fright, the little boy takes his hand away \n\tfrom his arm to reveal a nasty looking scratch from one of \n\tthe barbs on the fence.  Seeing his own injury, the youngster \n\tbursts into tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tShhh.  Shhh.  Don't cry.  It's going \n\t\tto be all right.\n\t\t\t(to the other children)\n\t\tBe careful when you're near this \n\t\tfence.\n\n\tHe consoles the little boy, who continues to cry and holds \n\tup his wounded arm for Helmut to see.  Helmut looks around \n\tfrantically, as if hoping to find help somewhere.  Then he \n\tquickly removes his ascot -- his precious trademark, the \n\tsymbol of his self-accorded status -- and hands it through \n\tthe fence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tHere, wrap this around it.  I'll \n\t\tmake it all better.\n\n\tThe little boy goes on crying, but some of the other children \n\ttake the cravat and fashion it into a crude bandage around \n\tthe youngster's arm.  It fails to silence the boy's crying, \n\thowever.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\t\t(worried)\n\t\tHush now.  Stop crying.  Please.  \n\t\tLook... Look at this.\n\n\tHe begins shuffling around on his knees, imitating a duck in \n\tan effort to appease the crying child.  As he goes, Helmut \n\tquacks softly.  The boy stops crying, but his face remains \n\tunhappy.  The other children laugh in spite of Helmut's \n\tefforts to keep them quiet, all but the group of eight \n\tyoungsters who only stare at Helmut in awe.  Seeing that he \n\tis making progress with the crying child, Helmut next pulls \n\this coat up over his head and, still on his knees, moves \n\taround like a headless man, groping ahead with his hands.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY\n</b>\n\tHis frown gradually dissolves and, in spite of his sniffling, \n\the smiles, timorously at first, then broadly.  Finally, he \n\tlaughs.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tHelmut shrugs his jacket back into place and smiles at the \n\tboy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tThere, that's better.  No more crying \n\t\tnow.\n\n\tFor the first time he notices the other group of frowning \n\tchildren.  Among the other smiling and laughing youngsters, \n\tthey seem to stand out.  When Helmut fastens a quizzical \n\tlook on them, they back away a little, fearfully.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tWhat's the matter with them?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\t\tThey're new.

I'll show you... No \n\t\tnoise now.\n\n\tIn pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and \n\tthreads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing \n\tthis, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding \n\tthe thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews \n\twith his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he \n\thas sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be \n\tembarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, \n\tbut in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes \n\ttoo.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his \n\tfrantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket.\n\n\tThe silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics.  \n\tSome look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the \n\tentire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for \n\tsilence, but the grin on his face says he loves it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNo, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh.  \n\t\tShhhh.\n\n\tThe children go on laughing as if this is just part of the \n\tgame.\n\n<b>\tMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS\n</b>\n\tThe SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards \n\tin a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who \n\thas been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner \n\tand points down to Helmut.\n\n<b>\tLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV\n</b>\n\tBetween the children at the fence and the line of soccer \n\tspectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing \n\tup and down.  But that is enough.\n\n<b>\tMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS\n</b>\n\tAfter a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone \n\tand starts to make a call.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tHelmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus \n\tof the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand \n\tspring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his \n\tside and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs \n\tappreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again \n\tHelmut tries the hand spring and again he flops.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - PRISON YARD\n</b>\n\tA HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond \n\tthem the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still \n\tin progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action \n\twhooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS \n\tofficers, and the guard in charge of barracks \"H\", come \n\tbursting through the spectators near the huts and into the \n\tgame itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize \n\twhat is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard.  \n\tThe cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, \n\tthe prisoners' warning to Helmut.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tOblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the \n\tchildren again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something \n\tunderfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his \n\tbalance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children \n\tseem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he \n\tlands on the ground, they do not laugh.\n\n\tAgain their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut \n\tlooks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is \n\twrong, he turns and looks up from the ground.\n\n<b>\tANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n\tSHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and \n\tsoldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and \n\tstand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily \n\twatching for the next move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GUARD\n</b>\t\tYou wouldn't listen, would you?\n\n\tAlmost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something \n\the likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no \n\tchoice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that \n\tsome non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the \n\tdisturbance is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GUARD\n</b>\t\t\t(to the children)\n\t\tGo on.

It \n\t\twas all my doing.\n\n\tThe guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him \n\tfor a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across \n\tthe face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and \n\tfalls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children \n\tstill near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their \n\tterror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another \n\tact.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at \n\tthe children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself \n\tdown again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS \n\tOFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard.\n\n\tHe holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he \n\trepeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks \n\tdown at Helmut.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FIRST SS OFFICER\n</b>\t\tGet up.\n\n\tHelmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the \n\tchildren.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, \n\twinks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer \n\tand the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates \n\tthe SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it \n\tdown hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The \n\tchildren scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick \n\tto hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive \n\treaction, catches hold of his arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  KELTNER\n</b>\t\tThe children!

The Second SS Officer whips his pistol out, aims \n\tcarefully and FIRES a shot into Franz's head.\n\n<b>\tVARIOUS SHOTS OF THE PRISONERS\n</b>\n\tUhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded.  Galt cowers.  \n\tBeads of perspiration pour from his brow.  Adolf weeps bitter \n\ttears as Herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort \n\thim, and himself as well.  Ludwig, dead to any emotion, simply \n\tturns and walks away into the crowd.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tHelmut is now, more than ever, the clown, as he goes into a \n\tfrenzied version of the \"Clap Dance\".  The complete \n\tincongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned.\n\n<b>\tWIDER ANGLE - SHOWING THE CHILDREN IN B.G.\n</b>\n\tThe children are no longer screaming, instead they are \n\twatching Helmut as though they are hypnotized.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD, SS MEN, OTHER GUARDS\n</b>\n\tThe guard, fully aware that the sadist SS men may take action \n\tagainst Helmut, quickly motions for two of the other guards \n\tto take Helmut away.  The First SS Officer, still panting \n\twith exhaustion, shows his approval of the action taken by \n\tthe guard.  The two guards seize Helmut by the arms and begin \n\tdragging him off toward the administration building.  The \n\tprisoners move away before the guards holding Helmut, forming \n\ta sort of line of march for them.

BOXCAR - HELMUT'S POV - DAY\n</b>\n\tIn one end of the car the children are huddled together in \n\tone frightened, wailing mass.  They do not even notice Helmut \n\tat first, so great is their sorrow.  The little ones cling \n\tto the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together.  The \n\tsmall ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have \n\tbeen crying for a very long time.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK so \n\tthat Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, \n\tthrowing more light on the children.  This brings renewed \n\twalls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together \n\tmore fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, \n\texpecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear-\n\tfilled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, \n\tmuch less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER \n\tGIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at \n\tHelmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  OLDER GIRL\n</b>\t\t\t(tentatively)\n\t\tDoork?\n\t\t\t(shrill with \n\t\t\trecognition)\n\t\tIt's Doork.  It is!

They repeat his \n\tname time and again:  \"Doork, Doork, Doork.\"  As one... the \n\tyoungsters surge toward him.  The little boy who first saw \n\thim reaches him first.  He drops to his knees and puts his \n\tarms around Helmut's neck, hugging him furiously.  Helmut \n\treturns the embrace.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  BOY\n</b>\t\tI want to go home.

He heaves himself forward partially into it, \n\tand the children grab his clothes to help him inside.  A \n\tcouple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and \n\tfinally pull him in.\n\n<b>\tINT.

Others do the same, and still others, including \n\tthe Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at \n\teach other and loving it.  Then, out of sheer adoration, the \n\tyoungest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around \n\this legs.  Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches \n\tout his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost \n\tas if trying to protect them.  Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, \n\tand the children go solemnly silent.

Three!\n\n\tThis brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, \n\tsit down... the Czechs following the example of the others.  \n\tHelmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces \n\tof black bread.  The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it \n\tvoraciously.  When all of the youngsters have been given the \n\tbread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great \n\trelish.  After a few chews on the bread:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNow... what'll we do?\n\n\tThere is a long moment of silence, then the little blonde \n\tgirl with the rag doll speaks up timidly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\t\tI want to see my Mommy.\n\n\tHelmut is brought up short.

Realizing that words won't \n\thelp, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading \n\ther with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation.  \n\tIt is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect.  \n\tThe girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he \n\tmakes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to \n\ttouch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an \n\taffectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over \n\this face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he \n\tlaughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the \n\ttraces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles.  \n\tHis conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster \n\tup, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance \n\twith her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs \n\toutright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her \n\ton the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for \n\ta return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's \n\tcheek a peck.

Helmut is asleep on the floor with the \n\tchildren huddled around him.  He lies on his side with one \n\tarm thrown protectively over the little Czech girl, Inga, \n\tand Willie.  Behind him, the Czech birthday boy and the girl \n\twith the doll are cuddled close to him.  Other youngsters \n\thave their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close \n\tto him as they can get.\n\n\tHe is, in fact, a sort of human bed.  From the train NOISES \n\to.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down.  \n\tThen, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we HEAR a truck engine \n\tapproaching.  Helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his \n\tbearings.  This arouses some of the children and they too \n\tsit up and look around.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  CHILDREN\n</b>\t\tWhat is it?

Sir... could I... could I \n\t\thave a little time with them before \n\t\t... before...\n\n\tHis voice trails off.  Runkel looks at Helmut while he thinks \n\tit over.  He moves back to the middle of the cell.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  RUNKEL\n</b>\t\tYes.  Yes, of course.\n\t\t\t(he looks at his watch)\n\t\tI can give you about half an hour.\n\t\t\t(a little smile lights \n\t\t\this face)\n\t\tYou see, we're not heartless men \n\t\there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY\n</b>\n\tANGLE to the door as Helmut and the Sergeant approach from \n\to.s.  Helmut has freshened his make-up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  SERGEANT\n</b>\t\tRemember what I told you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tThere won't be any trouble.\n\n\tHelmut goes to the door and starts to open it.  The CAMERA \n\tMOVES UP to --\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tWith a great effort, he composes himself and throws open the \n\tdoor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY\n</b>\n\tANGLE to the door, where Helmut stands wearing an enormous \n\tgrin.  The children are about the barren room in little \n\tgroups.  When they see Helmut, they leap up and run to him, \n\tclinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves \n\tinto the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  CHILDREN\n</b>\t\tDoork, Doork, you came back.  You \n\t\tcame back.  We thought you'd left \n\t\tus.  Don't leave us, Doork.\n\n\tThe children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear \n\tand delight at his return.  Helmut goes among them, patting \n\ttheir heads comfortingly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tThere.  There.  It's all right. It's \n\t\tall right.   Everything is going to \n\t\tbe all right.\n\n\tWhen the youngsters are calmed, Helmut holds up his hands \n\tfor silence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNow I want everyone to put on a big \n\t\tsmile and sit down, because we're \n\t\tgoing to have more fun than we've \n\t\tever had.\n\n\tSlowly, still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear, \n\tthe children sit on the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tGood.  We'll start by seeing that we \n\t\tall have our names on our heads.\n\n\tThe children begin to lower their heads so Helmut can check \n\tto see if their names are still there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\t\t(as he moves among \n\t\t\tthem)\n\t\tYes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria, \n\t\tSadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, \n\t\tWillie...\n\n\tThe little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut \n\tto see.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tAh, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see \n\t\tall of your names.\n\n\tThis is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control \n\thimself by turning away for a beat.  Then he turns back to \n\tthe children, his big smile back in place.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNow... on with the show.  Just watch \n\t\tthis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tPAN SHOT - CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tTheir little faces are troubled, worried.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tPAN SHOT - CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tIt is a half hour later, and now the children are laughing \n\tat something Helmut is doing o.s.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to --\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - THE GROUP\n</b>\n\tHelmut is walking an imaginary tightrope.  Every few steps \n\the almost loses his balance, but with comical gyrations he \n\tmanages to complete the walk.  He bows deeply to the children -- \n\tand falls flat on his face.  The youngsters laugh, applaud \n\tand squeal delightedly.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - HELMUT, WILLIE\n</b>\n\tHelmut is lying on the floor near the boy.  He looks up at \n\tthe tot and grins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  WILLIE\n</b>\t\tDoork!  Doork... you're great !\n\n\tHelmut grabs Willie and holds him close while he fights back \n\this tears.   Willie plants a big kiss on his cheek.  Helmut \n\tscrambles to his feet, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --\n\n<b>\tWIDER ANGLE\n</b>\n\tSHOOTING PAST Helmut to the door as it opens, revealing the \n\tSergeant, his face expressionless.  Helmut reacts.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  SERGEANT\n</b>\t\t\t(to Helmut)\n\t\tIt's time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tJust a few more minutes?\n\n\tThe sergeant shakes his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tI'll bring them.\n\n\tThe children are watching him, puzzled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  CHILDREN\n</b>\t\tWhat's the matter, Doork?

Let's make it a big \n\t\tcircus parade.  Everybody get in a \n\t\tline behind...\n\n\tHe picks up Willie and stands him near the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... behind Willie here.\n\n\tThe children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the \n\tvery proud Willie.  Helmut looks around for the boy with the \n\tharmonica.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tNow, where's our band?  The harmonica?\n\n\tHe sees the boy and goes to him.  Helmut pantomimes playing \n\tthe harmonica and points to himself.  The boy smiles widely, \n\tfishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HELMUT\n</b>\t\tThere we are?  Everybody ready?  \n\t\tHere we go.\n\n\tHelmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the \n\tPied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a \n\tcrude sort of circus parade music.  The little children giggle \n\texcitedly as they troupe out.  The older ones seem less \n\tcertain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY\n</b>\n\tAs the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks \n\twith Helmut dancing along at its head.  The Sergeant and the \n\tother two Guards stand watching in disbelief as the line \n\tturns and moves along toward the first of the windowless \n\tbuildings.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS\n</b>\n\tThey look at each other incredulously.  What they are seeing \n\tsurpasses their imagination.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tSHOOTING from a HIGH ANGLE as the procession moves toward \n\tthe CAMERA.  Helmut looks back at his charges from time to \n\ttime, smiling and waving and always puffing away on the \n\tharmonica.  The children smile back, some timidly and some a \n\tbit fearfully, but all smile.\n\n<b>\tPAN SHOT - PARADE\n</b>\n\tCAMERA PANS in on the children as they march behind Helmut.  \n\tWe see some of them strutting, their little arms swinging \n\tfreely.  Some of the little ones have to skip to keep up \n\twith the others.  They are all smiling.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tWith each step, Helmut looks about, his eyes searching heaven, \n\tpraying for the miracle that will save the children... the \n\tsudden blast of thunder, the striking down of the guards.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS\n</b>\n\tAs they follow the parade warily, almost as if expecting a \n\ttrick.  They wear scowls worn into their faces by long use.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - BUILDING - HELMUT'S POV\n</b>\n\tIts steel door gapes open.  Through the open doorway we can \n\tsee a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads \n\tjutting from the wall.  A single ceiling light gives the \n\troom a stark appearance.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK and UP as \n\tthe procession comes up toward the building.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tDespair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no \n\tmiracle.  He looks ahead into the room, his courage fails \n\thim and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him \n\trun into his legs.  He turns and looks at them, then back to \n\tthe door.\n\n<b>\tWIDER ANGLE\n</b>\n\tAlmost reluctantly, Helmut stands aside.  He tries to smile, \n\tbut the result is almost grotesque.  He tries to speak, but \n\tno words come.  The Sergeant and the guard drift up toward \n\thim, scowling.  Gently, Helmut tousles the hair of little \n\tWillie and steers him through the door into the room.  The \n\tother children follow him hesitantly.  Helmut puts the \n\tharmonica to his lips and begins playing again.\n\n<b>\tANOTHER ANGLE - TAKING IN SERGEANT AND GUARDS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FIRST GUARD\n</b>\t\tTheir clothes!  They've got to \n\t\tundress.\n\n\tThe sergeant starts to move toward the line of children, the \n\tSergeant grabs his arm and stops him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  SERGEANT\n</b>\t\tLeave them alone.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN\n</b>\n\tSHOOTING over Helmut's shoulder down at the children as they \n\tfile past him.  Each one hesitates a beat before him and \n\tlooks up at him.\n\n\tTheir faces are wondering, but trusting.  They smile \n\ttentatively.  Only the little girl with the doll hangs back, \n\twaiting for something rather than fearful of entering.  When \n\tall of the other children have gone in, she goes up to Helmut \n\tand wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to \n\tenter with him.  In her eyes is the absolute certainty that \n\the will.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT - LITTLE GIRL'S POV\n</b>\n\tHe looks down at her hand for a long beat.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\n\tThe little girl waits for Helmut, but he doesn't take her \n\thand.  Shyly, she begins to withdraw it.  Suddenly, Helmut \n\treaches out and grabs her hand, clutching it desperately as \n\the needs her innocence to control the panic that is tearing \n\tat him.  Holding on to her to steady himself, they walk \n\ttogether into the room, the CAMERA PANNING with them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. CHAMBER - DAY\n</b>\n\tANGLE to the door as Helmut and little girl enter.  Suddenly, \n\tthe door slams shut behind them.  Helmut whirls to it \n\tinstinctively, as if to shove it open or cry out for help, \n\tbut he does neither.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT\n</b>\n\tHis face is pressed against the steel door.  He fights the \n\tpanic within him.  Then, he quickly wipes his eyes and turns \n\tback towards the children.  Slowly he takes three chunks of \n\tstale bread from his coat pocket and begins juggling them, \n\tat the same time waggling his head from side to side, slowly \n\tat first, then more gaily.  From deep inside him comes a \n\ttiny, tiny laugh.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to reveal \n\tthe children in the f.g.  Suddenly, Helmut tosses the pieces \n\tof bread high, high into the air and stretches out his arms \n\tto encompass all the children.  As they gather around him, \n\tthey take up his soft laugh, timidly at first, then more \n\tassuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tIF ANOTHER MAN'S CHILD IS THREATENED AND YOU MOVE NOT TO \n</b><b>\tPROTECT IT, THE CHILDREN OF ALL MEN ARE IN JEOPARDY AND YOU \n</b><b>\tSTAND AS GUILTY AS THOSE WHO THREATEN.\n</b>\n<b>\tJOHN F.
