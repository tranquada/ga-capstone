He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold \n               to hold in one hand.\n\n \n                                     FRIEND 4\n\n                         Is it hot?\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         No. It's freezing.\n\n\n               The police officers and the other people gathered around feel \n               a vibration under their feet.\n\n \n                                     COP 2\n\n                         What is that?\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         You feel that?\n\n\n                                     FRIEND 3\n\n                         Yeah, I feel that.\n\n\n                                     FRIEND 4\n\n                         What is it the subway?\n\n\n                                     COP 1\n\n                         There's no subway here.\n\n\n                                     FRIEND 4\n\n                         PATH Train maybe?\n\n\n                                     COP 1\n\n                         That can't be the water main. \n\n\n                                     COP 2\n\n                         There's nothing else down there.\n\n\n                                     COP 1\n\n                         The water main doesn't run through here.\n\n \n                         \n                                     COP 2\n\n                         Well, there's something down there and \n                         it's moving.\n\n \n               The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start \n               running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows \n               start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even \n               more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone \n               on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering \n               windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and \n               moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement \n               lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something \n               throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the \n               air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The \n               police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the \n               ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes \n               out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide \n               behind a building. \n\n \n                                     FRIEND 4\n\n                         Oh my god.\n\n\n               Ray begins walking out from behind the building.\n\n\n                                     FRIEND 4\n\n                         Ray, no, stay man.\n\n\n               The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to \n               other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. \n               People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the \n               beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding \n               into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous \n               beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again \n               Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. \n               He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator \n               beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides \n               behind a building as the machine walks by.\n\n \n               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING\n\n\n               Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking \n               eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking \n               at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the \n               kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With \n               anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...\n\n \n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         What happened?\n\n\n               Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the \n               kitchen, not responding.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         What's going on?\n\n\n               Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on \n               the stool at the island.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Dad, what's the matter?\n\n\n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         What's all that stuff all over you?\n\n \n                         \n               Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.\n\n                         Rachel reaches through a leg of the \n                         island to pull at Ray's hood on his \n                         shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his \n                         head toward Rachel fast enough to make \n                         some of the white powder poof off as \n                         if jerked back into reality. Robbie \n                         jumps as well in fright.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         What's all the stuff?\n\n\n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         Hello? Ray?\n\n\n               Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He \n               gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive \n               to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to \n               see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly \n               does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing \n               it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.\n\n \n               Walking back into the kitchen...\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.\n\n \n                         \n               Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He \n               shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over \n               at the force Ray used.\n\n \n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         (questioning) What?

Hastily grabbing the package, he \n               realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         Can you do that for me, darling?\n\n\n               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - EVENING\n\n\n               Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs. \n               He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains \n               a hand gun.

They become louder \n               and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy \n               of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets \n               Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash \n               is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to \n               Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening \n               starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting \n               lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought \n               the stairs.\n\n \n               A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his \n               breathing becomes more erratic.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Is the lighting back?\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         No, this is something else...\n\n\n               Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine \n               begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. \n               Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up \n               to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves \n               everywhere. \n\n \n               A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even \n               louder. \n\n \n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         (screams) AHHHH...

WAIT!! \n\n\n               Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through \n               the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first \n               door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, \n               after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of \n               the furnace room. \n\n \n               The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, \n               you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around \n               them. \n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Are we still alive?\n\n\n               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN\n\n\n               Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding \n               on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges \n               it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. \n\n \n               He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping \n               against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in \n               pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds \n               most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top \n               floor because the second floor was completely torn off. \n\n \n               The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane \n               engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the \n               remains of different sections of an airplane. \n\n \n               EXT.

They \n               are all soaked from the rain. \n\n \n               They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and \n               off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots \n               are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his \n               hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain \n               as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around \n               to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One \n               more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite \n               his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. \n               The van drives away.\n\n \n               Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what \n               to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has \n               none.\n\n \n               Walking Down the Street - Dusk\n\n\n               They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their \n               stories of assumption. One man says... \"Europe's got it the worst....\" \n               while another man says \"We've got it the worst......\" while some \n               people \"don't give a shit who it is.....\"\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Looks like the power's still on here.\n\n \n                         \n                                     RAY\n\n                         Yeah, power's still on because nothing \n                         bad has come up from under the ground.\n\n \n                         \n               A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and \n               lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just \n               like cars. They wait. \n\n \n               A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter \n               with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, \n               as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars \n               go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue \n               walking.\n\n \n               EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK\n\n\n               Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people \n               are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank \n               woman says over a megaphone... \n\n \n                                     WOMAN\n\n                         Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative, \n                         thank you but we already have more blood \n                         than we can use.

Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he \n               realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel \n               wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray \n               looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's \n               last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people. \n               It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody. \n               The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the \n               ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the \n               ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow. \n\n \n                                     CAPTAIN\n\n                         CAST OFF!!!

We're taking the ramp up.\n\n \n                         \n               The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for \n               quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start \n               to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch \n               on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd \n               of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so \n               far are withstanding. \n\n \n               Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to \n               let him and his family through.

Soldiers shove empty cars off the \n               ramp. \n\n \n               Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's \n               jacket. \n\n \n                                     SHERYL\n\n                         Oh, Ray!!

WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are \n               tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow \n               as it falls on the ship.

Robbie is already running \n               towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. \n               Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for \n               them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly \n               pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding \n               on to Robbie's back, also going down.\n\n \n               The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. \n               \n\n \n               As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed \n               into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs \n               in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie \n               out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind \n               and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they \n               meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away \n               from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and \n               pulling them into the robot's holds. \n\n \n               EXT.

In the distance \n               they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the \n               water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people \n               off the streets. Many people scream. \n\n \n               With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside \n               on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look \n               there with her. \n\n \n               THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people \n               with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, \n               in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, \n               and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat \n               down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill \n               to join the three. \n\n \n               Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as \n               we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing \n               falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods \n               where clothes fall like snow. \n\n \n               Pasture Fence Line - Dark\n\n\n               Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line \n               of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 \n               yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins \n               walking faster toward the gunfire.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Robbie, slow down.\n\n\n               Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.\n\n\n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Robbie, slow down!!!\n\n\n               Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling \n               down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into \n               a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up. \n               \n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Robbie.\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.\n\n \n                         \n               Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!\n\n\n               Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their \n               heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         GET BACK HERE!!!\n\n\n               Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have \n               now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can \n               to try to stay with Robbie.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!\n\n \n                         \n               Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel \n               are now searching for him.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         ROBBIE!!!

ROBBIE!!!\n\n\n               Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back \n               by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie \n               fights to get back up.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???\n\n\n               Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over \n               the hill. Radio people are telling their officers \"no effect \n               on target\". \n\n \n               Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get \n               his attention on him.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU \n                         TO LISTEN TO ME!\n\n \n               Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over \n               the hill. \n\n \n               Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips \n               him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he \n               did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of \n               him, pining him down to the ground. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         LISTEN TO ME! \n\n\n               Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over \n               the hill. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         DON'T DO THIS!

They think she's alone so they \n               try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!

For \n               a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         Just listen to me!\n\n\n                                     ROBBIE\n\n                         I need to be here!

You need to let me \n                         go.\n\n \n               Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. \n               Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. \n               Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough \n               trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. \n               \n\n \n               Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at \n               each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. \n               Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         GET OFF!!!

Ray looks at the hill \n               where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls \n               over the hill. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         Robbie?!?!\n\n\n               Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! \n               A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion \n               blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. \n\n \n               \n                                     RAY\n\n\n                         ROBBIE!!!\n\n\n               By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. \n               A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the \n               hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three \n               robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being \n               fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery. \n               \n\n \n               EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT\n\n\n               Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away \n               from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle \n               as a signal for anybody who can see him.\n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         Over here! OVER HERE!!!\n\n\n               Ray and Rachel run towards him. \n\n\n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         Hurry!!\n\n\n               The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run \n               into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar \n               doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. \n               Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door. \n\n \n               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS \n\n\n               Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks \n               at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the \n               clothes he wears. \n\n \n               Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and \n               Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes. \n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         (to Rachel) You all right?\n\n\n               Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock. \n\n\n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         (to Ray) And what about you?\n\n\n               Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard \n               muttering \"Robbie\" very quietly.\n\n \n               Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about \n               on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill \n               that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         (while Harland moves the wheel barrel) \n                         (to Rachel) There you go.

Come on, take a look. \n                         \n\n \n               Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out \n               of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.\n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         Somehow they killed a few of these things \n                         in Osaka.

We'll take 'em by surprise. \n                         \n\n \n               Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying \n               with an insane man. \n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         We're right under their feet, Ray. Right \n                         here, under their feet. \n\n \n               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK\n\n\n               Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. \n               He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines \n               it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming \n               in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall \n               and studies that one. \n\n \n               Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over \n               the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board \n               hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.\n\n \n               \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         You miss your mommy?

If you want to talk \n                         to somebody, or ask somebody a question, \n                         you ask me!\n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         (also angry at Ray) What exactly is \n                         your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna \n                         do. How about you? You gonna sit here, \n                         wait for them to come get you? Is that \n                         your plan?\n\n \n               Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing \n               miscellaneous things. \n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         Maybe you want to get caught.

Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll \n                         train you as their pet.

Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye \n               opens and lights turn on for it. \n\n \n               Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. \n               Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It \n               sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and \n               Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with \n               her. \n\n \n               The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs \n               an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head \n               no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince \n               him not to. \n\n \n               Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost \n               makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers \n               which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward \n               the noise. They run to a different spot.\n\n \n               Robot gets closer...\n\n\n               Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot \n               into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and \n               sees nothing. \n\n \n               It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. \n               The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind \n               the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and \n               Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief \n               comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.\n\n \n               Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the \n               lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. \n               They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout \n               the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts \n               of the basement.\n\n \n               Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens \n               but the gun is pulled back by Ray.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         (dead silent) Give me that!\n\n\n               Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both \n               have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. \n\n \n               \n               Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. \n               Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces \n               him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.\n\n \n               \n               The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. \n               \n\n \n               Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just \n               as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens \n               scurry out through the open hole.\n\n \n               Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....\n\n \n               \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         You and I... I don't  think we are on \n                         the same page. \n\n \n               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY\n\n\n               The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along \n               the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red \n               mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the \n               mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts \n               his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. \n               \n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         RAY!!!

Ray watches a man \n               being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes \n               down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray \n               has a horrified look on his face. \n\n \n                                     HARLAND\n\n                         (repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My \n                         Blood!!!\n\n \n               Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling. \n               Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland \n               who is digging some sort of hole. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         Stop it! Stop it!

RACHEL!!!\n\n\n               A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough \n               to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes \n               after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, \n               grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times. \n               \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         (screams) AHH!\n\n\n               Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He \n               looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill. \n\n \n               The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. \n               Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it. \n\n \n               \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!!\n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         NO NO NO!!!\n\n\n               The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the \n               foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. \n               He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.\n\n \n               \n                                     RAY\n\n                         HEY!!!\n\n\n               It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. \n               It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw. \n               \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         (screams in pain) AHHH!\n\n\n               He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as \n               well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera \n               shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion. \n               Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.\n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         RACHEL!!\n\n\n               He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound \n               and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls \n               down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the \n               ship. The same happens in the other cage. \n\n \n                                     RAY\n\n                         (reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response) \n                         Rachel.\n\n \n               She seems to be frozen. \n\n\n                                     RAY\n\n                         Rachel.\n\n\n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         Dad?\n\n\n               Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all \n               the people around and the door opens to take another person up. \n               Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing \n               claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go \n               with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's \n               hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this \n               and latches onto Ray's arm. \n\n \n                                     SOLDIER 2\n\n                         Pull me! Pull me!!!\n\n\n               People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving \n               him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. \n\n \n               \n                                     SOLDIER 2\n\n                         We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!\n\n \n                         \n               Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the \n               cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is \n               seen by the soldier. \n\n \n                                     SOLDIER 2\n\n                         EVERYBODY DOWN!!!\n\n\n               Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. \n               We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors \n               and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages \n               and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb \n               out. \n\n \n               Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a \n               way that meant how did you do that.\n\n \n               Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day\n\n\n               Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering \n               them to \"keep moving.\" The crows are now eating the red plant \n               which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of \n               dead plant.\n\n \n                                     RACHEL\n\n                         What happened to it?\n\n\n               Ray crumples the plant in his hand.

Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense \n               if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be \n               heard telling everyone \"calm down and get in the tunnel\".\n\n \n               \n               Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. \n               The robot's shields are down.

The factory explodes and the robot grinds to \n               a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls \n               out of the door.
