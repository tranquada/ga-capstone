STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY\n\nEnd of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of\nLos Angeles.\n\nEXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY\nThe armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges\nfrom the back with a satchel and heads inside.\n\n\nINT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION\nA large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS\ncan be heard from a second floor balcony.\nDOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing\nthe Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and\ndials. Beat. Into phone --\n                         DOUGLAS\n           Last delivery's finally here.\nThe Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As\nhe and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard\nreferences the sounds from upstairs --\n                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD\n           Party?\n                         DOUGLAS\n           Introducing a new line of jewelry.\n                         ARMORED TRUCK GUARD\n           Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.\n           Told her to spend a little time with\n           the family jewels first.\nPING.

At one end of\nthe room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to\na walk-in vault.\n\nThe ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges\nwith the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of\nthe vault.\nA man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading\nthe cart into the vault.\n\nINT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY\n\nA train arrives.   People jostle on and off.\nOne man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.\nCarrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap\nover his shoulder.\nThe train doors begin to close.   When...\nA fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and\na man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.\nIntense.\nFait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They\ncheck to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the\nplatform into the tunnel and disappear.\n\nINT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY\nThe man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He\ncloses the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the\ndoor, securing the vault.\n\nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY\nFait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to\nthe wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-\nvoltage third rail.\nOut of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.\nJust before he hits. Inches from the rail.

JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY\nSounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security\nstation, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and\nscans the security monitors.\n\nANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS\ndepicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various\nempty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man\nin the suit riding up.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\nDouglas settles back in with his magazine.\n\nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY\nFait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait\nstarts to open it.\nSuddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an\nAPPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press\ntheir backs against it as tightly as they can.\nThe TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's\ngone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.\n\nINT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY\nFait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts\nand rights, following more spray paint.\nThey branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the\nsub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a\nflat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-\npainted circle.\n                           FAIT\n          Bull's-eye.\nWithout a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.

SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nSu's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through\nHEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,\njust STATIC.\nSuddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even\nmore alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the\nphone.\n                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)\n           Yes?\n\n                         FAIT (V.O.)\n           We're in position.\n                         CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)\n           Delivery confirmed.

And\ntakes off.\n\nEXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\nPerched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to\nthe park. The top floor is at street level.\nSu easily gains access to the roof of the building. He\nmoves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's\nan eight-story drop.\nSu faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.\nFalling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs\nonto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then\nlets go.\nMomentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a\nsixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto\nthe balcony.\n\n\nINT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n                                                                    6.\nA large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away.

Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-\nslap.\n                            CHRISTOPHE\n           I'll tell you.\n                            SU\n           I know.\n\nINT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY\nA plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab\noverhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.\nFait hammers at the last layer. And...\n\nINT.

JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY\nA uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the\nback and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a\nshort, tight dress emerges.\n\nINT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY\n\nEscorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She\napproaches the security station. Up close, in the light,\nDaria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.\n                        DARIA\n          I'm here for the reception.\n                          DOUGLAS\n          Name, please?\n                          DARIA\n          Angie Rawlins.\nDouglas scans a list of names.

Just\nglances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.\n                        DARIA\n          ... I hate these things.      Don't you\n          hate these things?\n                        DOUGLAS\n          I'm just here to do my job.\nDaria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking\nwhat she sees.\n                        DARIA\n          Then again, you never know who you're\n          going to meet...\nShe shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the\ndesk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.\n                          DARIA\n\n                                                               8.\n          I'll bet you're a lot more fun than\n          any of those boring people upstairs.\nDouglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.\n                         DOUGLAS\n          Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.\nDaria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.\nThen she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.\n\nDARIA'S POV\nThe magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big\npecs, big penises.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\nDaria steps back.\n                        DARIA\n          Well, I suppose I should go up and\n          see what they're selling.\nDaria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.\n                         DARIA\n          Tommy...\nWhat happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as\nDaria walks toward Tommy:\nShe whispers into a hidden mike --\n                        DARIA\n          Change of plans. He's gay.\nTommy hears it over his earwig.\n                         TOMMY\n          No way.\n                         DARIA\n          Yeah way.\nINTERCUT WITH:\n\nINT.

I\n          shouldn't be too long.\nDaria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.\nThen heads toward the elevator, as...\nTommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to\nlook flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans\nover the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.\n                         TOMMY\n          ...

Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.\nNever taking his eyes off Ling. When...\nSona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly\ntakes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns\nthe gun on Su.\nSu dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd\njust been standing.

To Archie and   Tommy, as he\nsignals --\n                        SU\n          Don't let him get away!\n\nAs a result of which...\n\nTOMMY AND ARCHIE\nHaving just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50\nis out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine\ngun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING\naway.\n\n\nLIMO\nLing's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH\nHOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as\nthe TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.\nINTERCUT WITH which...\n\nSU AND SONA\nPlay cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.\nHe can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the\ninevitable. When...\nWHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from\nSona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed\nlimo\n                          DARIA\n          Get him.\nSu goes after Ling.\nAnd now it's Daria vs. Sona.\nSona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her\nside. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the\nScorpion. She swings it up. And...\nDaria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes\nSona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the\nSCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips\nthrough her chest and kills her.\nAnd now, here's what's been going on outside...\n\nEXT. AIRFIELD\n\n                                                                91.\n\nAs Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the\ntarmac into the darkness of the airfield...\n\nMILES\n\nflips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.

Until...\nCharles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all\nthe way. He whips it open. And...\nThere's Vanessa, hiding inside.\nCharles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.\n                        CHARLES\n          Time to end this my way.\nAnd then...\n                        FAIT (O.S.)\n          Drop the girl.\n\n                                                              92.\n\nCharles looks over.

He releases her.\n                          VANESSA\n          Daddy!\nVanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a\nlittle more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...\n\nSuddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind\nher. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.\nCharles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.\nFait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait\nstays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little\ngirl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly\nunstoppable force.\nThe fight winds through the planes, under wings, through\nstruts.\n\nSNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION\nFait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.\n\nMILES\ncomms Fait.\n                          MILES\n          No shot.\n\nFAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA\nThe fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal\nattack. When...\nVanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.\nCharles moves in. And...\nFait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's\nwheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by\na length of nylon rope.\nFait turns to Vanessa.\n\n                                                            93.\n                         FAIT\n          Don't move.\nFait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite\nlike nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of\nFait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat\nthe living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight\nback, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.\nThe punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...\nA mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is\nunconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over\nCharles. Tosses the chocks down.\n                          FAIT\n          Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.\n\nFait turns.

Four helicopters take off, one after the\nother, carrying the buyers away.\nThe fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting\nfor the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a\nbodyguard.\nLing intercepts them.

AGUSTA - COCKPIT\nThe pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from\ncrashing.\n\nEXT. AIRFIELD\nThe out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the\nhangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,\nripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it\ncaroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle\naround Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING\nINTO FLAMES.\nThe spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With\nSu in the middle.\nThe Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the\ncircle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.\nInto the circle.

You\n          Won't be lucky again.\nThe final fight begins.\nThe two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,\nusing everything they can lay their hands on. Each the\nequal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.\nFor a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...\nLing gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes\nand flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.\n                        LING\n          I'll kill you fast.    You won't\n          Feel a thing.\n\n                          SU\n          ... I won't.

Just as... Su pulls the ceramic\nCapsule containing the activated sliver of stone from\nLing's pocket. And...\nSlams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,\nchoking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-\nstricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.\nThen, in SUBTITLED Chinese --\n                        SU\n          This is for our friends.\nAnd Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand\nblow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...\n\nINSIDE LING'S THROAT\nThe CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing\nwhite sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's\nsuper high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook\nLing's body from within.

Horribly desiccated. His seared and\ndarkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his\nskeleton. Human jerky.\nIn a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains\ntopple over. Su has closed a chapter.\n\nSAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER\nSu and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's\nholding Vanessa, asleep in his arms.
