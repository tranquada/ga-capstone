Fait cracks the access door.\n\n<b>INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY\n</b>Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts\nand rights, following more spray paint.\nThey branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the\nsub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a\nflat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-\npainted circle.\n<b>                           FAIT\n</b>          Bull's-eye.\nWithout a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.

Only there's no music,\njust STATIC.\nSuddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even\nmore alert.

The top floor is at street level.\nSu easily gains access to the roof of the building. He\nmoves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's\nan eight-story drop.\nSu faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.\nFalling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs\nonto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then\nlets go.\nMomentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go.
