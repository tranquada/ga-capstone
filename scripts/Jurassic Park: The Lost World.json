TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY\n</b>\n\tA 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a \n\ttropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white\n\tsand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tISLA SORNA\n</b>\t\t87 miles southeast of Nublar\n\n\tTwo SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a\n\tpicnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully\n\tlaying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal\n\tdecanters with red and white wine.\n\n\tPAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,\n\treading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually\n\tsurprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than\n\tonce, supervises the settings of the table.\n\n\tShe looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight\n\tyears old, wandering off down the beach.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS.

You can look for\n\t\tshells right here!\n\n\tCathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOWMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(eyes still in his book)\n\t\tLeave her alone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS. BOWMAN\n</b>\t\tWhat about snakes?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOWMAN\n</b>\t\tThere's no snakes on a beach.  Let\n\t\ther have fun, for once.\n\n<b>\tFURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,\n</b>\n\tCathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her\n\tparents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHY\n</b>\t\tPlease be quiet, please be quiet\n\t\tplease be quiet...\n\n\tRounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view\n\tbehind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she\n\tturns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the\n\tsand.\n\n\tA large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches\n\tswaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,\n\twhich abruptly stops moving.\n\n\tA small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes\n\talong its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot\n\ttall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.\n\tIt walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHY\n</b>\t\tWell, hello there!\n\n\tThe animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats\n\tdown on her haunches.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY (cont'd)\n\t\tWhat are you?  A little bird or\n\t\tsomething?\n\n\tShe opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY (cont'd)\n\t\tAre you hungry?  You want a goldfish?\n\n\tThe compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY (cont'd)\n\t\tCome on.  I won't hurt you.\n\n\tThe compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm\n\tof her hand.  The compy gets closer still --\n\n\t-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit\n\tunder the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up\n\teasily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats\n\tit.\n\n\tEnchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her\n\thand, calling back over her shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY (cont'd)\n\t\tMom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!\n\t\tI found something!\n\n\tShe turns back.\n\n\tThirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're\n\tstanding there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few\n\tfeet away.  Cathy's smile fades.\n\n\tShe turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS\n\thave come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing\n\tand CHIPPING as they surround her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY (cont'd)\n\t\t\t(terrified)\n\t\tWhat do you guys want?\n\n<b>\tBACK ON THE BEACH,\n</b>\n\tthe table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS. BOWMAN\n</b>\t\tCathy, sweetheart!

We don't see what she sees, but we hear the\n\tfrenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the\n\tHands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a\n\thorrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. BOARD ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tMrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the\n\tYAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER\n\tEXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a\n\tmonied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over\n\tsixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their\n\tlawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their\n\tears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table\n\thint that everyone's been here a long time.\n\n\tA familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move\n\tdown the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tThe hurricane seemed like a disaster\n\t\tat the time, but now I think it was a\n\t\tblessing, nature's way of freeing\n\t\tthose animals from their human\n\t\tconfines.  Of giving them another\n\t\tchance to survive, but this time as\n\t\tthey were meant to, without man's\n\t\tinterference.\n\n\tThe source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen\n\tand creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His\n\timage is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled\n\tup to the end of the table.\n\n\tAnd he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up\n\tin bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING\n\taround him.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAMMOND (cont'd)\n\t\tThere are some corporate issues that\n\t\tare not about the bottom line.  We\n\t\thave so much still to learn about\n\t\tthose creatures.  A whole world of\n\t\tintricate, interlocking behaviors,\n\t\tvanished everywhere -- except for\n\t\tSite B. Please.  Let's not do what\n\t\tis good for more men at the expense\n\t\tat what is best for all mankind.\n\n\tThe CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHAIRMAN\n</b>\t\tThank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?\n\n\tHe turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the\n\tanxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.\n\tLudlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white\n\teight by tens, and tosses them on the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\t\t(an accent similar to\n\t\t\t Hammond's)\n\t\tThese pictures were taken in a\n\t\thospital in Costa Rica forty-eight\n\t\thours ago, after an American family\n\t\ton a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site\n\t\tB.  The little girl will be fine, but\n\t\ther parents are wealthy, angry, and\n\t\tvery fond of lawsuits.  But that's\n\t\thardly new to us, is it?\n\t\t\t(takes a paper from the\n\t\t\t file)\n\t\tWrongful death settlements, partial\n\t\tlist:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5\n\t\tmillion dollars; family of Robert\n\t\tMuldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or\n\t\tdestroyed equipment, 17.3 million.\n\t\tDemolition, de-construction, and\n\t\tdisposal of Isla Nublar facilities,\n\t\torganic and inorganic, one hundred\n\t\tand twenty-six million dollars.  The\n\t\tlist goes on, gentlemen -- research\n\t\tfunding, media payoffs.  Silence is\n\t\texpensive.\n\n\tHe's warming up.  Not a bad performer.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUDLOW (cont'd)\n\t\tThis corporation has been bleeding\n\t\tfrom the throat for four years.  You,\n\t\tour board of directors, have set\n\t\tpatiently and listened to ecology\n\t\tlectures while Mr. Hammond signed\n\t\tyour checks and spent your money.\n\t\tYou have watched your stock drop from\n\t\tseventy-eight and a quarter to\n\t\tnineteen flat with no good and in\n\t\tsight.  And all along, we have held a\n\t\tsignificant product asset that we\n\t\tcould have safely harvested and\n\t\tdisplayed for profit.  Enormous\n\t\tprofit.\n\n\tHe reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,\n\tsending it sliding down the length of the table in front of\n\tthem.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny\n\treplicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops\n\tand Tourists look on in wonder.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUDLOW (cont'd)\n\t\tEnough money to wipe out four years\n\t\tof lawsuits and damage control and\n\t\tunpleasant infighting, enough to not\n\t\tonly send our stock back to where it\n\t\twas but to double it.  And the one\n\t\tthing, the only thing standing\n\t\tbetween us and this asset is a\n\t\tborn-again naturalist who happens to\n\t\tbe our own CEO.  Well, I don't work\n\t\tfor Mother Nature.  I work for you.\n\n\tTwo of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.\n\tLudlow takes one and reads from it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUDLOW (cont'd)\n\t\t\"Whereas the Chief Executive\n\t\tOfficer has engaged in wasteful and\n\t\tnegligent business practices to\n\t\tfurther his own personal\n\t\tenvironmental beliefs --\n\t\tWhereas these practices have \n\t\taffected the financial performance\n\t\tof the company by incurring\n\t\tsignificant losses --\n\t\tWhereas the shareholders have been\n\t\tmaterially harmed by these losses --\n\t\tThereby, be it resolved that John\n\t\tParker Hammond should be resolved from\n\t\tthe office of Chief Executive\n\t\tOfficer, affective immediately.\"  Mr.\n\t\tChairman, I move the resolution be\n\t\tput to an immediate vote.  Do I have\n\t\ta second?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOARD MEMBER\n</b>\t\tI second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,\n\t\tPlease poll the members by a show of\n\t\thands.\n\n\tThe CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't\n\tbear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHAIRMAN\n</b>\t\tAll those in favor of InGen Corporate\n\t\tResolution 213C, please signify your\n\t\tapproval by raising your right hand.\n\n\tIt starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes\n\tup.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises\n\this right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at\n\tthe TV screen.  It goes blank.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tSparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle\n\tof a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.\n\tSomewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.\n\n\tThe WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big\n\tbarrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot\n\tand grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette\n\tdangling from his lips.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIETER\n</b>\t\tYeah.\n\n\tHe takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He\n\tsmiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b><b>\tINT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tSmoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station\n\tunderneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some\n\tCOMMUTERS and suck up a few more.\n\n\tA tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving\n\tas fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just\n\tbefore they meet --\n\n\t-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man\n\tis IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.\n\tThere's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been\n\tthere's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he\n\tdoesn't care.\n\n<b>\tINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tMALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.\n\tHe looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN\n\tacross from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The\n\tCurious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and\n\tapproaches.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\t\t(under his breath)\n\t\tShit.\n\n\tThe Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tYou're him, aren't you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\tExcuse me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tThe guy.

I never\n\t\tsaid I was in any such place.\n\n\tHe gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the\n\tCurious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS\n\tacross from him are staring at him.\n\n\tHe looks at them.  They looks away.\n\n\tHe pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.

It\n\tlunges --\n\n\t-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.\n\tThe dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The\n\tButler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tBUTLER\n</b>\t\tNot an animal lover?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\tNot really.\n\n<b>\tINT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tMALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the\n\tbed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;\n\n\tMedical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among\n\tthe furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells\n\tus that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAMMOND\n</b>\t\tIan!

Not\n\t\ttheir lives as man would have them,\n\t\tbehind electric fences, but in the\n\t\twild.  Behavior in their natural\n\t\thabitat, the impossible dream of any\n\t\tpaleontologist.

If you convince her\n\t\tto go, it'll be a major coup.

But someone steps in\n\tfront of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the\n\thunter from the bar in Mombassa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b>\t\tCancel that, Dieter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\tWhat?

DIETER\n\tSTARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the\n\t\"speedbird,\" waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at\n\tthe wheel beside him.\n\n\tLUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR.

They\n\tlook up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car\n\tstops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.\n\n\tIn the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in\n\tfront of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks\n\taround the front of the car and sees --\n\n\t-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the\n\tjungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set\n\tanimals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,\n\ta tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their\n\theads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at\n\tLudlow, who look at Dr. Burke.\n\n\tBurke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBURKE\n</b>\t\tPachycephalosaurus!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\tCarnivore?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBURKE\n</b>\t\t\t(enchanted)\n\t\tHuh?

The first pachy stares at it\n\tintently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --\n\n\t-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out\n\tof the way.\n\n\t\t\t\tBURKE (cont'd)\n\t\tSo when it lowers its head, its neck\n\t\tlines up directly with its\n\t\tbackbone --\n\n<b>\tBEHIND DIETER,\n</b>\n\tAjay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.

Dieter spins around, just in\n\ttime to see --\n\n\t-- the first pachy in full charge.

The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying\n\tagainst the car, knocking the wind out of him.\n\n\tIn the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean\n\tout the window for a better look, laughing.\n\n\tPOW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It\n\tbounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as\n\tDieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the\n\tspeedbird.\n\n\tBut the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's\n\tforced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the\n\tspeedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the\n\tvehicle.\n\n\tNow the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the\n\tDriver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the\n\tcar again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and\n\tMANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,\n\tvastly amused.\n\n<b>\tA FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,\n</b>\n\tAjay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an\n\tanimal footprint, three-toed, enormous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAJAY\n</b>\t\tIt matches the pictures.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b>\t\tIt certainly does.\n\n\tRoland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the\n\tpachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.\n\tRoland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --\n\n\t-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled\n\t.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in\n\timmaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,\n\tbisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.\n\n\tThe barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory\n\tbead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,\n\tbreaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his\n\tshirt pocket.\n\n\tFour inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,\n\tthese are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.\n\tHe slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.\n\n\tRoland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals\n\ttrashing the speedbird for the first time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b><b>\t\tHEY!\n</b>\n\tThe pachys all freeze, staring at him.

Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,\n\tcalling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.\n\n\t\t\t\tROLAND (cont'd)\n\t\tDon't worry about us.

As it moves ahead, it reveals\n\tDIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.\n\n<b>\tIN THE JUNGLE,\n</b>\n\tAjay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree\n\tangle away from the direction in which the animals tracks\n\tlead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b>\t\tAjay.\n\n\tAjay turns.

That's good.\n\n\tHe proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They\n\tcan see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a\n\tblack interior.\n\n\tRoland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he\n\tsees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,\n\tcrawling with white maggots and flies.\n\n\tRoland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the\n\tskull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin\n\tstill adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.\n\n\tStill he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and\n\tthey edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd\n\tSQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.\n\n\tCrawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular\n\trampart of dried mud, and peer into --\n\n\t-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten\n\tfeet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.\n\n\tA BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the\n\tcenter of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and\n\tits body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a\n\tscraggly appearance.\n\n\tIt SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a\n\tchunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp\n\tteeth.\n\n\tThe cave itself is a foul boneyard.

The three of\n\tthem look at each other for a moment --\n\n\t-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the\n\ttrailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and\n\tstarts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.

Sarah,\n\tstarting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,\n\tgetting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety\n\tlatch, doesn't open.\n\n\tBelow Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.\n\tThrough the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five\n\thundred feet below.\n\n\tThe refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.

She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the\n\trear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.\n\n<b>\tFIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW,\n</b>\n\tan enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.

The adult tyrannosaur\n\tGURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.\n\n\tIn the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely\n\tvisible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,\n\ttrying to figure out what this thing is.\n\n\tIt rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and\n\tthen rises, straights up --\n\n\t-- taking the whole tent with it!

As he draws close, an enormous\n\tT-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep\n\tinto the mud.\n\n\tRoland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked\n\tHunters flee in all directions.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b><b>\t\tFOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!\n</b>\n\tBut they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed\n\tprey that pours across the campsite.

It\n\tturns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off\n\tafter them.\n\n\tMalcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland\n\tunceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.\n\n<b>\tIN THE RAVINE,\n</b>\n\tKelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,\n\thears her father screaming her name and looks up.

One rex grabs hold\n\tof a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.\n\n\tThe second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive\n\thead left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The\n\tHunter goes flying forward and crashes into --\n\n\t-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest\n\tof the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the\n\trex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the\n\tbottom of it --\n\n\t-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into\n\tthe earth.\n\n<b>\tUP ON TH ROCK FACE,\n</b>\n\tMalcolm is frantic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\tI gotta get down there!\n\n<b>\tDOWN IN THE RAVINE,\n</b>\n\tit's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick\n\tknows it.

They squeeze\n\tas far back against the wall as they can get.\n\n\tThe rex can't quite get its head all the way through the\n\topening --\n\n\t-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers\n\tout of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around\n\tthem, to pull them out of the cave.\n\n\tBurke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the\n\tcave, which pushes Kelly further out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSARAH\n</b><b>\t\tSTOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP\n</b><b>\t\tIT!\n</b>\n\tBut Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for\n\thimself.

Up\n\ton the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his\n\tarms madly.\n\n\tBut in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.\n\tThey continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get\n\tfurther away from the tyrannosaurs.\n\n<b>\tABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY,\n</b>\n\tthe tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by\n\tthe full moon.

Now behind them, four\n\tmore heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.\n\n\tOn all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move\n\tforward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.\n\n\tAnd these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly\n\tdragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall\n\tgrass.\n\n\tIn his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal\n\tdrops its head to make the kill.\n\n\tBehind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more\n\tanimal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the\n\tRUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --\n\n\t-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.\n\n\tVelociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,\n\tthe second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved\n\tclaw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes\n\ton attack.\n\n\tLike now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the\n\tHunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The\n\tHunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish\n\tinto the twitching long grass.\n\n\tAnother raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,\n\tpast the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,\n\tand takes him down, into the grass.\n\n\tBehind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,\n\trealizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long\n\tgrass.\n\n\tAround him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.\n\n\tAjay simply closes his eyes.\n\n<b>\tUP ON THE ROCK,\n</b>\n\tRoland turns away from the carnage, pained.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.

Roland bends\n\tdown, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he\n\tsaw earlier.\n\n\tA set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the\n\tcarcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow\n\tfollows Roland.\n\n\tAs they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the\n\tsurface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,\n\twashing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with\n\this eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the\n\tsound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.\n\n\tHe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes\n\tfrom the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases\n\tthat on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,\n\tthen blow back at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\tWe're downwind.  Good.\n\n\tRoland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to\n\this lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the\n\tshore.  Ludlow follows.\n\n\tThey creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend\n\tand Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.\n\n\tOver the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards\n\tahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a\n\tbird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,\n\tto let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at\n\tthe water as well, drinking.\n\n\tRoland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to \"off.\"\n\n\tLudlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he\n\tputs his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the\n\tmiddle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,\n\teyes blazing.\n\n\tOut in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as\n\twell, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since\n\tRoland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's\n\treaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.\n\n\tRoland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.\n\n<b>\tFURTHER ON,\n</b>\n\tthe trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.\n\tRoland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.\n\tRoland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.\n\n\tTo the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.\n\tA short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,\n\tgreen, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and\n\tWHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b>\t\tWe took to the rock.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\tWhy?\n\n\tIn front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night\n\tbreeze.

Very slowly and almost\n\tsilently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it\n\tis staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.\n\n\tRoland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,\n\tunaware of its presence.\n\n\tUntil it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite\n\taudible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks\n\tever so slightly.\n\n\tTheir hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his\n\tvoice a queasy HISS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUDLOW\n</b>\t\tIt's... behind... us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROLAND\n</b>\t\t\t(the very softest whisper)\n\t\tIt's just fed.

A few strands of Ludlow's\n\thair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.\n\n\tHe can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon\n\the holds in his hands.

They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight\n\tup into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so\n\tit is firmly around his midsection.\n\n\tThe whole combination of movements takes but half a second.\n\tBy the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and\n\tdarted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING\n\tand writhing in its mouth.\n\n\tRoland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but\n\tthrough the shivering trees, he can only see that the\n\ttyrannosaur is gone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT.

Still on top of the kilm house, she\n\treaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof\n\tof the next building.\n\n\tShe lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of\n\tsloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --\n\n\t-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full\n\tstride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof\n\tahead of her.\n\n\tSarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,\n\taway from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her\n\tSPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section\n\tpulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to\n\tit, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.\n\n\tShe looks over her shoulder, down --\n\n\t-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the\n\tbuilding below.\n\n\tSarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which\n\tkeeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in\n\ttime to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.\n\n\tSarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and\n\tnails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all\n\tthe way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles\n\tthere, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.\n\n\tThe raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,\n\tat her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its\n\tjumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.\n\n\tDesperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof\n\tand hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the\n\thead, for all the good that does.\n\n\tBut Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She\n\tedges to the right, toward a fresh supply.\n\n\tThe raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the\n\tslick roof.\n\n\tSomething interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose\n\ttiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.\n\tSarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the\n\tway as fast as she can.\n\n\tSuddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the\n\tfooting underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The\n\tanimal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid\n\tthe tumbling tiles.\n\n\tSarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,\n\thugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the\n\troof, right past her --\n\n\t-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and\n\tattack one another.\n\n\tNow Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next\n\tto the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.\n\tShe GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue\n\tto thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out\n\tof their way --\n\n\t-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.\n\n<b>\tINT. LAB - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tSarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and\n\tlands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent\n\tlight fixture.\n\n\tOne end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45\n\tdegree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES\n\tthrough a window.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

Above her, she can\n\tsee NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.\n\n\tSarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the\n\thelicopter building, and starts to climb it.\n\n<b>\tELSEWHERE IN THE STREET,\n</b>\n\tKELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the\n\tdistance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling\n\twith fear, unable to move.\n\n\tThe whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it\n\toutside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror\n\tis so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands\n\tin self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the\n\tentire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she\n\tlooks up --\n\n\t-- into her father's eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKELLY\n</b>\t\tDad!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\tCome on!\n\n\tHe grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.\n\n<b>\tON THE ROOFTOP,\n</b>\n\tSarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and\n\tleaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tWhere's Kelly?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSARAH\n</b>\t\tWhere's Ian?\n\n\tEyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the\n\tstreet below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top\n\tspeed down the middle of the street --\n\n<b>\t-- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM.\n</b>\n<b>\tDOWN IN THE STREET,\n</b>\n\tMalcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.\n\tThey're pretty fast, but it's faster.\n\n\tAbove them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,\n\tSHOUTING and urging them on.

It pulls itself up.\n\n\tHigher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.\n\tShe breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs\n\ton a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,\n\trunning the balance beam.\n\n\tShe reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and\n\tlooks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,\n\tbreathing hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKELLY\n</b><b>\t\tDAD, COME ON!\n</b>\n\tBelow him, the raptor closes in.

He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,\n\tknocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off\n\tthe bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.\n\n\tHe drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to\n\ta halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably\n\tcracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELLY (cont'd)\n<b>\t\tDAD!\n</b>\n\tShe stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among\n\tthe bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six\n\tfeet above him now, with an open attack route.\n\n\tThe animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.\n\n\tUp above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans\n\tand leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.\n\n\tThe raptor springs.\n\n\tKelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very\n\tpeak of her trajectory, she lets go.\n\n\tThe raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING\n\tboth of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it\n\thurtling into space.\n\n\tShe lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery\n\tscaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the\n\tground below.

It's only ten feet away, then five,\n\tthey're surely done for this time, when --\n\n<b>\t-- KA-BOOM!\n</b>\n\tThere comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,\n\tand the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across\n\tthe roof, dead.
