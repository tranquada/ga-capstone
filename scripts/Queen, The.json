Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is\n          happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying.\n          W\n           e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket\n          pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes.\n          Gradually, she composes herself.\n          \n          That's better.\n          \n           on't want to make a fuss.\n          \n           he GILLIES will be here soon.\n          \n          The QUEEN takes a deep breath.

The STAG takes a last look\n          at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and\n          walks off.\n          \n           o sooner has he disappeared into the woods, than..\n          \n          Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and\n          GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in\n          greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety..\n          \n          The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to\n          make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself.\n          \n           e's vanished.
