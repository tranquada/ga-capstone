Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among\r\n          them, are on lunch duty.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ANGLE ON\r\n</b>          GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal.

Amy races over to\r\n          Tristan and writes him up.\r\n          Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes\r\n          open.

Because it's really tough for\r\n          me as head lunch monitor -- or another\r\n          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to\r\n          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I\r\n          know it's a lot to take in.
