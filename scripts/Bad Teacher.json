TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.\r\n          TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for\r\n          position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:\r\n          female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)\r\n          PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.\r\n          He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.\r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Well, it's been another great year here\r\n          at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'\r\n          haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.\r\n          SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly\r\n          enjoying the small compliment.\r\n\r\n                         SANDY\r\n          I ain't afraid of no ghost.\r\n          The other teachers laugh.\r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Or the wild success of...\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.C.)\r\n          Wally, can I just say one quick thing?\r\n          Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and\r\n          wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is\r\n          wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students\r\n          and adults alike -- like students.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Just wanted to remind everyone the school\r\n          day's not over. So let's keep the\r\n          drinking under control, hmm? That's it.\r\n          Back to you, Wally.\r\n          A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Thanks, Amy,\r\n          (then, back to his notes)\r\n          . Or the wild success of the book drive\r\n          for the women's prison sponsored by Ms.\r\n          Savicki's class?\r\n          A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS.

She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses\r\n          slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.\r\n\r\n          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)\r\n          You've only been with us for one short\r\n          year, but know that you'll always be a\r\n          part of the JAMS family.\r\n          Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.\r\n          The Teachers lightly applaud.\r\n\r\n          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)\r\n          And we got you a little something.\r\n          Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.\r\n          pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Almost forty dollars. Thank you!\r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Why don't you say a couple words?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this\r\n          type of thing so I'll make it quick. I\r\n          know I've only been here a year, but\r\n          there's so much I'm going to miss...\r\n\r\n          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing\r\n          the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (V.0.)\r\n          My students, probably most of all.I'm not\r\n          saying they were little angels, butthey\r\n          were all there to learn and that'sthe\r\n          greatest gift a student can give a teacher.\r\n          Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last\r\n          days of seventh grade.\r\n          A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with\r\n          his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who\r\n          considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she\r\n          signs it.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.\r\n          SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,\r\n          running toward their summer vacation.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (V.0.)\r\n          And I wish that I had gotten to know all of\r\n          you better, but between four classes and\r\n          planning a wedding, I had my hands full.\r\n          From the little I do know about you, I know\r\n          that our students are in good hands.\r\n          Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully\r\n          removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling\r\n          them into cardboard tubes.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY\r\n\r\n          Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a\r\n          thicket on the outskirts of the school property.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (V.0.)\r\n          And I can't believe it's all over. This\r\n          year flew by. And even though I'll never\r\n          teach again professionally, I've realized\r\n          that I don't need a blackboard and\r\n          classroom to set an example.\r\n          Elizabeth comes up behind them.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Hand it over.\r\n          The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of\r\n          the burnouts hands her the joint.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Everything.\r\n          The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with\r\n          a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          This was a warning. Next time, I don't\r\n          call the principal. I call the cops.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,\r\n          pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,\r\n          and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's\r\n          box out the window and extends her hand, giving the\r\n          school THE FINGER.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (O.S.)\r\n          Woo-hoo!\r\n          A couple students look at her strangely.\r\n\r\n                         ANGLE ON\r\n          The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.\r\n          He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of\r\n          Elizabeth is her message: \"YOU ARE ILLITERATE!\"\r\n\r\n                         DIM-LOOKING KID\r\n          (struggling to read)\r\n          You are... Illit... Illit...\r\n          Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly\r\n          hits him.\r\n          She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the\r\n          JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic\r\n          letters to read, \"HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!\"\r\n\r\n                         JANITOR\r\n          Slow down!\r\n\r\n          CHYRON: BAD TEACHER\r\n\r\n          EXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A Mercedes with the vanity plate \"HIS\" is parked in the\r\n          driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching\r\n          Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate\r\n          reads \"HERS.\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of\r\n          black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive.\r\n          Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING)\r\n          Baby Doll?\r\n\r\n          MARK (O.S.)\r\n          Coming!\r\n          MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.\r\n          He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and\r\n          is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.\r\n          Thankfully for him, he has money.\r\n\r\n                         MARK (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (ANXIOUS)\r\n          Hey! That was a quick party.\r\n          Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands\r\n          him a glass.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Yeah. You should have seen it. What a\r\n          joke.\r\n          She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Here's to me never having to work again.\r\n          And I owe it all to you, Lover.\r\n          Elizabeth takes a big sip.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (FLIRTATIOUS)\r\n          So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris,\r\n          and then I booked us a suite at the\r\n          Drake, and I thought we could finish the\r\n          night in \"anal alley.\" Hmm?\r\n          Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns\r\n          towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --\r\n\r\n          INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet,\r\n          behind the door.\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          See? Nothing.\r\n          Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.\r\n          Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only\r\n          in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,\r\n          revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         (TO MARK)\r\n          Motherfucker!\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          How could you do this to me?!\r\n          I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          You are buying me the biggest pair of\r\n          yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm\r\n          talking serious blood diamonds.\r\n          Sheila SNEEZES again.\r\n          Bless you.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         (TO SHEILA)\r\n          Get out of my house, bitch!\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          Don't talk to her like that.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Excuse me?\r\n          I love her.\r\n          Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's\r\n          large breasts.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          You love her?

I'm human. And this time\r\n          it was you. Maybe six months from now,\r\n          you'll walk in on me.

It's a pleasure to meet\r\n          you.\r\n          (handing over tupperware)\r\n          My mother baked these for you.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          (not looking up)\r\n          Just leave them on the desk.\r\n          Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there.\r\n          After a moment, Elizabeth looks up.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          You need something?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          16.\r\n          - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the\r\n          front of the class.\r\n\r\n                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Anyone here seen \"Stand and Deliver?\"\r\n          Show of hands.\r\n          (off their blank stares)\r\n          No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow.\r\n          Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two\r\n          KIDS in the front of the class.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          You and you, go grab the TV and roll it\r\n          up front.\r\n          (pointing to Sasha)\r\n          And you, go shut off the lights.\r\n          The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha\r\n          shuts off the LIGHTS.\r\n\r\n                         SASHA\r\n          We're watching a movie on the first day?\r\n\r\n                         CHASE\r\n\r\n                         (TO ELIZABETH)\r\n          I think it's awesome. You rock.\r\n\r\n                         GARRETT\r\n          I agree with Chase.\r\n          Elizabeth pops in the DVD. \"Stand and Deliver,\" starring\r\n          Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher\r\n          in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite\r\n          of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Ugh. Oatmeal raisin?\r\n          She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her\r\n          desk. Sasha looks on, sadly.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY\r\n\r\n          Lunch is in full swing. Each clique has staked its own\r\n          territory. Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among\r\n          them, are on lunch duty.\r\n\r\n                         ANGLE ON\r\n          GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan,\r\n          the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         TRISTAN\r\n          Incoming!\r\n          Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder.\r\n          Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and\r\n          eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to\r\n          Tristan and writes him up.\r\n          Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes\r\n          open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Did you see what just happened?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with\r\n          the cole slaw.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          You weren't at the orientation the other\r\n          day, but we're doing something new this\r\n          year. It's very exciting. We're\r\n          splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.\r\n          Elizabeth yawns.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          So, anyways, in order for the quadrant\r\n          system to work, it's vital that each\r\n          teacher maintain order within their\r\n          quadrant. Because it's really tough for\r\n          me as head lunch monitor -- or another\r\n          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to\r\n          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I\r\n          know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy\r\n          to sit with-you after school and explain\r\n          all of the new guidelines.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Tell you what. Why don't you send me a\r\n          memo, and if I have any questions, I'll\r\n          come to you.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan,\r\n          Stan.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          18.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO ELIZABETH)\r\n          Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that\r\n          you were showing a movie this morning?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          How do I know what you heard?\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to\r\n          tell you how to run your class, but maybe\r\n          it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.\r\n          Like \"Telephone Charades\" or \"The String\r\n          Game.\" Or start doing practice questions\r\n          for the state test. It's never too soon\r\n          to start.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that\r\n          impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I\r\n          was really hoping that we could be more\r\n          than across-the-hall-mates.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          I don't know what you've heard, but I\r\n          don't munch box.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          No, of course not. I don't even know\r\n          what that is. I just meant friends.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Like getting manicures and going shopping\r\n          on Sundays? Shit like that?\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Yes! Yes! And helping each other out.\r\n          Looking out for one another.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm\r\n          gonna get going. Cover for me?\r\n          Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n                         (NERVOUS)\r\n          But you can't leave.

Elizabeth looks around and spots the \"INTEGRITY\"\r\n          poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up\r\n          poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a\r\n          map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way.\r\n          Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She\r\n          turns on her heels.

Look, I\r\n          could take you day by day through my\r\n          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do\r\n          things. I'm not one of these stuffy\r\n          teachers who's totally by the book. I\r\n          talk to the kids like they're little\r\n          adults. It's about mutual respect.

From out in the hallway, we\r\n          HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan\r\n          runs to the door and peeks out.\r\n\r\n                         SPENCER\r\n          Whoa.

Cool.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Sit down.\r\n          Elizabeth races to the window.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH'S POV\r\n          The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next\r\n          to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook.\r\n\r\n                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n           (under her breath)\r\n          Balls.\r\n          She races back to her desk.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          66.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D\r\n          Keep reading.\r\n          Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,\r\n          obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook\r\n          and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we\r\n          SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.\r\n          Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her\r\n          mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her\r\n          way through the second and then the third, the chewing\r\n          becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.\r\n          Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police\r\n          Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by\r\n          Principal Snur and Amy.\r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This\r\n          will only take a second.\r\n          Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs\r\n          her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes\r\n          her mouth, breathes normally.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Sorry. I had something caught in my\r\n          throat.\r\n          The German Shepherd continues barking.\r\n\r\n                         POLICE OFFICER #1\r\n          What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?\r\n          The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go\r\n          wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,\r\n          almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.\r\n\r\n                         GARRETT\r\n          Ahhh!!!\r\n          The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag\r\n          and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.\r\n\r\n                         POLICE OFFICER #1\r\n          (holding up Corn Chips)\r\n          All clear.

That's detention,\r\n          Buster.\r\n\r\n                         PRINCIPAL SNUR\r\n          Enough, Amy.

Now if you'll\r\n          excuse me, my class has a state test to\r\n          prepare for.\r\n          Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.\r\n          Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,\r\n          the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Whoa.\r\n\r\n                         CHASE\r\n          Are you okay, Ms. Halsey?\r\n          Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Class dismissed.\r\n\r\n                         SASHA\r\n          But the bell didn't ring.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Get out of my face.\r\n          (then, to Garrett)\r\n          And leave the corn chips.\r\n          The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.\r\n          From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES\r\n          idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she\r\n          still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          (to no one)\r\n          But first, a nap.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt.\r\n          A paper is stuck to her face.\r\n          She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of\r\n          things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Balls!\r\n          She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.\r\n          After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,\r\n          papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into\r\n          the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST\r\n          MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:\r\n\r\n                         54 LAKEVIEW STREET\r\n          Peoria Il, 61602\r\n\r\n                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          Huh.\r\n          Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey...\r\n\r\n          I/E. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY\r\n          Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (V.0.)\r\n          Unfortunately, I can't make it in today.\r\n          My grandmother took a turn for the worse\r\n          and it looks like she's dead.\r\n\r\n          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT,\r\n          dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay\r\n          in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy\r\n          of \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\"\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH (V.0.)\r\n          Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral.

SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a\r\n          backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.\r\n\r\n                         FRAT GUY\r\n          Hi there.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Is Tucker here?\r\n\r\n                         FRAT GUY\r\n\r\n                         (DISAPPOINTED)\r\n          Yeah, hold on.

He turns away.\r\n          Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty\r\n          pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a\r\n          tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n\r\n          INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk,\r\n          unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room.\r\n          BOB MARLEY plays softly.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          Do you ever talk to my brother?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          No. He dumped me, remember?\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          You and my brother always had the\r\n          histrionics.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          So, do you want to come to our party\r\n          tonight? \"CEOs and Corporate Ho's?\"\r\n          We're kinda light on Ho's.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Like I told \"Frat Guy #1,\" I'm not\r\n          interested.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          Then what's up?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          I need some date rape drugs.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          (hurt, defensive)\r\n          Two things. Number one: who do you think\r\n          I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,\r\n          I'm in an awesome frat, but that really\r\n          hurts. And two: they're not \"date rape\"\r\n          drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for\r\n          weightlifting. It helps build mass,\r\n          okay? Why do you even want it?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         (DEADPAN)\r\n          For lifting.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          I have money and I'm in a rush.\r\n          She takes out a wad of cash.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          That's all you needed to say. No need to\r\n          get all histrionic on me.\r\n          Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a\r\n          small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small\r\n          bottle containing a clear liquid.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER (CONT'D)\r\n          One capful makes you feel really good.\r\n          Two capfuls will knock her out for a\r\n          couple hours. You don't want to take any\r\n          more than two.\r\n          Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and\r\n          then gives her a big, warm hug.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER (CONT'D)\r\n          Listen, I know you and my brother aren't\r\n          together anymore, but I still think of\r\n          you as a sister, okay?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Get your hand off my ass.\r\n\r\n                         TUCKER\r\n          Sorry, didn't even know I put it down\r\n          there.

With summer around the\r\n          corner, it's time to not only say goodbye\r\n          to another school year, but to also say\r\n          goodbye to one of our own.\r\n          Elizabeth smiles.\r\n\r\n          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)\r\n          Amy Squirrel.\r\n          Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a\r\n          pursed smile.\r\n\r\n          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)\r\n          After six short years of outstanding,\r\n          tireless work here, Amy is transferring\r\n          out of the district.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)\r\n          I know she'll bring her love for learning\r\n          to her new students.\r\n          Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up.\r\n\r\n                         SANDY\r\n          Speech! Speech!\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Although leaving was a difficult\r\n          choice...\r\n          Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to\r\n          continue.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          When the superintendent personally asks\r\n          you to work at one of the worst schools\r\n          in the state, you say yes. I'm looking\r\n          forward to bringing my brand of zany\r\n          energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for\r\n          learning to the underprivileged students\r\n          at Malcolm X High. I welcome the\r\n          challenge.\r\n          The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.\r\n          Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Here, I got you this.\r\n          Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and\r\n          unravels the \"Integrity\" poster that Elizabeth stole.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n          And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.\r\n          Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.\r\n\r\n                         SCOTT\r\n          Hey, Stranger.\r\n          (then, whispers)\r\n          Listen, now that Amy's transferring,\r\n          maybe the two of us could go grab a\r\n          drink.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         SCOTT\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Elizabeth walks out.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          CHYRON: THREE MONTHS LATER\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as\r\n           her bare leg steps out of the car, we\r\n\r\n          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          The hallway is empty. We FOLLOW Elizabeth from behind,\r\n          and as she reaches for the door to her class, we\r\n\r\n          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE\r\n          on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.\r\n          Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed\r\n          photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,\r\n          from the year before.\r\n          The bell RINGS.\r\n          Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE\r\n\r\n          BREASTS.\r\n          Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the\r\n          students as they reconnect with friends and share stories\r\n          about summer camp.\r\n          She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.\r\n          bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.\r\n\r\n          EIGHTH GRADE BOY\r\n          Do me! Do me!\r\n          Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.\r\n          Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both\r\n          of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees\r\n          Elizabeth and runs over.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          You and Chase, huh? She likes the\r\n          poetry?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         GARRETT\r\n          She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity.\r\n          But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around\r\n          here!\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          Easy.\r\n\r\n                         GARRETT\r\n          Well, I should get going. See you\r\n          around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice...\r\n          He points at her breasts.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n                         (TOUCHED)\r\n          Thanks! You're the first student to\r\n          notice.\r\n          Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's\r\n          cleaning another big stain from her shirt.\r\n\r\n                         LYNN\r\n          Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic\r\n          surgeon, actually. He's amazing.\r\n\r\n                         LYNN\r\n          He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him?\r\n          The internet?\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          No, in recovery. And I looked like ass,\r\n          so I know it's real.\r\n\r\n                         LYNN\r\n          Sounds like a fairy tale.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          It is. Storybook. Well, not total\r\n          storybook. It's a little messy because\r\n          his wife filed for divorce last week, but\r\n          we're gonna get through that.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          So you want to grab lunch later?\r\n\r\n                         LYNN\r\n          Sure! My treat.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n          No, you got it last time.
