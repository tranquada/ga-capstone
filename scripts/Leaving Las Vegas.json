SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\n</b>\tIt is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go \n\tto pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents \n\tand executives of all ages.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tInto this bar comes Ben.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBen is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit \n\tthat could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't \n\tshaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has \n\tany of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man \n\tbut is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still \n\tin control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the \n\tfollowing scene that he is much the worse for wear with \n\tdrink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he\n\trecognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples\n\tare seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde \n\tand busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. \n\tThe camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs\n\tlooks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays \n\this recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben \n\tis not looking at him.\n<b>\t \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tPeter\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tBen... how are you, man?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThey shake hands.

That's a \t\n\t\tbeautiful dress, Debbie, and \t\n\t\tthose are fabulous earrings, \t\n\t\tSheila.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThere is an awkward silence.

She is a beautiful American \n\tgirl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears \n\tcatalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt \n\tand matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. \n\tHeads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's \n\tclear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their \n\tglance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. \n\tShe could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many \n\texecs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language \n\tis a bit different, though.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tA view of night-time Las Vegas through a window.

Some people get out and the elevator climbs \n\thigher. We see from the indicator that she has punched \n\tthe Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we \n\tsee that she is nervous but concealing it well. The \n\televator stops, the doors open and she steps right \n\tinto the Penthouse.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tA bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. \n\tHe is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, \n\ta big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair \n\tis greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, \n\tall gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in \n\tbusiness suits and a weird stoned woman in her late \n\tthirties listen to him.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tYURI\n</b>\t\t...but please, my friends, \t\n\t\tcall me Yuri.

Ben finishes his drink and grimaces \n\tbefore indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. \n\tBarman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves \n\tin closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit \n\tfrom the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the \n\tTV sound that it is a word game with a big prize.

Her bruised face makes her suddenly \n\tvery conspicuous and vulnerable. A big man in a white stetson \n\tstands next to her. He looks at her and grins. She smiles, \n\tcoldly. He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar \n\tchips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each \n\tone against her nipples. Other people see this and stop and \n\twatch. Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man \n\tbecomes uncomfortable.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\tSTETSON MAN\n</b>\t\tWhat's the problem, \n\t\thoney?...
