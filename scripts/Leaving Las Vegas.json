SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT\n\t\n\t\t\n\tIt is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go \n\tto pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents \n\tand executives of all ages.\n\t\n\tInto this bar comes Ben.\n\t\n\tBen is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit \n\tthat could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't \n\tshaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has \n\tany of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man \n\tbut is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still \n\tin control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the \n\tfollowing scene that he is much the worse for wear with \n\tdrink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he\n\trecognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples\n\tare seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde \n\tand busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. \n\tThe camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs\n\tlooks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays \n\this recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben \n\tis not looking at him.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tPeter\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tBen... how are you, man?\n\t\n\tThey shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and \n\tPeter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him \n\tto the table.\n\t\n\tBen Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARC\n\t\tNice to meet you. I think I \t\n\t\tspoke to you on the phone a \t\n\t\tcouple of years ago. Weren't \t\n\t\tyou both at MGM with Laddie?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThat's right. Are you still\n\t\tat ICM?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARC\n\t\tNo, I'm at Tri-Star now.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThat's great. Say hello to \t\n\t\tMike for me. That's a \t\n\t\tbeautiful dress, Debbie, and \t\n\t\tthose are fabulous earrings, \t\n\t\tSheila.\n\t\n\tThere is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and \n\tis not invited to join them. The girls smile.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tMARC\n\t\tI gotta tell you, I'm a big \t\n\t\tfan of your writing. I loved \t\n\t\tBay of Pigs.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThanks a lot. I didn't \t\n\t\tactually write it, I just got \n\t\tthe credit. I was fired.\n\t\t\t(to Peter)\n\t\tCan I talk to you for a \t\n\t\tmoment?\n\t\n\tPeter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. \n\tPeter speaks very quietly.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tListen, Ben, I can't help you \n\t\tany more. Do you understand?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tThis is the last time. \t\n\t\tPromise. I just need some \t\n\t\tcash tonight. I lost my \t\n\t\tcredit cards. The money'll be \n\t\ton your desk first thing \t\n\t\ttomorrow morning, Scout's \t\n\t\thonor. How's the new one \t\n\t\tcoming along? I here you got \t\n\t\tRichard Gere.\n\t\n\tThe two men look at each other for a while. Peter's \n\tfriends are looking at them, as are other people in \n\tthe room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some \n\tnotes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tThis is all I have in cash. \t\n\t\tPlease don't drink it here.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYes, that's fine. I'll\t\n\t\tmessenger it over to you \t\n\t\ttomorrow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tI don't want it. Ben... I\n\t\tthink it would be best if you \n\t\tdidn't contact me again.\n\t\n\tAnd he turns and walks away, back to his table.\n\t\n\t\n\tCUT TO BLACK:\n\t\n\tTITLE ON BLACK; 'LAS VEGAS - 1.20 A.M.'\n\t\n\tFADE UP ON:\n\t\n\t2 EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY\n\t\n\tLas Vegas. A blaze of color in the middle of a desert.\n\t\n\tCredit sequence begins.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t3 INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tA mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense \n\tof activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts \n\tacross the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense \n\ttexture of thousands of slot machines, creating an \n\tinsane New Age symphony.\n\t\n\tCredit sequence ends.\n\t\t\n\tInto the lobby from the street comes Sera.\n\t\n\tIt's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between \n\ttwenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American \n\tgirl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears \n\tcatalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt \n\tand matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. \n\tHeads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's \n\tclear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their \n\tglance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. \n\tShe could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many \n\texecs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language \n\tis a bit different, though.\n\t\n\t4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tA view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up \n\tand down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.\n\tWe hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls \n\tfocus and we see reflected in the glass...\n\t\n\t...a group of people.\n\t\n\tOn the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and \n\tsandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two \n\tboxers pound the shit out of each other.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t5 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in \n\tthe elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens \n\ther lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs \n\thigher. We see from the indicator that she has punched \n\tthe Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we \n\tsee that she is nervous but concealing it well. The \n\televator stops, the doors open and she steps right \n\tinto the Penthouse.\n\t\n\t6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n\t\n\tA bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. \n\tHe is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, \n\ta big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair \n\tis greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, \n\tall gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in \n\tbusiness suits and a weird stoned woman in her late \n\tthirties listen to him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t...but please, my friends, \t\n\t\tcall me Yuri. It is my \t\n\t\tAmerican name... I picked it \t\n\t\tmyself.\n\t\n\tThe three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in \n\tthe way that they speak to Yuri.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFIRST BUSINESSMAN\n\t\tWhere are you from, Yuri? I \t\n\t\tmean, you sure don't talk \t\n\t\tlike you're from this neck of \n\t\tthe woods. \n\t\n\tYuri smiles at them.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(silky voice)\n\t\tNo... you are right, my \t\n\t\tfriend. How very observant \t\n\t\tyou are. I am from Latvia.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWEIRD WOMAN\n\t\tTough place.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tYes, I hear this too. But I \t\n\t\tam not a tough man. I am a \t\n\t\tsimple man who is here to \t\n\t\tlearn from my new American \t\n\t\tfriends.\n\t\n\tThe door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWEIRD WOMAN\n\t\t\t(turned on)\n\t\tIs this your friend, Yuri?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tAh, yes... Sera.\n\t\n\tThe second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from \n\this inside pocket.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI(cont'd)\n\t\tSera is my gift to you, my \t\n\t\tfriends from New York City. \t\n\t\tYou may do with her as you \t\n\t\twish in this beautiful room, \t\n\t\twhich is also my gift for the \n\t\tnight to my friends. You will \n\t\tfind her a very willing girl, \n\t\tfor all of you...just as we \t\n\t\tarranged.\n\t\n\tYuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the \n\tenvelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the \n\tidea of her.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSECOND BUSINESSMAN\n\t\tOf course, Yuri. I think \t\n\t\tyou'll find this just as we \t\n\t\tdiscussed.\n\t\t\n\tYuri gets up.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tSo, my friends... I have other \n\t\tbusiness to attend. Enjoy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tHe heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as \n\the passes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tYuri... please! Can I talk to \t\n\t\tyou for a moment.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tStill smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the \n\tbedroom.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tMy friends... excuse me for \t\n\t\tjust one moment. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t7 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \n\n\tMirrors reflect mirrors.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI don't want this. Yuri, \t\n\t\tplease. I really don't want \t\n\t\tthis. You know I don't like \t\n\t\tto do groups.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(playful)\n\t\tI want this, Sera. I need \t\n\t\tthis!   \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tPlease, Yuri.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tHe holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with one \n\tarm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(seductive)\n\t\tThese are pretty.\n\t\n\tSera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal \n\ther buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other \n\thand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks \n\tgently, like a father to a daughter.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI(cont'd)\n\t\tIs this how you would repay \t\n\t\tme for coming all this way to \n\t\tfind you again? Driving \t\n\t\tthrough the desert to protect \n\t\tmy little Sera.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\tFLASHBACK-SILENT-GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE\n\t\n\t8 INT. ROOM - NIGHT\n\tYuri and Sera - different time, different place. Sera looking \n\tfrightened, backing away from Yuri, who pulls a switchblade \n\tfrom his jacket and opens it.\n\t\n\t\n\tCUT BACK TO:\n\t\n\t9 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n\tYuri enters from the bedroom. The weird woman is doing a line \n\tof coke.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(cheerful)\n\t\tSera wanted me to ask if she \t\n\t\tmight undress at once for \t\n\t\tyou. She has a very beautiful \n\t\tundergarment witch she would \t\n\t\tlike you to see.\n\t\n\tANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR\n\t\n\tSera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning \n\ther jacket.\n\t\n\tShe takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips \n\ther skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and \n\tplaying the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWEIRD WOMAN\n\t\t\t(strange voice)\n\t\tCome here.\n\t\n\tSera walks over and something strange takes place between \n\tthem.\n\t\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\t\n\t10 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING\n\t\n\tThe bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is \n\ta very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los \n\tAngeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five \n\tcustomers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is \n\tsitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress \n\tand the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces \n\tbefore indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. \n\tBarman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves \n\tin closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit \n\tfrom the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the \n\tTV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles \n\tto himself.\n\t\n\tBEN'S POV OF TV\n\t\n\tThe talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the \n\taudience the prizes available in today's game show.\n\t\n\tANGLE ON BEN\n\t\n\tAs he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera \n\tmoves in close on his eyes. \n\t\n\tBEN'S POV OF TV\n\t\n\tShe turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV \n\tcamera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is \n\tsaying makes complete sense, but then things change...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\t\t(smoky, sexy voice)\n\t\tJust look at this studio, \t\n\t\tBen, filled with glamorous \t\n\t\tmerchandise, including an \t\n\t\textra special prize chosen \t\n\t\tjust for You! A big, bad, BMW \n\t\tmotorcycle, complete with \t\n\t\tsaddle bags stuffed with \t\n\t\tthousands of US dollars.\n\t\n\t\"There are oohs\" from the audience.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\tSo, Ben,\n\t\t\t(tosses her hair)\n\t\tLet's find a bar, get drunk \t\n\t\tand go for a ride.\n\t\n\tThe studio lights dim.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\tThen we can get a suite \t\n\t\tsomewhere and order up a case \n\t\tof champagne while we fuck \t\n\t\tourselves silly.\n\t\n\tClose-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\tThis is it, just for You,\n\t\tBen. \n\t\n\tShe unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her \n\tnipples hard.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\tBecause You've been so \n\t\tpatient, and because I want \n\t\tto fuck you, take care of \n\t\tYou, and because there's \n\t\tnothing else in the world \n\t\tworth doing.\n\t\n\tSection of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their \n\teyes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n\t\tTell you what, Ben, let's go \n\t\tto Las Vegas. The bars stay \n\t\topen twenty four hours night \n\t\tand day. Just you, just me, \n\t\tBen, think about it, all \n\t\tright? \n\t\n\tANGLE ON BEN\n\t\n\tLost in his fantasy\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'll think about it.\n\t\n\tHe looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to \n\twhat is known as \"normal\". He finishes his drink and then an \n\tattack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls \n\this neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. \n\tBen looks at his own hands...which are steady.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARMAN\n\t\tYou should go on that show.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t11 INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING\n\t\n\tBen sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup \n\tof black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with \n\t\tframed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed \n\twith scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says \n\t'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on \n\tthe other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes \n\tup to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of \n\tmessages down on the desk.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYeah, but what's the back end \n\t\tlike? By the time we're \n\t\tthrough with P and A, the \n\t\tabove-the line is going to \n\t\ttake it to about fifteen and \n\t\twith something like this... I \n\t\tdon't know if Disney will go \n\t\tfor it... can I call you back \n\t\ton this? OK... chow for now.\n\t\t\t(to the woman)\n\t\tGood morning.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(cautious)\n\t\tBen... Mr. Simpson was looking \n\t\tfor you. I said that you had \n\t\ta doctor's appointment. He \n\t\tsaid for you to go in as soon \n\t\tas... are you OK?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(pulling himself together)\n\t\tI'm fantastic, but I gotta go \n\t\tout now... very important \n\t\tmeeting, could make a coupla \n\t\tmillion for the company.\n\t\n\tBen gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a \n\tfew steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face \n\tgets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and \n\tshe turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(tender)\n\t\tBen?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhat?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tYou should go now.\n\t\n\tShe leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the \n\tdesk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his \n\twhole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls \n\tout a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the \n\t\tcontents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the \n\troom.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t12 INT. SMART OFFICE - DAY\n\t\n\tBen is sitting opposite his boss, Mr. Simpson, who is very \n\tupset. He hands Ben an envelope. Ben opens it and pulls out a \n\tcheck. He looks at the amount.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(genuinely moved) \n\t\tThis is to generous Peter.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSIMPSON\n\t\t\t(close to tears)\n\t\tWell... we liked having you \n\t\taround, Ben, but you know how \n\t\tit is.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(ashamed)\n\t\tSure thing... and I'm sorry.\n\t\n\tBen takes a swig from his coffee cup.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSIMPSON\n\t\t\t(trying to cheer things along)\n\t\tWell... what are you going to \n\t\tdo now?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI thought I might move out to \n\t\tLas Vegas.\n\t\n\tSimpson looks puzzled.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThe bars never close.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t13 INT. BEN'S BMW \u0097 DAY\n\t\n\tBen drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a \n\tsmall bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty \n\tbottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.\n\t\n\tHe slips a tape into the player and we hear \"Lonely \n\tTeardrops\", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. \n\tAt a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and \n\tBen takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the \n\tword \"hot\". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and \n\tthey both pull away.\n\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t14 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET \u0097 DAY\n\t\n\tBen carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows \n\thim as he walks down the street. He looks at... \n\t\n\tBEN'S POV\n\t\n\tA girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is \n\twalking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's \n\tthoughts.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(voice-over)\n\t\tBeautiful, no just the shape \n\t\twhich is nice, but the whole \n\t\twalk, the feeling, the \n\t\tmovement. This girl is \n\t\tpleased with herself. Maybe \n\t\tthis is the only art I can \n\t\tappreciate... I don't know if \n\t\tthis is good or bad, but \n\t\tright now she is really \n\t\tbeautiful. When I was a boy \n\t\tit would have been really \n\t\timportant that she have a \n\t\tpretty face, to go with this \n\t\tbody, I mean. I still would \n\t\tlike to see her face, but her \n\t\tbeauty is no dependent on her \n\t\tface.\n\t\n\tThe dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she \n\tbends down to pull at its collar. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(voice-over)\n\t\tI wonder what kind of panties \n\t\tshe's wearing. Shit, that's \n\t\ttoo specific, but... on the \n\t\tother hand, you can never be \n\t\ttoo specific... but then, the \n\t\tinfinitesimal must be, by \n\t\tdefinition, as infinite as \n\t\tthe infinite.\n\t\n\tSuddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot \n\tresist looking into her face.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(voice-over)\n\t\tGod, she's so young.\n\t\t\n\tThe girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,\n\t\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tHi!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHi... \n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t15 EXT. BEN'S HOUSE IN SANT MONICA - DAY\n\t\n\tBen walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. A \n\tyoung boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up \n\tbike. Ben greets him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHey, Brad... how's it going?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBRAD\n\t\tHey Ben. There were a couple \n\t\tof guys looking for you.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhat did they look like?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBRAD\n\t\tSuits. I didn't tell them \n\t\tanything. You know anything \n\t\tabout gears?\n\t\n\tBen takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of \n\tshape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way \n\the deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his \n\thands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the \n\tchain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHow'd this happen? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBRAD\n\t\tI was going real fast down on \n\t\tthe beach and something \n\t\tslipped and everything got \n\t\tjammed up.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThe news is not good, kid. \n\t\tThis bit here... see \n\t\tthere... it's broken. You need \n\t\ta new  one.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBRAD\n\t\t\t(upset)\n\t\t\tHow much, do you think?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI don't know. I'll find out \n\t\tthough.\n\t\n\tBen gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. He \n\tlooks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking \n\ttotally dejected. This really seems to upset Ben.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t16 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tBen is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. \n\tThe house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He \n\tpours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up \n\tthe glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles \n\tDavis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns \n\ton the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He \n\tputs the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to \n\tthe deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the \n\tsecond track without any problem. The music starts and \n\tcontinues through the next sequence. \n\t\n\t17 INT. SHOVER - DAY\n\t\n\tBen is in the shower with the glass in his hand.\n\t\n\t18 INT.

LIVING SPACE - DAY\n\t\n\tShowered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks \n\thandsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets \n\tup the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up \n\tfull and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He \n\ttries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. \n\tIn slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. \n\tHe smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a \n\twhile... \n\t\n\tFADE OUT:\n\t\n\tFADE IN:\n\t\n\t20 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM. LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\t\n\tSera wakes up in bed next to Yuri. (The camera is high above \n\tthe bed looking down.) She is completely drenched in sweat. A \n\tthin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and \n\t\tfalls across their bodies. Other than that, the room is in \n\tdarkness. To get out of bed she would have to climb over him. \n\tShe lies still. Yuri speaks without opening his eyes... \n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tI missed you, Sera. You have \n\t\tbeen lonely?\n\t\n\tSera blinks and turns her head towards him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI'm older now, Yuri.\n\t\n\tHe puts his hand between her legs, over the sheets and grasps \n\ther there.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tYou have been lonely?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(tensing a little)\n\t\tI've been all right.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tI will keep you safe.

Mom was with Helen, and \n\t\tDad looked around first to \n\t\tsee if she was watching and \n\t\tthen he scraped it all off \n\t\tand threw it on the grass and \n\t\tthen he kissed me and hugged \n\t\tme and told me it was all \n\t\tright... \n\t\t\n\t22 INT. SERA'S KITCHEN. LATER THAT DAY\n\t\n\tYuri is tucking into a hearty breakfast. Sera plays with her \n\tfood.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(planning his day)\n\t\tThis is such a small \n\t\tapartment, Sera. I cannot \n\t\tstay here. We will find a big \n\t\tapartment. You know how much \n\t\tmoney I can bring you. I \n\t\tbelong in... \n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\t... wealth and luxury.\n\t\n\tHe suddenly looks up from his food and smiles at her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tWhy did you run away from me \n\t\tin Los Angeles?\n\t\n\tSera says nothing.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tBecause you are sly. Mmm? You \n\t\tknew all along that there was \n\t\tmore money in Las Vegas. \n\t\tDidn't you?\n\t\n\tSera nervously plays with her food.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tYou have nothing to fear from \n\t\tme. You know why? Because we \n\t\tbelong together, Sera. Don't \n\t\twe?\n\t\n\tSera forces a smile.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tYes.\n\t\n\tQUICK CUT TO:\n\t\n\tFLASHBACK:\n\t\n\t23 INT.

SERA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tI'm pleased with you, \n\t\tSera... how you have moved up \n\t\tin the world. I showed you a \n\t\tglamorous world when I took \n\t\tyou off the streets... \n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tand how you repay me.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA \n\t\tWhere have you been staying?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tWith an old friend.\n\t\n\tHe drops his fork.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tBut that is none of your \n\t\taffair. You will call this \n\t\tmorning and book me into a \n\t\thotel suite where I will make \n\t\tnew contacts for us.\n\t\t\n\tThe mood has changed and Sera does her best to move out of \n\tthese dangerous waters.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYou'll need some money, then.\n\t\n\tYuri nods. Sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds \n\tmoney.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(becoming angry)\n\t\tIt is, after all, Sera, my \n\t\tmoney.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t\t(calmly)\n\t\tYes, of course. How much do \n\t\tyou need?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tAll of it. I need to buy many \n\t\tthings... all of it!\n\t\n\tYuri is very angry and as Sera hands him the money, he hits \n\ther, hard, knocking her back into the refrigerator. His ring \n\tcuts her cheek.\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tDon't look at me like that.\n\t\n\tAnd then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her. \n\tHe takes her face in his hands to look at the cut.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tIt's not so bad. It is \n\t\tnothing.\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tI need money, Sera. I need it \n\t\tfast. You must go on the \n\t\tstreet tonight. For me.\n\t\t\n\tHe sits down with shaking hands. He suddenly seems more \n\tvulnerable than she is. He goes to the window and looks out, \n\tleft and then right, as if he expects to see something.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tI need money fast, Sera. I \n\t\twant you back on the street. \n\t\tTonight.\n\t\t\n\tFADE OUT:\n\t\n\tFADE IN SLOWLY - SOUND FIRST:\n\t\n\t25 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen opens his eyes. The only light comes from the TV. The \n\tmiles Davis record has got caught on a scratch and is \n\trepeating the sane phrase over and over again. He looks at \n\this gold Rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his \n\tfinger.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t26 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen is sitting at the bar. He drinks a large glass of \n\tsomething very quickly and then immediately orders another.\n\t\n\tHe drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes \n\tit and then orders another. He looks around the bar and sees \n\ta woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. \n\tShe looks and sees Ben, and he smiles at her. She smiles \n\tright back. Ben talks across the bar. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(charming)\n\t\tGood evening.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\t\t(pleased)\n\t\tHi.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'm Benjamin...Ben.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\tI'm Teri.\n\t\n\tBen walks over to where she is. She is pleased that this \n\tgood-looking man has come over to make a play. She makes a \n\tnoise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'll get you another \n\t\tone... and me too. Mind if I \n\t\tjoin you?\n\t\n\tShe watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks \n\tback to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits \n\tdown. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she \n\tsmells the booze on him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\tWow... been drinking all day?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tBut of course.\n\t\n\tShe looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She \n\tis no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this \n\tmuch is clear to Ben.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhy don't we finish these and \n\t\tgo to my apartment on the \n\t\tbeach?\n\t\n\tShe doesn't respond.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWe can watch a movie and I'll \n\t\tmix you up a gooey blender \n\t\tdrink.\n\t\t\n\tBen winces at his own words. He shakes his head.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\tI have to get up pretty early \n\t\ttomorrow. I'll just finish \n\t\tthis and go. Thanks anyway.\n\t\t\n\tThey drink in silence for a while. Ben takes a deep breath.0\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(pathetic)\n\t\tI really wish that you'd come \n\t\thome with me. You're so cute \n\t\tand I'm really good in \n\t\tbed... believe me... you smell \n\t\tgood too... \n\t\n\tHe stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo, OK.\n\t\n\tBen tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the \n\tbar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're \n\tup they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all \n\tfalls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of \n\tgreat sadness comes over her.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\tI have to go now. Thanks \n\t\tanyway.\n\t\n\tShe stands to go.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRETTY WOMAN\n\t\tMaybe you shouldn't drink so \n\t\tmuch.\n\t\n\tShe walks to the door and Ben turns to the bar, watched by he \n\tBarman, who is a little concerned.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tMaybe I shouldn't breathe so \n\t\tmuch, Teri. Ha... ha.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARMAN\n\t\t\t(sever voice)\n\t\tTime to go, buddy... We're \n\t\tclosing up.\n\t\n\tBen gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much \n\tthat he cannot extract any bills. He is very embarrassed and \n\ttries again, but to no avail.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWould you... ?\n\t\n\tThe barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the \n\twallet and takes some money.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t27 EXT.

The trio grinds out a dirty \n\tblues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage \n\tand as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between \n\ther legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and \n\ta bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\t\t(hostile)\n\t\tThree-fifty.\n\t\n\tBen puts down a hundred on to her tray.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(polite)\n\t\tCould I have fives please? \n\t\tKeep one for yourself.\n\t\n\tThis throws the Waitress for a loop.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t29 INT. BATHROOM OF STRIP CLUB - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen drinks all of a fifth of bourbon. Other guys come and go, \n\tpissing against the urinal. Ben offers one of the guys a \n\tdrink, the pianist from the trio. He takes a shot.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t30 INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen sits next to another man watching the show. On stage a \n\ttall blonde dances with her own reflection in a mirror.

He's looking for a prostitute. He sees a girl, but \n\twhen he slows down she ducks into a doorway. \n\t\n\tHe looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up \n\tfast. Ben panics for a second. There is a bottle between his \n\tlegs. The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a \n\twhile, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, \n\tdoing a U-turn.\n\t\t\n\tBen continues and then sees an Hispanic girl and stops. He \n\twinds down the window. He is by now almost incoherent.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tGood evening.\n\t\n\t32 EXT.

You pay \n\t\tfor it.\n\t\n\tBen laughs.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tOK... but only because I think \n\t\tthat the concept of surrender \n\t\tfits in with the big picture \n\t\tright now. How about over \n\t\tthere?\n\t\n\tHe gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the \n\tstreet. She sets off and he gets out of the car. As he does, \n\ta wave of nausea hits him. He shakes his head violently and \n\tthen lurches across the street, causing two cars to hit their \n\tbrakes. The camera follows him into the dark parking lot of \n\tthe motel, where the Hispanic girl is waiting.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(slurring badly)\n\t\tI canremember... if \n\t\tmywifeleffme... or Illeff \n\t\ther... bufuckittanyway... \n\t\n\tThe girl laughs at Ben and says something in Spanish.\n\t\n\tSlowly the picture gets darker, until all that can be seen is \n\tthe headlights from the passing cars on Sunset... and then... \n\t\n\t33 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAWN\n\t\n\tBen wakes up on the kitchen floor. The fridge door is open \n\tand its light is what lights Ben. Inside the fridge are one \n\tgreen pepper and four bottles of vodka. Without too much \n\teffort Ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still \n\tthere, as are his car keys. He closes the fridge door and in \n\tthe green light from the window he lies still.

Why don't I come \n\t\tback after lunch, when I'm \n\t\tfeeling a little better? We \n\t\tcan take care of it then.\n\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t41 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA. - MORNING\n\t\n\tBen seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him. The \n\tBarman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes \n\tsome bills, shaking his head in disapproval. The TV is on, \n\tsome game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking \n\tfor a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its \n\t'normal' fashion. The only difference is that the hostess is \n\tplayed by the girl in the bank. Ben grabs the Barman's \n\tattention.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI think, when I'm done with \n\t\tthis, I'll have gin and \n\t\ttonic... Bombay gin and tonic.\n\t\t\n\tThe Barman loses it\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARMAN\n\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tYou should be having coffee. \n\t\tDo you know what time it is? \n\t\tYou're a young man.\n\t\t\t(calmer)\n\t\tIt's none of my business, but \n\t\tif you could see what I see, \n\t\tyou wouldn't do this to \n\t\tyourself.\n\t\n\tBen is taken aback by the emotion in his voice.

The young hooker leaves with \n\ther dangerous guy. She pauses long enough to give Sera a \n\tnasty smile. The conventioneer pays for the drink and is a \n\tlittle lost for words. Sera tries to help.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tSo... are you alone, or are \n\t\tyou just using me to make \n\t\tsomeone else jealous?\n\t \n\t\t\t\tCONVENTIONEER\n\t\t\t(laughs nervously)\n\t\tAlone.

Why?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(moving a little closer)\n\t\tWell... I thought you might be \n\t\tlooking for a date.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCONVENTIONEER\n\t\t\t(shocked)\n\t\tA date. What, are you a \n\t\thooker?\n\t\t\t(voice getting louder)\n\t\tWhat do you mean a date?\n\t\t\t(and louder)\n\t\tI've got a wife back home.

Sera is uncomfortable. People are watching her, \n\taware that something has been going on. The Barman comes over \n\tto where Sera is sitting.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARMAN\n\t\tMaybe you should give it a \n\t\tmiss for this evening.\n\t\n\tHe walks away. Sera finishes her drink and leaves.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t71 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSera at work is looking more carefully than usual, hoping to \n\tsee Ben. A huge silver limo pulls up and, after some \n\tnegotiation, she gets in. \n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t72 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT\n\t\n\tLong-lens shot of Ben, very drunk on the street. He falls and \n\tlies still for quite a long time before getting up. He falls \n\tinto the road and tries to hail a cab, but none stops. A cop \n\tcar cruises to a halt and Ben more or less imitates a normal \n\tperson as he walks out of shot.\n\t\n\t73 EXT. THE POOL, MOTEL - DAY\n\t\n\tBen dives in and swims a length under water. He pulls himself \n\tout and sits next to the large Midwestern family. The father \n\tsays hello and introduces his family to Ben. They are all \n\tvery friendly. It's a nice atmosphere around this pool and \n\tfor a moment Ben even looks healthy.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t74 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT\n\t\n\tA limo pulls up and Sera gets out.

CORRIDOR OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSera walks along, checking numbers on the doors. She finds \n\tthe right one and knocks firmly.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI (v.o)\n\t\tYes? What?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tIt's me, Yuri.\n\t\n\tThe door opens a crack and Yuri peers out.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tSera!

I \n\t\tthink things are picking up.\n\t\t\n\tYuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His \n\tface is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be \n\tlistening for something, because he stops her talking by \n\tputting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then \n\t\tbeckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the \n\tbed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a \n\twave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri \n\tseems to be deranged.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tHave you told anyone that I'm \n\t\there?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tNo.\n\t\n\tYuri suddenly hears something. He grabs Sera's hand and takes \n\ther to the wall. He presses her head to the wall.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tDo you here that?\n\t\n\tHe looks at her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tThey're talking about me.\n\t\n\tHe pulls himself together.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\tGo, Sera.\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tGo.

Now go.\n\t\n\tThey face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an \n\talmost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the \n\tdoor and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her \n\tblouse. He slams the door. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tYURI\n\t\t\t(through the door)\n\t\tGoodbye, Sera. Don't come \n\t\tback here. I will not see you \n\t\tagain.\n\t\n\tSera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she \n\t\tbegins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way \n\tdown the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men \n\tare walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they \n\tmake their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn \n\ta corner. We recognize them as the men from the black \n\tTown Car.\n\t\n\tANGLE\n\t\n\tThe men have stopped outside Yuri's room. The camera pans and \n\twe see Sera down the other corridor getting into the \n\televator.\n\t\n\tFADE OUT:\n\t\n\t77 INT. BEN'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen is lying on the bed watching a game show, drinking.\n\t\n\tA coughing fit hits him. He is very short of breath.

I'm fine.\n\t\n\tThe tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and \n\tunlocks it, but keeps the chain on.

He gets up and walks around the house, trying \n\tto get a sense of her. The furniture is very plain and there \n\tis spartan quality about the hose. He looks with interest at \n\tthe bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tThis is the home of an angel.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA (off-screen)\n\t\tYou OK out there?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYes.

Finally he pushes it away and orders another \n\tdrink.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI'm from the East. I went to \n\t\tcollege, did an arts course. \n\t\tI now live in Vegas. I think \n\t\tof it as home. I came here \n\t\tdeliberately to carve out a \n\t\tlife. I was in LA before, but \n\t\tI'll come back to that later.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tThe tough times are behind me \n\t\tnow. I can deal with the bad \n\t\tthings that happen. There \n\t\twill always be dark \n\t\tcharacters. But my life is \n\t\tgood. It is as I would want \n\t\tit to be. So, why are you a \n\t\tdrunk? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tIs that really what you want \n\t\tto ask me? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(worried)\n\t\tWell, then I guess this is \n\t\tour first date... or our last. \n\t\tUntil now, I wasn't sure it \n\t\twas either.\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tVery clever.\n\t\n\t\tSera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on \n\tthis.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tFirst.

He takes a slug from his drink. She sits back.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWe'll talk about it some \n\t\tother time maybe. OK?\n\t\n\tSera relaxes and continues with her food. We hear her \n\tthoughts for a moment.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA (v.o)\n\t\tIt wasn't so important to me. \n\t\tI mean, he never asked me why \n\t\tI was a hooker, sand that was \n\t\timpressive. I really liked \n\t\thim. So I decided to just \n\t\tplay my part. I mean... it's \n\t\tgood to help someone once in \n\t\ta while., it's a bonus to \n\t\tbeing alive, and that was my \n\t\tplan... to stay alive.

SERA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\t\n\tSera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside \n\ther house. They stop her. They are also her landlord.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHUSBAND\n\t\tWe didn't know whether to \n\t\tcall the police or not.\n\t\n\tAnd they indicate the sleeping figure of Ben, in the doorway, \n\tclutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWIFE\n\t\tHe's been there for about \n\t\thalf an hour. My husband \n\t\tthought he'd seen you two \n\t\ttogether, but I thought it \n\t\tbest to wait until you got \n\t\thome.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYes, he's my friend. I guess \n\t\the just had a little too much \n\t\tto drink.\n\t\t\t(smiling uncomfortably)\n\t\tI'll help him inside.\n\t\t\t(puts down her packages)\n\t\tThanks for the concern. Sorry \n\t\tto trouble you.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHUSBAND\n\t\t\t(gallantly)\n\t\tWell, call me if there's \n\t\tanything I can do.\n\t\t\n\tThey go to their own house. Sera opens the front door, kneels \n\tdown next to Ben and shakes him gently.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tCan you wake up?\n\t\n\tBen opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful \n\texpression.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHi!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWhy don't you go in and sit \n\t\tdown. I have some gifts for \n\t\tyou.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tRight... OK... \n\t\n\tBen stands and almost loses his balance. He picks up his \n\tsuitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but \n\tshe stop him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tDon't worry... I got'em.\n\t\n\tBen staggers in with his case. As Sera enters, she looks \n\taround and sees Husband and Wife at the window, still \n\twatching.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN (off-screen)\n\t\t\tWant a drink? Great nap. \n\t\tWanna go out tonight?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tSeriously, Ben... I need to \n\t\tkeep pretty low-key around \n\t\there. Maybe next time you \n\t\tcould nap this side of the \n\t\tdoor. That was the landlord.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tOf course.\n\t\n\tShe reaches into her purse.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tGift number one.\n\t\n\tAnd she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it \n\tin the lock, then drops it into his pocket.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI used to carry a lot of \n\t\tkeys, but one by one they all \n\t\tfell victim to the great \n\t\tcondensation. Now I have just \n\t\tthis one... which is... \n\t\t\n\tAnd he tails off and stares at the floor. She waits for him \n\tto continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm.\n\t\n\t87 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tBen?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tSorry.\n\t\n\tHe shakes his head.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI was miles away.\n\t\n\tHe sees the parcels.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tAh... more gifts. I have to \n\t\tsit down for this.\n\t\n\tHe strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. She \n\tfollows.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tSera, I love that \n\t\t\tname... S.E.R.A. Before we \n\t\tproceed onwards, there is \n\t\tsomething I need to say. OK?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tOK.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI've come this far... here I \n\t\tam, in your house. I want you \n\t\tto let me pay the rent for \n\t\tthis month. All right?\n\t\t\n\tAnd he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen \n\tuntil this matter is resolved.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWhy?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tBecause... it's better for me \n\t\tthat way. OK?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWell... OK... \n\t\n\tShe is uncomfortable.\n\t\n\tThey sit in silence for a while.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tSera... I hope that you \n\t\tunderstand how I feel about \n\t\tthis. First of all, you're \n\t\twelcome to my money. We can \n\t\tbuy a couple of cases of \n\t\tliquor and you can have the \n\t\trest. But I don't think \n\t\tyou're talking to me right \n\t\tnow about money.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tNo?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo. I think you're talking \n\t\tabout you. I'll tell you \n\t\tright now that I'm in love \n\t\twith you... but, be that as it \n\t\tmay, I'm not here to force my \n\t\ttwisted life into your soul.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI know that... \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t... and I'm not here to demand \n\t\tyour attention to the point \n\t\twhere it changes your life. \n\t\tWe know I'm a drunk... but \n\t\tthat seems to be all right \n\t\twith you. And I know that \n\t\tyou're a hooker. I hope you \n\t\tunderstand that I'm a person \n\t\twho is totally at ease with \n\t\tthis... which is not to say \n\t\tthat I'm indifferent or that \n\t\tI don't care... I do... it \n\t\tsimply means that I trust and \n\t\taccept your judgement. What \n\t\tI'm saying is... that I hope \n\t\tyou understand that I \n\t\tunderstand.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tThanks, I do understand. I \n\t\twas worried about how that \n\t\twould be... but now I'm not. \n\t\tAnd you should know that \n\t\tincluded with the rent here \n\t\tis a complimentary blow job.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tAh, yes... I suppose sooner or \n\t\tlater we ought to fuck.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWhatever that means. Open \n\t\tyour presents.\n\t\n\tShe hands him the larger of the two parcels.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tOpen this one first.\n\t\n\tBen awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A \n\tgenuine smile comes on to his face.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tVery nice.\n\t\n\tHe holds the shirt against himself.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThis should work very nicely \n\t\twith my suit, which, by the \n\t\tway, is the only item of \n\t\tclothing I brought over from \n\t\tthe motel with me.\n\t\t\t\n\tSera raise an eyebrow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tRight... the suitcase was \n\t\tclinking. So what did you do \n\t\twith your clothes?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\tI threw them into the \n\t\tgarbage., which was perhaps \n\t\timmoral, but I wanted to come \n\t\tto you clean, so to speak. I \n\t\tthought we could go shopping \n\t\tand pick up a pair of jeans \n\t\tand forty-five pairs of \n\t\tunderwear and just throw them \n\t\tout each day.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tNice talk, Ben. Keep \n\t\tdrinking. In between the \n\t\thundred and one proof breath \n\t\tand the occasional drool, \n\t\tsome interesting words fall \n\t\tfrom your mouth.\n\t\t\n\tShe hands him the last present.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tNow, try this one.\n\t\n\tBen unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He \n\tis very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWell... looks like I'm with \n\t\tthe right girl.\n\t\t\n\tHe turns it in his hands.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI must say that I'm very \n\t\timpressed that you would buy \n\t\tthis for me. I know you \n\t\twouldn't do this without \n\t\tthinking about it. \n\t\tFunny... you did just what I \n\t\twould have done.\n\t\t\n\tBen stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is \n\tfine. He walks to the door.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'm going to fill it right \n\t\tnow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tDo you want to go gambling \n\t\ttonight? We could go out and \n\t\tplay for a few hours.\n\t\t\n\tBen comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit \n\tpocket and has a drink.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI hadn't planned to \n\t\tgamble... but if you would \n\t\tkeep the bulk of my money \n\t\there, then I could safely \n\t\tblow a couple of hundred \n\t\tbucks.\n\t\t\n\tHe takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and \n\tthen gives her the rest.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tGiving you money makes me \n\t\twant to come.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tThen come.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI'm going to change. Watch \n\t\tTV. I'll be half an hour.\n\t\n\tAnd she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben \n\tis not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the \n\tsmall angle of the door as she changes.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI am planning to go out and \n\t\tdo some work.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhen?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tTomorrow night as a matter of \n\t\tfact.\n\t\n\t88 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen and Sera walking. The camera follows them. He is wearing \n\this new shirt and looks good in it. She is wearing a green \n\tdress and mismatched earrings and looks great. They walk and \n\ttalk.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI like your earrings.\n\t\n\tHe changes sides.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI like women who wear \n\t\tmismatched earrings.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWell, then... I hope we don't \n\t\trun into any tonight.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI expect some kind of loyalty \n\t\there. Just because I fuck for \n\t\tmoney doesn't give you cause \n\t\tto start picking up women and \n\t\tleaving me looking silly.\n\t\t\n\tAnd she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tAnd I only have eyes for you. \n\t\tAnd we both know that you \n\t\twould never become \n\t\tromantically involved with a \n\t\ttrick, right?\n\t\t\n\t89 INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThey walk around the huge space, which is full of people and \n\tenergy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a \n\tslot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and \n\tthen she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some \n\tchange, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a \n\tbeat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to \n\tthe bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. \n\tThey break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As \n\the waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his \n\tarm. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tI love you.\n\t\n\tBut he doesn't hear her.\n\t\n\tANGLE ON CASINO ACTIVITY\n\t\n\tOn long lens we see Ben and Sera at the bar. Suddenly Ben \n\t\tseems to fall asleep. Sera tries to wake him and then he goes \n\tcrazy and falls backwards off his stool, knocking a waitress \n\tand her drinks over. Security Guards appear and begin arguing \n\twith Sera.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t90 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBen wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. A night-light gives \n\ta soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on \n\tthe floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door \n\tand takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With \n\tdifficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a \n\tdrink. He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just \n\tin case he has to vomit.\n\t\n\t91 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSera wakes and Ben comes in and gets into bed with her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tHow are you doing?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tVery well... umm... I never \n\t\texpected to have to ask you \n\t\tthis again... but how did our \n\t\tevening go? I remember \n\t\tgetting to the casino... I \n\t\tremember kissing you... that \n\t\twas really nice but \n\t\teverything after that is a \n\t\tblank.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWell - I was prepared for \n\t\tworse, but it wasn't so bad. \n\t\tWe were sitting at the bar, \n\t\ttalking about blackjack. You \n\t\tseemed just fine, a little \n\t\tdrunker than usual, but \n\t\tnothing really strange, but \n\t\tthen your head started to \n\t\tdroop and I put my arm on \n\t\tyour shoulder and then, wham, \n\t\tyou swung you arm at me, and \n\t\tfell backwards off your stool \n\t\tinto a cocktail waitress. You \n\t\tsmashed everything on her \n\t\ttray, it was a real mess. You \n\t\tkept yelling and yelling.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tOh, and what did you do?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI tried to shut you up and \n\t\thelp you to your feet but you \n\t\tkept swinging at me - not \n\t\tlike you wanted to hit me, \n\t\tbut more just waving me away. \n\t\tSecurity came and when you \n\t\tsaw them you stopped yelling. \n\t\tThey wanted to carry you out \n\t\tand dump you on the street, \n\t\tbut I talked them into \n\t\tletting me walk you out.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThat's impressive. How did \n\t\tyou do that?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI told them you were an \n\t\talcoholic and T would take \n\t\tyou home. I also promised \n\t\tthat we would never come in \n\t\tthere again.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWe?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYes, we.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(holds her hand)\n\t\tWhat happened then?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYou were OK for a while, so \n\t\twe walked for about a block \n\t\tand then you said you wanted \n\t\tto go home and fuck, but I \n\t\tthink even you knew that \n\t\twasn't going to happen. We \n\t\tgot a cab and you asked him \n\t\tto stop at a liquor store, \n\t\teven though I told you that \n\t\twe had plenty at home. In the \n\t\tstore you gave the kid a \n\t\thundred and told him to keep \n\t\tthe change. I asked you if \n\t\tyou knew it was a hundred. \n\t\tYou said you did, so I let \n\t\tyou do it. We got here, you \n\t\tfell asleep on the couch and \n\t\tI covered you up and came to \n\t\tbed.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI warned you... \n\t\t\t(kisses her hand)\n\t\t... but I'm sorry.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tHere's my speech... \n\t\t\t(kisses his hand)\n\t\t... I know this shouldn't be \n\t\tacceptable to m, but it is. \n\t\tDon't ask me why. I sense \n\t\tthat your trouble is very \n\t\tbig... and I'm scared for \n\t\tyou... and so I'm doing what I \n\t\tthink you need me to do. \n\t\tFalling down in casinos is \n\t\tlittle stuff. It doesn't \n\t\tbother me. It has nothing to \n\t\tdo with us.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThat's amazing. What are you? \n\t\tSome sort of angel visiting \n\t\tme from one of my drunk \n\t\tfantasies? How can you be so \n\t\tgood?\n\t\t\n\tShe turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI don't know what you're \n\t\tsaying. I'm just using you. I \n\t\tneed you. Can we not talk \n\t\tabout it any more, please. \n\t\tNot another word.\n\t\t\n\tHe thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying \n\ton her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes \n\ther naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhy don't you go back to \n\t\tsleep. I'll go out and buy us \n\t\tsome breakfast.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tBe careful.\n\t\n\tHe stands and goes to the door.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tDon't worry.\n\t\n\tAs he leaves the room, she calls after him.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tBen, I'm  working tonight.\n\t\n\tHe opens the door and smiles at her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI know.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t92 EXT. SIDEWALK - EARLY MORNING\n\t\n\tBen gets out of his  cab and walks up to the doorway of a \n\tgrocery store. It is locked. Ben looks at his wrist and then \n\tremembers that he no longer has a watch. He looks around, \n\tsees something and exits frame.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t93 INT. ROUGH ENGLISH BAR - EARLY MORNING\n\t\n\tBen enters and makes his way to the bar. This is a dirty, \n\tdark place. An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing \n\tby herself at the jukebox. A very drunk Biker Couple argue \n\tnoisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much \n\tgambling taking place at the eight slot machines. Ben sits at \n\tthe bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tA beer and a double kamikaze \n\t\tplease.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARTENDER\n\t\tSure thing. Anything to eat?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNot quite yet. First I have \n\t\tto drink myself sober, \n\t\tthen... a few crackers, maybe \n\t\tan egg and toast... \n\t\t\n\tThe Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues \n\tanyway.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t... then I'll go home with the \n\t\tgroceries and we'll have \n\t\tbreakfast together, and \n\t\tthat'll make her feel better \n\t\tabout my condition... \n\t\t\n\tBen is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl. She is \n\tyoung tough and pretty. She puts an arm around him and \n\tpresses against him.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tWho the fuck are you talking \n\t\tto, Mr?\n\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\tWhy are you all dressed up, \n\t\thoney? My, don't you look \n\t\tfine.\n\t\n\tShe runs her tongue around her mouth.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tI am very bored with my date. \n\t\tWould you like to buy me a \n\t\tdrink?\n\t\n\tBen looks around and sees the Biker staring at the two of \n\tthem.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(loudly)\n\t\tDo you mind if I buy her a \n\t\tdrink?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER\n\t\tFuck her. I don't care what \n\t\tthe fuck you do with her.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tMaybe I could buy you both a \n\t\tdrink?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER\n\t\tFuck you. Don't fuck with me, \n\t\tmotherfucker. Fuck off. Go to \n\t\tit, she's waiting for her \n\t\tdrink.\n\t\n\tThe Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping \n\tin quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tSee what an asshole he is.\n\t\t\t(big smile)\n\t\tI'll have a rum and Coke.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tBarman? A rum and Coke, \n\t\tplease.\n\t\n\tThe Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who  \n\tis facing the bar on a stool. She brings her face closer to \n\this.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tCan I stay with you for a \n\t\twhile?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYou mean move in with me? \n\t\tIsn't this a bit sudden?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tOh, I don't have a lot of \n\t\tstuff.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tI don't think my wife would \n\t\tdig it too much.\n\t\n\tShe moves to his ear to whisper.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBIKER GIRL\n\t\tMaybe we could just go find a \n\t\troom and fuck all day. You \n\t\twouldn't have to tell your \n\t\twife about that, would you? I \n\t\tcould suck you like this.\n\t\t\n\tAnd she begins sucking on his lobe. Behind them.

Inn the distance a coyote howls.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tYears ago, in LA, I turned a \n\t\ttrick on Sunset and Western. \n\t\tThe guy was polite and didn't \n\t\targue about the price. He \n\t\tparked his car and I took him \n\t\tto a house that I had an \n\t\tarrangement with. A fat \n\t\tMexican woman was watching a \n\t\tTV and I told him to give her \n\t\tthe twenty for the room. \n\t\tThere were three or four \n\t\tsmall naked children playing \n\t\ton the floor and we had to \n\t\tstep over them to get into \n\t\tthe room. The room had a bed \n\t\tand a dresser. He lay on his \n\t\tback on the bed and I put a \n\t\trubber on him and sucked him \n\t\tfor a while until he was hard \n\t\tand then I eased on to him. \n\t\tAbout twenty minutes later \n\t\tthere was a knock on the door \n\t\tand it was the woman saying \n\t\tour time was up. I felt kind \n\t\tof guilty because he hadn't \n\t\tcome and I offered to reason \n\t\twith the woman and get \n\t\tanother ten minutes, but he \n\t\tsaid it was all right and \n\t\tbegan dressing. When we were \n\t\tready to leave the room he \n\t\tstopped me and... hugged me \n\t\tand kissed me on the cheek. \n\t\tHe gave me an extra hundred \n\t\tas a tip and went back to his \n\t\tcar. I remember being \n\t\trelieved that I wouldn't have \n\t\tto work again that evening.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tLast spring I happened to \n\t\twalk past a house that I had \n\t\tonce patronized. There was a \n\t\tcool breeze blowing off the \n\t\tocean and through the window \n\t\tI could see a bare leg. The \n\t\tgirl must have been taking a \n\t\tbreak between customers. It \n\t\twas a strange moment for me \n\t\tbecause it reminded me of my \n\t\tmother and despite the fact \n\t\tthat I was late for something \n\t\talready I just stayed there, \n\t\tloving the atmosphere of it \n\t\tand my memory and... the \n\t\treason I'm telling you  this \n\t\tepilogue is that I felt that \n\t\tI'd come full circle.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tWhere was that house?

He \n\tlowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling \n\ta drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped \n\ttable. He is pretty loaded. Sera turns over and moves out of \n\this shadow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tI've missed the best sun. Why \n\t\tdid you have to pawn your \n\t\twatch?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI didn't know I'd ever need \n\t\tit again.\n\t\n\tSera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving \n\tboard. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the \n\tbathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive \n\tinto the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out \n\tnear Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends \n\tdown and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses \n\tback. There is no one else around the pool.\n\t\n\tThe kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, \n\tmaking him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down \n\tand kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, \n\tletting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. \n\tBen drinks from her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tTake this off.\n\t\n\tHe tries to pull her swimsuit down.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSERA\n\t\tMaybe we should go inside. \n\t\tCome on.\n\t\n\tShe stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, \n\tloses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls \n\tbackwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on \n\tto the glass table. The table goes over and it and the \n\tglasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken \n\tglass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass \n\tgoes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the \n\tsteaming cement.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhoops.\n\t\n\tSera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. She \n\tkneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of \n\tglass sticking to him. Ben stands unsteadily.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'll go and clean up. Perhaps \n\t\tyou could take care of this. \n\t\n\tHe indicates the mess, then walks to their room. Sera begins \n\tcarefully picking up the broken glass.

Ben puts all of his \n\twinnings on one bet and wins again. This pattern repeats a \n\tfew times and drinks are on the house.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBLONDE\n\t\tHey... that was quite a play. \n\t\tYou in for the convention?\n\t\n\tBen gets to the point.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI'd like to fuck you.\n\t\n\tA few people hear Ben and the Blonde is almost put off, but \n\the does have about eight thousand dollars in winnings and so \n\tshe leans in very close so that she can talk quietly.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBLONDE\n\t\tI'm very expensive.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHow much to lick your pussy?\n\t\n\tThe Blonde picks up a sizeable stack of chips and looks at \n\tBen.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\t121 INT.
