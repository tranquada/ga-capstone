The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level\n          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but\n          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.\n          \n          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the\n          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him.

We see his worktable for\n          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously\n          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor\n          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the\n          worktable.

We see him putting\n          something over his face (but only from behind).\n          \n          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,\n          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity\n          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.\n          \n          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.\n          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.\n          \n          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets\n          up and comes towards camera.\n          \n          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:\n          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks\n          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.\n          \n          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new\n          sort of energy.

WASTELAND - DAY\n          \n          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted\n          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.\n          \n          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered\n          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human\n          civilization surround him.\n          \n          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front\n          seat of a car.\n          \n          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on\n          them.\n          \n           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.\n          \n          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged\n          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and\n          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears\n          to be a dictator/leader.\n          \n          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.\n          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.\n          \n          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war\n          Machine.\n          \n           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.\n          \n          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a\n          piece of metal lying in front of him.\n          \n          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure\n          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him\n          with all his might.\n          \n          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2\n          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris\n          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.\n          \n                              2\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          A\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                    9.\n          \n          \n          But 2 is looking at 9 with surprise.   He struggles to get up,\n                               2\n          speaking with urgency to 9.\n          \n          \n                        (firmly, kindly, almost\n                         eagerly; like trying to\n                         soothe a wild animal)\n                    Wait...

I am a friend.\n          \n          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He\n          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his\n          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,\n          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to\n          help 2 up.\n          \n          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more\n          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of\n          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is\n          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.\n          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of\n          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.\n          \n          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see\n          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a\n          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.\n          \n          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on\n          his back.\n          \n                                (CONT'D)\n                        (eagerly, excited, like an\n                         intrigued scholar)\n                    Yes... yes... I always thought\n                    there'd be one more.\n          \n          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.\n          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding\n          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more\n          sophisticated than 2's.\n          \n                              2 (CONT'D)\n                    The details... how exciting.\n                        (FASCINATED)\n                    Carved wood... steel bolts...\n                    molded copper...\n          \n          H\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          9\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          2\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                     10.\n          \n          \n          2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.\n          But no sound comes out of his mouth.\n          \n            looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor.

He then\n          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged\n          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan.

But she is unable to move or speak\n          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked\n          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers\n          closer and closer to its prey.

It looks for a moment\n          as though 9 was wrong and they're all going to be killed.\n          They all cringe with horror.\n          \n          But then, as 9 had remembered, the Machine powers down to\n          \"digest\" 1's soul.\n          9\n              darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.\n          \n           he machine, with a terrible shrieking sound, falters, then\n          crumples, dead. Sparks and smoke spew from it. Oil bubbles\n          down its sides. It is lifeless--just a pile of jumbled\n          machinery.\n          \n          7 and the twins approach and all of them look down at the\n          Talisman in 9's hands and we:\n          \n                                                           DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          6\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          T\n          \n          \n          9\n          \n          \n          T\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          I\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                      76.\n          \n          \n          \n          ...........................................................\n          \n          SEQ. 240 - Souls Released, Life Renewed\n          \n          \n          SEQ. 240 - EXT.

He looks down at it in his hands and sadly places it\n          upon the pole, looking up towards it.\n          \n           he twins come in with artifacts from the Scientist's studio.\n          The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.\n          \n            and 7 take the Talisman and place it IN THE CENTER, in\n          front of the fire.\n          \n           he Talisman pulsates, vibrates, and shakes, and, finally\n          BURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and the\n          ragdolls' souls emerge.\n          \n          8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and the\n          twins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.\n          \n          2 comes out with 5 close behind.   5 places an arm around 2.\n          \n            emerges from the Talisman energy.   He sees his key and\n          caresses it.\n          \n          1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,\n          acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission.     He\n          looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.\n          \n          Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and\n          watch as the beam shoots up to the sky.
