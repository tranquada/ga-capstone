It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and\r\n          vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that\r\n          has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and\r\n          uncared for. However the \"For Sale\" on the lawn has a\r\n          \"Sold\" sign just beneath it.\r\n          The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still\r\n          SEARCHING for those voices.

The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for\r\n          the source of this new sound, much more interesting than\r\n          the old flick on the tube.\r\n          And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN,\r\n          two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the\r\n          bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both\r\n          as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They\r\n          twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy-\r\n          ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot\r\n          with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under\r\n          her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV.\r\n          The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the\r\n          interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the\r\n          centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now,\r\n          rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen\r\n          as CREDITS END.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           Rev. 11/16/84 4.\r\n\r\n<b>                         6 CONTINUED: (2)\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           PETER (V.0.)\r\n</b>          This is Peter Vincent, bringing you'\r\n          Fright Night Theatre.

Charley still sits in front of\r\n          his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost\r\n          in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open\r\n          window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake.\r\n          Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the\r\n          lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a\r\n          start.\r\n          There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the\r\n          room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair\r\n          stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her\r\n          blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe\r\n          what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to\r\n          the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps,\r\n          fumbling for his binoculars.\r\n          He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out\r\n          of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room\r\n          toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole\r\n          thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression\r\n          than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with\r\n          alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the\r\n          girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young\r\n          neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her.\r\n          As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear\r\n          his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to\r\n          pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor\r\n          sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight.\r\n          Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch\r\n          above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star-\r\n          ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's\r\n          bedroom.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          pk Rev. 11/16/84 15.\r\n\r\n<b>                          18 CONTINUED:\r\n</b>          It's almost as though he can see the boy watching him. -\r\n          With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into\r\n          the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively\r\n          reaching up to-protect his own throat.\r\n          Jerry Dandrige\u00e2\u0080\u00a2slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade,\r\n          cutting off all view into the room.\r\n          Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what\r\n          he just saw.

CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          Charley and Amy lay on his bed, making out like crazy,\r\n          the TV tuned in to Fright Night just as it was the first\r\n          evening we met them. They break for a moment as Peter\r\n          Vincent comes up on the screen.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          gr Rev. 11/25/84 103.\r\n\r\n<b>                          154 CONTINUED:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           PETER (V.0.)\r\n</b>          This is Peter Vincent, once more back\r\n          with you as host of Fright Night. I\r\n          thought I'd let the vampires rest for\r\n          a little while.\r\n          (winking into camera)\r\n          Right, Charley?\r\n          (back into his host\r\n\r\n<b>                         ROLE)\r\n</b>          Tonight the threat comes not from\r\n          beyond the grave, but from beyond the\r\n          stars as alien beings stalk an unwary\r\n          summer camp in \"MARS WANTS FLESH.\"\r\n\r\n<b>                         (PAUSE)\r\n</b>          I do not star in it.\r\n          Amy turns back to Charley, the two of them staring at each\r\n          other, obviously deeply in love. Then she slowly begins to\r\n          undress. Smiling he rises, inadvertently turning to his\r\n          window as he takes his shirt off, much as he did the first\r\n          night. He freezes.\r\n          There in Jerry's window, looking back at him, are a pair of\r\n          red glowing eyes. Charley blinks. He looks at the window\r\n          again. The eyes are gone...\r\n          Behind him, Amy looks at him questioningly.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AMY\r\n</b>          Charley, is something wrong?\r\n          With a quizzical shake of his head, Charley slams the\r\n          window shut and turns to her.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLEY\r\n</b>          No, nothing.\r\n          He jumps into bed with her,, the two of them beginning to\r\n          make- love as the CAMERA PANS off them to the window,\r\n          pushing out through the window closing in on Jerry's window\r\n          across the way. A pair of red eyes stand there in the\r\n          darkness, staring and staring as the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER\r\n          AND CLOSER. They blink; . they're for real; there is another\r\n          vampire out there and he is watching Charley.\r\n\r\n<b>          FADE OUT.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         THE END\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n \r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Fright-Night-(1985).jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Fright Night (1985)</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Tom Holland\" title=\"Scripts by Tom Holland\">Tom Holland</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Fright Night (1985) Script.html#comments\" title=\"Fright Night (1985) comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:48.534509"}
