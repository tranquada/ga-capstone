I live for one reason\n                    only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul\n                    Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about\n                    when I wake up, and he's what I'm\n                    thinking about when I close my eyes\n                    to sleep. If he told me to jump off\n                    a tall building, not only would I do\n                    it, I would hope to survive so I could\n                    do it again and again until he told me\n                    to stop. This is all I know. This is\n                    all I got. So please don't think I\n                    won't kill you, because I'd hate for\n                    your last thought to be a wrong one.\n                    You're going to that meeting.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                116.\n</b>\n<b>100B   INT.
