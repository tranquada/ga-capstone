A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the\n\tbedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to\n\ther bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they\n\twere still married.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tCharlie.

Standing on a chair she\n\treaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of\n\tPall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a\n\ttable lighter and flicks it.

You\n\t\treally changed the course of your\n\t\tdestiny.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tIt was an unfair fight. He didn't\n\t\thave a chance. I'm taking a real\n\t\tgamble. I loved him for a long,\n\t\tlong time.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tCheer up. Now you can give some\n\t\tother guy a shot.

This is not lost on Richard. Weird,\n\tguttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tIn the future, will you have to\n\t\tmarry a girl before you have sex\n\t\twith her?\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tNo. The Pill will change all that.\n\t\tThen he wouldn't have blamed me.

On the top of the pile is\n\tan open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release\n\tlever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress.

The group\n\tbegins to enter the main room.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\t\t(nervous)\n\t\tDo you have to wear that hat?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARNEY\n\t\tIt wouldn't be a lodge without\n\t\thats.\n\n\tBarney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly\n\tthrough the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARNEY\n\t\tDon't you worry. I'll be watching\n\t\tafter you.\n\n\tINT. LODGE \u0097 MAIN ROOM\n\n\tA large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit\n\twith fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold\u0097\n\tpainted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders,\n\twith lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front\n\tof the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an\n\tartificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look\n\tlike a set left over from a summer stock \"Macbeth\".\n\n\tPeggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from\n\tBarney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her\n\tshoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tHey, George. Get the lights.\n\n\tThe LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles.\n\n\tThe men form a semi\u0097circle around Peggy. Old men at the end\n\tof their lives, they are serious and passionate about the\n\tpossibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men\n\tfrom either end of the line approach the altar with\n\tofferings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose.\n\tThe men rejoin the line.\n\n\tLEO COOPER, a tall, white\u0097haired man, takes two steps\n\tforward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEO\n\t\t\t(to Peggy)\n\t\tAre you ready, dear?\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tYes, sir.\n\n\tLeo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tFasten your seat belts. Here we go.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEO\n\t\tLord of the Universe, Vast and\n\t\tMighty One. Ruler of Light, King\n\t\tof~ the sun. Creator of earth, air,\n\t\tfire and water.\n\t\t\t(kneeling down)\n\t\tWe adore thee and invoke thee!\n\t\tGrant thine aid.\n\t\tLook with favor upon us as we\n\t\twitness the regeneration of man. We\n\t\tbehold the innocent endeavors of\n\t\tsingle\u0097minded men and women. For we\n\t\tare the company of unbodied souls\n\t\tand immortal angels. We ask thy\n\t\tintervention, that this girl may\n\t\treturn to thee on the wings of your\n\t\tLove.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\t\t(sotto)\n\t\tThis is never going to work.\n\n\tThe old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to\n\tcircumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads\n\tbowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her.\n\tShe smiles back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEN\n\t\tFount of life, Chariot of the\n\t\tSpirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim\n\t\tthy child of light.\n\n\tWe HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The\n\tartificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with\n\tamazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men\n\tcontinue to chant while:\n\n\t\t\t\tLEO (O.S.)\n\t\tThe name of your love is sacrifice.\n\t\tWe offer up this girl, that her\n\t\tsoul may find its home.\n\n\tSuddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and\n\textinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEO (0.S.)\n\t\tNothing to worry about. Somebody\n\t\tget the lights.\n\n\tThe LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne.\n\n\tPeggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t(chipper)\n\t\tWell, the girl's gone. Let's play\n\t\tsome poker.\n\n\tCLOSE ON BARNEY \u0097 He smiles, happy that she made it. George\n\tcrosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a\n\tbutton. The wall slides open to reveal a fully\u0097equipped card\n\troom. The men shuffle in.\n\n\tEXT. BEHIND THE LODGE\n\n\tCharlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering\n\ther mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts\n\ther down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tWhat the hell did you do that for?\n\t\tWhat are you doing here?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI was trying to save you. They were\n\t\tgoing to vaporize you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tDon't be ridiculous! They're just a\n\t\tbunch of harmless old men. My\n\t\tgrandfather was in there.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou're going to listen to me.\n\n\tCharlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI'm not getting in that blue\n\t\tmonstrosity.\n\n\tCharlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie\n\ttakes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tLet me got! Where are you taking\n\t\tme?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tRight here. Now sit down.\n\n\tCharlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and\n\thopping mad.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tLook. I wanna tell you. I forgive\n\t\tyou for everything. I know what\n\t\tyou've been going through. You're\n\t\tjust scared. I was scared, too, but\n\t\tI'm not anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tHow could you possibly know what\n\t\tI've been going through?\n\n\tThunder and lightning. It starts to rain.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBecause I love you, damnit! I had a\n\t\tlong talk with your father\n\t\tyesterday and we decided that the\n\t\tbest thing for us to do is get\n\t\tmarried and settle down. Right\n\t\taway.\n\n\tPeggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tWhat do you mean you and my father\n\t\tdecided? Who the hell are you to\n\t\tplan my life? Let's get married and\n\t\tlive happily ever after. Bullshit.\n\t\tI got knocked up. I had to marry\n\t\tyou. I never had a choice.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tYou betrayed me, Charlie. You were\n\t\tnever there for me or the children.\n\t\tAnd now you come and tell me,\n\t\t\"Peggy, you're scared.\" Of course\n\t\tI'm scared. If you knew what I knew\n\t\tyou'd be scared shitless.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou're crazy! You're really out of\n\t\tyour mind!\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI might be crazy, but I'm not crazy\n\t\tenough to marry you twice. There's\n\t\ta lot of things I can't change. I\n\t\tcan't even think about them. I\n\t\ttried. But I couldn't even help\n\t\tRosalie.\n\t\t\t(tears start)\n\t\tI don't want to be bitter. I'm a\n\t\tnaturally optimistic person. But\n\t\tyou took advantage of that.\n\n\tCharlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy\n\tand strokes her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all\n\t\tmy fault. I'm so sorry. I won't\n\t\tbother you anymore. I promise.\n\t\tPlease stop crying. Please.\n\n\tPeggy starts to compose herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tWill you take me back to my\n\t\tgrandparents?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOf course.\n\n\tCharlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes\n\tout a small box, handing it to Peggy.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIt's almost your birthday. I wasn't\n\t\tsure when you were coming back, so\n\t\tI brought your present up here.\n\n\tWith a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside\n\tis the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\t\t(anguished)\n\t\tOh, Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIt opens, too. Look inside.\n\n\tPeggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition.\n\n\tINSERT - LOCKET\n\n\tTwo photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tScott and Beth. Where did you get\n\t\tthese?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARM E\n\t\tWho's Scott and Beth? Your mother\n\t\tgave me our picture. That's you and\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tSo are Scott and Beth.\n\n\tPeggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him,\n\tholding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their\n\tforeheads touching.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(tenderly)\n\t\tI love you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI know.\n\n\tCharlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the\n\tground. HOLD on the locket, and...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE:\n\n\tEXT. ON THE HILL - LATER\n\n\tCharlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash\n\tof lightning streaks across the sky.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI think we should get out of here.\n\t\tIt's going to rain.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\t\t(musing)\n\t\tDo you think anybody in the Fifties\n\t\tever made love on a bed?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat the hell is that?\n\n\tFlying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon\n\tkite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing\n\tlike a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.\n\n\tThe kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her\n\tfeet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to\n\tsail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tPeggy! Where're you going? Come\n\t\tback!\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI've got to go now.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBut I love you. I'll love you\n\t\tforever.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll\n\t\tlove you for twenty years.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tCome back to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tI'm trying.\n\n\tAs Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning\n\tstrikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run\n\toutside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy\n\tfloating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and\n\tblows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite\n\tcord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain\n\tthe runaway kite.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tRichard, do something!\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tI can't! It's out of control!\n\n\tSuddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tPeggy!\n\n\tCharlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and\n\tdipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's\n\tVOICE singing \"Peggy Sue\" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder\n\tat the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the\n\tblackness. In an instant she becomes a star.\n\n\tFINAL SCENE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE/OPTICAL\n\n\tHOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n\tMoving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the\n\tcake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect:\n\t'Your heart stopped for a while...\" Father's voice:\n\t'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of\n\tthe head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right\n\tnow, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so\n\tworried...\"\n\n\tEchoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting\n\topposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness.\n\tHe looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy\n\tSue' for her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t(singing softly).\n\t\tPeggy Sue, I love you, and I need\n\t\tyou Peggy Sue...\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tCharlie? Was I dead?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI thought you were...for a while.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\t\t(affectionately)\n\t\tYou look awful, like you haven't\n\t\tslept in days. And so old.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBut happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tCharlie, I thought I knew\n\t\teverything about you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI wanted to apologize. I can't live\n\t\twithout you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tWhat about Janet?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThat's over. I got tired of\n\t\ttranslating everything. She thought\n\t\tthe Big Hopper was a hamburger.\n\n\tCharlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her\n\thospital room.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tWho are all the flowers from?\n\n\tCharlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the\n\tdresser.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tEveryone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol\n\t\tand Walter. Richard Norvick.  And\n\t\there's a book, by that guy from\n\t\thigh school, Michael Fitzsimmons. \n\t\tHe dedicated it to you.\n\n\tCharlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover\n\tof the book.\n\n\tANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title \"The Pilgrim\n\tSoul\" and the dedication reads \"to Peggy Sue and a Starry\n\tNight\".\n\n\tPeggy smiles but shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tIt couldn't be me.  I hardly knew\n\t\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI'll just set it right here.\n\n\tHe places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tCharlie, I had a strange\n\t\texperience.  I went back to high\n\t\tschool. And I spent a lot of time\n\t\twith you.  And you and Walter and\n\t\tLeon were singing \"I Wonder Why\".\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOh, God, Dion.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tYou were terrific.  And I kept\n\t\ttrying to push you away but you\n\t\twouldn't give up.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI'll never give up.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tThen hold me.\n\n\tHe holds her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI loved you since the day I met\n\t\tyou, and I haven't stopped.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tDon't try to charm me, Charlie\n\t\tBodell.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tListen, I don't expect all the\n\t\ttroubles between us can just vanish\n\t\taway. But I would do what I can...\n\n\t\t\t\tPIGGY\n\t\tCharlie, please, I need some time.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell, I'll let you get some\n\t\trest...so long.\n\n\tThe VIEW PULLS BACK past the flowers. Charlie starts to exit.\n\tChecks himself in the mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEGGY\n\t\tCharlie, I would like to invite you\n\t\tto dinner at home, on Sunday, with\n\t\tyour kids. I will make a strudel.\n\n\tHe hurries back to her, kisses her again.\n\n\tThey hang on to each other as Beth enters the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT.\n  \n\nTHE END\n\n\n\u00a0\n              \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n PEGGY AND RICHARD SCENE\n\n\n\n\tTo be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the\n\tgoodbye to Richard scene.\n\n\tINT.
