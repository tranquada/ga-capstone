The lichen is on a rock. A   black lizard climbs over\r\n    the horizon - stalking flies.\r\n\r\n    A slow advance. A sudden rush. A fly is snapped up and\r\n    mashed between toothless gums.\r\n\r\n    The lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential\r\n    victim when...\r\n\r\n    A shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. A seabird grabs\r\n    the lizard in its claws. Death is sudden and bloody.\r\n\r\n    The bird settles to eat.\r\n\r\n    Whizz...Thunk. A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and\r\n    impales the bird through its wing.\r\n\r\n    The wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping\r\n    helplessly.\r\n\r\n    The rest of the flock take to their air, calling and\r\n    wheeling as...\r\n\r\n    A crowd of local savages come racing over the larger\r\n    horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows,\r\n    spears, rocks and throwing-sticks...\r\n\r\n    A child grabs the injured bird and kills it.\r\n\r\n    An adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird.\r\n\r\n    The rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting\r\n    each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock\r\n    of birds.\r\n\r\n    AND WE CUT TO\r\n                                                              2\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT.

A small boat is lowered.\r\n\r\n                        DARWIN\r\n              One day, Captain Fitzroy went\r\n              ashore to meet them.\r\n\r\n    The slow rhythm of the oars.\r\n\r\n    Sailors and savages clutch their weapons, watching each\r\n    other in breathless anticipation.\r\n                                                           3\r\n\r\n\r\n5   INT.

The Crunch crunch of their\r\nfeet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod\r\nwalking stick.\r\n\r\n                    HUXLEY\r\n          We intend to reclaim science as a\r\n          profession - wrest it away from\r\n          the country parsons and beetle-\r\n          collectors. Your book will be our\r\n          rallying point.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN.\r\n          You know it is not yet any fit\r\n          state to publish.\r\n\r\n                    HUXLEY\r\n          I have read your detailed\r\n          abstract. The argument is\r\n          complete and utterly compelling.\r\n          All that is lacking is the detail\r\n          and we know you have that in\r\n          abundance. Your barnacle work has\r\n          established you as the pre-\r\n          eminent authority on marine life.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN.\r\n          On one small mollusc!\r\n\r\n                     HOOKER\r\n          In which the whole story of\r\n          creation can be read.

But that is\r\n          the very point. If we but had the\r\n          complete fossil record we could\r\n          trace all life back to one speck\r\n          of protoplasm. The branching of\r\n          forms in ever more complex\r\n          succession...until.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN.\r\n          Yes yes, but one cannot infer too\r\n          much.\r\n                                                      25\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          Mr Darwin. Either you are being\r\n          disingenuous or you do not fully\r\n          understand you own\r\n          accomplishment.

Joseph\r\n          Hooker we know is too nice a chap\r\n          to do it. You are a fine and\r\n          brilliant man who hates to give\r\n          offence - an admirable quality -\r\n          wish I had it myself. But what do\r\n          we believe? What do we know to be\r\n          true. Will you light the way or\r\n          leave us all to flounder in the\r\n          mire for another decade.\r\n\r\nHe stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched.\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          Are you alright?\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN.\r\n          A touch of indigestion. It will\r\n          pass.\r\n\r\nIts clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be\r\ndistracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him\r\ntil the worst of it passes.\r\n\r\n                    HUXLEY\r\n          It is time to write your book Mr\r\n          Darwin. Write it brilliantly as\r\n          we all know you can. Strike hard\r\n          and fast with a blow that is\r\n          utterly conclusive.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n              (in pain)\r\n          Sir, you are talking like a\r\n          revolutionary and really...\r\n\r\n                    HUXLEY\r\n          It is a revolution.

The air loud\r\n     with laughter and thick with pipe smoke.\r\n\r\n     Clodhoppers crowd the snug, many of them roaring drunk,\r\n     with their florid complexions, stained and broken teeth.\r\n\r\n     Darwin trying, to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of\r\n     locals who hail him and gather around him, wedging him into\r\n     a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter.\r\n\r\n                         THATCHER\r\n               Mr Darwin! Mr Darwin! I was\r\n               explaining to Mr Goodman here\r\n               your interest in breeding. Mr\r\n               Darwin is our foremost scholar in\r\n               the village.\r\n\r\n                         DARWIN\r\n               No. No I am but one of many.\r\n               There is Squire Lubbock, and the\r\n               reverend Innes\r\n\r\n     The Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents.\r\n\r\n                         THATCHER\r\n               ....he is also a noted explorer,\r\n               the author of many books..\r\n\r\n                         DARWIN\r\n               ...which no-one has read.\r\n                                                              55\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THATCHER\r\n               ...a fellow of the Royal society\r\n               and a prodigious expert on\r\n               clams...oysters?\r\n\r\n                            DARWIN\r\n               Barnacles.\r\n\r\n                         THATCHER\r\n               Mr Goodman, now, is the foremost\r\n               pigeon fancier in all the\r\n               southern counties.

The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk.\r\n\r\n     Behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the\r\n     birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches\r\n     have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass\r\n     case. They flutter, frenzied, tapping with their beaks on\r\n     the inside of the glass, which shatters as...\r\n\r\n     One by one the bottled specimens explode, discharging their\r\n     contents onto the floor.\r\n\r\n     A lamp falls over.

Mrs Darwin, it is nothing but\r\n                                         chloride of mercury.

There's a covering letter and a\r\n      twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden\r\n      loud bellow of laughter.\r\n\r\n                           DARWIN\r\n                Ha!!\r\n\r\n\r\n102   EXT.

What a\r\n          beautiful postage stamp.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n          Yes. It is from the Spice\r\n          islands.\r\n\r\n                    INNES\r\n          I do rather envy your wide circle\r\n          of correspondents. In my youth I\r\n          always wanted to travel.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n          You are still young.

My\r\n          correspondent In the spice\r\n          islands has arrived independently\r\n          at exactly the same idea,\r\n          expressed in a mere twenty pages.\r\n                    (MORE)\r\n                                                      61\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN (cont'd)\r\n          There's brevity for you.

I was\r\n          reflecting only the other day on\r\n          the fact that he has endowed us\r\n          in his blessed generosity with\r\n          not one but nine hundred species\r\n          of intestinal worm each with its\r\n          own unique method of infiltrating\r\n          the blood supply and burrowing\r\n          through the mucosa.\r\n\r\nInnes shifts uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n           And then again on the great love\r\n          he shows for butterflies by\r\n          inventing a wasp to lay eggs\r\n          inside the living flesh of\r\n          caterpillars\r\n\r\n                    INNES\r\n          Well. It is not for us to guess\r\n          at His reasons.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n          No. We can leave that for Mr\r\n          Wallace now. Should I advise him\r\n          to stay overseas do you think? If\r\n          he shows his face in Kent he may\r\n          be required to kneel on rock\r\n          salt.\r\n\r\nInnes rises. He's a short man, acutely aware of any threats\r\nto his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery\r\n\r\n                    INNES\r\n          I once valued our friendship Mr\r\n          Darwin. I had hoped it might be\r\n          possible to restore it. Clearly\r\n          in your present mood that is not\r\n          going to be possible. My regards\r\n          to Mrs Darwin\r\n\r\nHe starts off round the corner of the house.\r\n                                                            62\r\n\r\n\r\n      Darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his\r\n      face back to the sun. When he opens his eyes sees a figure\r\n      standing in the lawn.\r\n\r\n      It is Annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.\r\n\r\n                           DARWIN\r\n                What? I am forestalled by Mr\r\n                Wallace. That is the simple fact\r\n                of it. What reason do you have to\r\n                be angry?!\r\n\r\n      She shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him\r\n      and runs off towards the meadow.\r\n\r\n      Darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries\r\n      after her.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Annie!\r\n\r\n      He reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden\r\n      intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and\r\n      fells him to his knees.\r\n\r\n      He lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of\r\n      the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to\r\n      the wind.\r\n\r\n      A view from high above: spiralling downwards on the Darwin\r\n      garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters\r\n      and hurry to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY.                    103\r\n\r\n      There are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the\r\n      bedroom ceiling. Like lichen on a rock. Like an archipelago\r\n      of islands.\r\n\r\n      Darwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of\r\n      white blankets.\r\n\r\n      The door opens and he turns his head. Its Emma.\r\n\r\n                          EMMA\r\n                You have a visitor.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                No. No. I will not be bled or\r\n                lectured to.\r\n\r\n      She gives him a pinched look, then Hooker pushes in behind\r\n      her.\r\n                                                        63\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          It is me.

Did you read the\r\n          Wallace abstract.\r\n\r\nHooker bats the idea away\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          It is a letter. You have a book\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n          ...barely half of it\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          You have a book. What is not\r\n          already on the page is most\r\n          certainly inside your head and I\r\n          intend to extract it, if it kills\r\n          us both.\r\n\r\n                    DARWIN\r\n          You have been talking to Huxley.\r\n\r\n                     HOOKER\r\n          No. Had I done so he would have\r\n          hastened here himself armed with\r\n          every instrument of torture known\r\n          to her majesty's navy.\r\n              (Then)\r\n          Charles I have read the first\r\n          Chapters.

All my old\r\n          symptoms have returned with a\r\n          vengeance. The sweats the shakes\r\n          the abdominal pains. The whole\r\n          endeavour was cursed from the\r\n          outset.\r\n\r\nHooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from\r\ntrembling\r\n\r\n                    HOOKER\r\n          Charles. It was you who opened my\r\n          eyes to the wonders of science.\r\n          So let me open yours. You have an\r\n          illness. You have had it as long\r\n          as I have known you.\r\n                    (MORE)\r\n                                                               64\r\n\r\n                          HOOKER (cont'd)\r\n                It is clearly made worse in times\r\n                of overwork but the nature of the\r\n                work is irrelevant. This is not\r\n                visited on you by God or the\r\n                devil. This is a set of physical\r\n                symptoms.

What is there to be\r\n                scared of there. He has worked\r\n                for you in the past it will work\r\n                again. Then come back and finish\r\n                the book. Your enemies are\r\n                already toasting their good\r\n                fortune but they shall not\r\n                prevail.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                What are you talking about. I\r\n                have no enemies.\r\n\r\n                           HOOKER\r\n                They are legion, believe me, and\r\n                they are implacable. We are all\r\n                of us fighting a battle against\r\n                fear and superstition but we can\r\n                win this battle. We must win it.\r\n                You can win it for all of us. Go\r\n                to malvern, then come back and\r\n                finish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n104   INT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST.

Darwin, looking weak but purged, sits\r\n      on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral\r\n      water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and\r\n      valleys of Malvern.\r\n\r\n      Gully sits with him, interviewing him.\r\n\r\n                          GULLY\r\n                What action do you most associate\r\n                with the symptoms.

Nervous\r\nfibres exist after all throughout\r\nthe whole body. Is it not\r\npossible that certain primal\r\nfeelings manifest in some\r\nphysical way. Eczema. Boils. A\r\nfever. Might some blocked passion\r\nimitate a gall-stone? Or even\r\nmanufacture one.\r\n\r\n          DARWIN\r\nWell, until someone devises a\r\nmachine to read nervous impulses,\r\nor a telescope to look inside\r\nthe body I suppose we can only\r\nguess at it.\r\n\r\n          GULLY\r\nWe can Mr Darwin.

A substantial terraced house.\r\n\r\n      Darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front\r\n      door, and rings the bell.\r\n\r\n      As he waits for an answer a woman appears, unseen in the\r\n      rain streaked window above, observing him.\r\n\r\n      Darwin rings again.

Various fringed lamp-shades, a dancing Shiva,\r\n      a framed picture of Lourdes, and some illustrations from\r\n      the Tarot.

Then a man answers from within.\r\n\r\n                          LANDLORD (O.S.)\r\n                Hello?\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Is Mrs Carey still the landlady\r\n                here.\r\n\r\n                          LANDLORD\r\n                No.\r\n\r\n      The door opens on a chain.\r\n                                                            77\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                My daughter Annie ...lodged here\r\n                some years ago. Can I come in?\r\n\r\n      The man closes the door to release the chain, then opens it\r\n      again to admit Darwin.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                I know this is an intrusion. I\r\n                wonder - could I visit the room\r\n                she stayed in?\r\n\r\n      The landlord doesn't know what to make of this\r\n\r\n                          LANDLORD\r\n                Wait here. I'll get the missus.\r\n\r\n      He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and\r\n      consults with his wife in the lighted parlour.\r\n\r\n      Darwin looks around. This place is all too familiar to him -\r\n      the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror, the carved mock-Tudor coat-\r\n      stand.\r\n\r\n      Muffled conversation off.\r\n\r\n      There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas.\r\n      Lavender potpourri in a brass dish. A wheel-chair in one\r\n      corner, a picture of the pieta above the door.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the land-lady emerges from    her parlour.\r\n\r\n                          LANDLADY\r\n                Which room?\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Fourteen. I would only be there\r\n                ten minutes. I am happy to pay.\r\n\r\n      She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key.\r\n\r\n                          LANDLADY\r\n                Up one flight and along the\r\n                corridor to the right.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                I remember.\r\n\r\n                          LANDLADY\r\n                Try not to touch anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n126   INT.

A maid is bundling soiled\r\n      sheets. Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully.\r\n\r\n      They turn as he enters.\r\n\r\n      Annie lies on the bed between them, her breathing fast and\r\n      shallow. She manages a weak smile.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Is she any better? Does she want\r\n                for anything?\r\n\r\n      Gully stands up from the bed. His expression tells us hope\r\n      is fading. Annie's pale sunken cheeks and caked lips\r\n      confirm it.\r\n\r\n      Darwin kneels by her bedside, clasps her little hand is his\r\n      own.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Darling Annie. I am here now.\r\n\r\n      Annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes\r\n      his lapel \"making him beautiful\"\r\n\r\n      Brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n132   INT.

I think it best for\r\n                you to know how every hour\r\n                passes. It's a relief for me to\r\n                tell you. Whilst writing to you I\r\n                can cry tranquilly.\r\n\r\n\r\n133   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST DAY.                                  133\r\n\r\n      A local surgeon lays out various instruments, including a\r\n      glass syringe with a long needle.\r\n\r\n      Annie struggles and whimpers. Brodie comforts her\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN (V.O.)\r\n                Mr Coates the Surgeon came today\r\n                to draw off Annie's water. This\r\n                did not hurt her, but she\r\n                struggled with surprising\r\n                strength against being uncovered.\r\n\r\n                          BRODIE\r\n                There there.

I will believe\r\n                whatever. Forever. Please save\r\n                her\r\n\r\n      He looks up at the image of Christ on the cross, hoping\r\n      against all reason, for some sense of epiphany.\r\n\r\n      It's not working. He feels nothing embarrassment at the\r\n      cheapness of the gesture.\r\n\r\n\r\n136   INT GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14.

She talked a great\r\n                deal but we could seldom make out\r\n                anything. Much of what she says\r\n                we cannot make out from the\r\n                roughness of her poor mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n137   INT. GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14 NIGHT                             137\r\n\r\n      Dr Gully leaves, the surgeon arrives. The maids squeeze\r\n      between the two medical men, bundling sheets\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN (V.O.)\r\n                Today she vomited rather much\r\n                again. Dr Coates has been to draw\r\n                off more water.\r\n\r\n      Brodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the\r\n      tail of her shirt, then roll her on her back again, with a\r\n      pillow between her two bony knees.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Is that good, my lovely\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                    (suddenly lucid)\r\n                Beautifully good.

Each breath seems like it will be her\r\n      last.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly she speaks: faintly but audibly:\r\n                                                               81\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                The rabbit.\r\n\r\n                           DARWIN\r\n                What?\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                The rabbit taught him the polka.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                I don't understand my love.\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                Tell me about Jenny.\r\n\r\n      Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                What about her.\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                When she died\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                I don't want to talk about death\r\n                my love.\r\n\r\n                          ANNIE\r\n                But tell me.

When she was very sick with\r\n                pneumonia, lying very still, he\r\n                tried to feed her but she shook\r\n                her head, looking at him as\r\n                though to say: \"Its nice of you\r\n                but really you shouldn't bother\".\r\n                And as he bent down to take the\r\n                spoon away she brought her arms\r\n                around his neck and kissed him.\r\n                And then she was dead.\r\n\r\n      Annie smiles, puts her hands around her fathers neck and\r\n      dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n140   INT.

Darwin crosses the lawn to her.\r\n      She's burning leaves and dead-heads from the flower garden.\r\n\r\n                          DARWIN\r\n                Did you read it?\r\n\r\n                             EMMA\r\n                Yes.\r\n\r\n                             DARWIN\r\n                And....\r\n\r\n                          EMMA\r\n                I wrapped it and put it on the\r\n                table there.\r\n\r\n      There's a brown paper parcel on the garden table where they\r\n      like to sit under the big Cyprus tree.\r\n\r\n      Darwin picks it up, it is addressed to John Murray,\r\n      Publisher, stamped and sealed with sealing wax.\r\n\r\n                          EMMA\r\n                You're right. True or not it must\r\n                all be said. Probably most of it\r\n                is true. God help us.\r\n\r\n      Darwin kisses her.\r\n                                                            92\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EMMA\r\n                Careful.

Who knows\r\n                if anyone will buy it and how\r\n                they will respond. No doubt many\r\n                will wish al diabolo altogether.\r\n                But least it is out in the world\r\n                now and no longer torturing me.\r\n\r\n      John Griffiths, the postman, comes up the hill from the\r\n      village.\r\n\r\n      Darwin gives him the manuscript. The Postman puts it in his\r\n      satchel and heads on up the lane.\r\n\r\n      Darwin turns back and walks up towards the house.\r\n\r\n      As he does so a little figure, Annie takes his hand, and\r\n      together they continue on home, Annie skipping happily by\r\n      her father's side.\r\n\r\n\r\n172   POST-SCRIPT.                                                172\r\n\r\n      Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" was sold out on its day of\r\n      publication.\r\n\r\n      A classic to this day, it was reprinted six times before\r\n      his death; and his burial, with full Christian honours, in\r\n      Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE END\r\n\n\n\n\nCreation\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Collee\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:13.638173"}
