And another before encountering and being \"blocked\"\n      by an empty wheelchair. She stops.\n      Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her\n      path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the\n      fountain before mysteriously stopping again.\n      Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers\n      in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the\n      fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her.\n      Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another \"ghost\"\n      (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive.\n      \"At\" Sayer.\n\n    27.
