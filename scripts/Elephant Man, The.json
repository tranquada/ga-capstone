The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and \n               back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, \n               where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on \n               anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to \n               us observing the posters of the freaks.\n\n               Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is \n               Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over-\n               whelming music seems to engulf her.\n\n               She looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her \n               daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing \n               their chocolate sweets.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster.\n\n               He hears:\n\n<b>                                     #1 DAUGHTER\n</b>                         Poppa!\n\n               Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He \n               smiles at the children and Anne.\n\n               Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. \n               The other daughter looks into the freak tent.\n\n<b>                                     #2 DAUGHTER\n</b>                         Poppa... may we go in there?\n\n<b>                                     ANNE\n</b>                         Alright...

He pauses to pay admission \n               at a small booth, then disappears within.\n\n               DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant.\n\n               Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of \n               the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black \n               cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully \n               into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. \n               People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' \n               right, he sees a sign reading, \"The Deadly Fruit of the \n               Original Sin,\" over a small, very dark corridor.\n\n               Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows.\n\n               The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient \n               the spectator.\n\n               Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the \n               inner chamber.\n\n               In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, \n               with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar \n               filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an \n               eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the \n               life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a \n               large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of \n               unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but \n               the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the \n               jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of \n               it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious \n               triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and \n               the tree flowering over the jar.\n\n               Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He \n               studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage \n               we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems \n               visibly impressed with \"The Deadly Fruit of the Original \n               Sin.\"\n\n<b>                                     OLDER MAN\n</b>                         A wicked birth...\n\n               After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber.\n\n               As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows \n               and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears \n               a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve \n               candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out \n               by \"THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN.\" His BARKER steps up and talks \n               to the people.\n\n<b>                                     BARKER\n</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are \n                         larger than this mammoth blacksmith's \n                         bellows. So great is his power of \n                         exhalation, rivaling even that of \n                         the Great North Wind, that he will \n                         now challenge two grown men to attempt \n                         to hold the bellows shut as he applies \n                         the mighty blast of his herculean \n                         breath! Are there any volunteers?\n\n               A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd \n               and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN \n               toward the back.\n\n<b>                                     BARKER\n</b>                         Ah!

Let the \n                         demonstration begin!!\n\n               The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great \n               show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two \n               Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart.\n\n               The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind-\n               Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and \n               the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.\n\n<b>                                     BARKER\n</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen!... \"THE \n<b>                         INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!\n</b>\n               The crowd cheers, while the Wind-Man puts the conch shell to \n               his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the Two \n               Lads.\n\n               Amidst this applause, Treves smiles indulgently. He moves \n               on, looking for something genuine.\n\n               TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd, intent upon a certain \n               destination. Treves conveys a casual interest in them.\n\n               Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard, busily \n               chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon.\n\n               Treves continues to work his way through the crowd. Up ahead \n               he sees the Bobbies.\n\n<b>                                     BOBBIES\n</b>                         Make way!

They are dressed as babies. \n               A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.\n\n<b>                                     SKELETON MAN\n</b>                         I refuse to believe it!

They should not allow it!\n\n               Treves, very curious now, along with several others, make \n               their way around the corner.\n\n               Before him, Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something \n               that from his point of view he cannot see. Brushing past him \n               is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE \n               GIRL. Getting closer to the commotion, he sees four BOBBIES \n               standing with a well-dressed alderman, arguing with the OWNER \n               of this particular exhibit.\n\n               A distraught, almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectually \n               striking the Owner with her fists about his head and \n               shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         Beast, Beast...\n\n               Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing \n               the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:\n\n<b>                                     BOBBY\n</b>                         No! That's right out! Drop the \n                         curtain!\n\n               As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser \n               cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The \n               distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is \n               sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         You can't do that!

Treves pushes through the glut of \n               people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is \n               actually a large canvas.\n\n               On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature \n               that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure \n               of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, \n               however, is not complete; there is still more of the man \n               than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle \n               habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed.\n\n               Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.\n\n<b>                                     ALDERMAN\n</b>                         This exhibit degrades all who see \n                         it, as well as the poor creature \n                         himself.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         He's a freak!

No one objects \n                         to freaks, but this is entirely \n                         different. This is monstrous, and \n                         ought not to be allowed.

We hear moaning in the background. The coals \n               flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude \n               the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded \n               in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist-\n               high operating table covered with black leather. His face is \n               illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse.\n\n               The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky \n               seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a \n               cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and \n               other unattractive things, and two hard chairs.\n\n               TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, \n               are present. The two Students are pulling with constant \n               pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. \n               Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. \n               There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as \n               they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask \n               over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of \n               chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside \n               and he is unconscious.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         How long has this man been here?\n\n<b>                                     FOX\n</b>                         Three quarters of an hour.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Mmmm.

In those days we didn't \n                         even wash our coats. In fact, the \n                         sign of a truly accomplished surgeon--\n                         was his black operating coat, so \n                         stiff with dried blood and pus that \n                         it could stand up by itself in the \n                         corner.

He stops and looks into \n               an operating room much like the one we have just seen.\n\n               Inside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and \n               continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move \n               with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is \n               draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be \n               heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes \n               the door and continues on his way.\n\n<b>               TREVES' OPERATING ROOM\n</b>\n               There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of \n               the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient \n               is being held down firmly by the other men.\n\n               The door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head \n               in.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Yes?\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         I found it.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                              (studying the Boy \n                              carefully)\n                         Did you see it?\n\n               The Boy shakes his head slowly, \"No.\"\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         I'll be with you in a moment ...\n\n               The Boy closes the door.\n\n<b>                                     FOX\n</b>                              (quietly)\n                         I say Freddie, what are you about?\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Oh nothing... nothing of any great \n                         importance.\n\n               AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking \n               down on the hospital square.\n\n               Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through \n               a gate and into the slums beyond.\n\n               The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox \n               filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window.\n\n               Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow \n               Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a \n               recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. \n               The air is smoky from meat burning fires.\n\n               Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas \n               sign of \"The Elephant Man\" covering the front of a small, \n               dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. \n               Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a \n               moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked.\n\n               Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his \n               left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Do you know where the proprietor is?\n\n               He holds a coin out. The Boy nods, snatches the coin and \n               then disappears around the corner.\n\n               Treves turns back to the canvas.\n\n<b>               A PUB\n</b>\n               A noisy pub, long and narrow. Benches run the length of the \n               back wall, with small tables up against them. Men are \n               clustered around the bar, talking in groups.\n\n               We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to the \n               Owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. The Boy \n               gestures outside.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE THE PUB\n</b>\n               The Boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the Owner \n               hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, \n               the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.\n\n<b>               AT THE CORNER\n</b>\n               The Boy and the Owner are carefully looking around the corner \n               at Treves still in front of the portrait.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         He's not a peeler...\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         No, I don't think so.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         No...

The door opens and light streams in. The canvas \n               covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all \n               other light. The Owner enters, followed by Treves and the \n               Boy. From his expression, as well as Treves', we can tell \n               there must be an awful stench in the room. No one says a \n               word. The Boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small \n               gas light. We can now see the shop. It it empty, grey with \n               dust, cold and dank. Some old tins and a few shriveled \n               potatoes occupy a shelf. The far end of the shop is blocked \n               off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings.\n\n               The Owner approaches it.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         Here we are sir.\n                              (ticking it off by \n                              rote)\n                         Life is full of surprises. Ladies \n                         and gentlemen, consider the fate of \n                         this creature's poor mother. In the \n                         fourth month of her maternal \n                         condition, she was struck down by a \n                         wild elephant\n                              (leering)\n                         Struck down, if you take my meaning, \n                         on an uncharted African isle. The \n                         result is plain to see ladies and \n                         gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT \n<b>                         MAN!\n</b>\n               The rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. We see a \n               bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. \n               In front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from \n               below by a bunsen burner. From the blanket protrudes a \n               perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the \n               brick.\n\n               It does not move when the curtain is drawn.\n\n               Treves steps closer. The Owner, watching his every move, \n               turns-and smiles at him. He bangs his riding crop on the \n               wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a \n               dog.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         Stand up!\n\n               The Boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the Owner.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         Stand up!\n\n               The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the \n               ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself.\n\n               Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen \n               open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self \n               preservation.\n\n               The Owner laughs.\n\n               The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare \n               and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress \n               suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter \n               from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and \n               misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow \n               projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. \n               His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its \n               position.\n\n               From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding \n               from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside \n               out, making a slobbering aperture.\n\n               It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or \n               tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. \n               At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling \n               cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang \n               down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous \n               and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His \n               left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with \n               fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his \n               chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard.\n\n               His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. \n               Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely \n               constructed palm trees.\n\n               The Owner harshly raps again.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         Turn around!\n\n               The Elephant Man begins to turn. The boy filled with malicious \n               glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         Turn around! Turn around!\n\n               The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest.\n\n               We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His \n               face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression.\n\n               We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE THE SHOP\n</b>\n               The Owner is locking up.\n\n               Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is \n               trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus.\n\n               He looks at the garish portrait again.\n\n               Treves produces his purse.\n\n               The Owner, smelling money, turns.\n\n               Treves hands him several coins.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, \n                         10:00 a.m.?

The Owner, greasy and dirty, \n               shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         Now we got a deal...

We understand \n                         each other completely.\n\n               The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator.\n\n               Treves walks off, disoriented.\n\n               The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away \n               down the street.\n\n<b>               DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP\n</b>\n               A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the \n               portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length \n               black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to \n               the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs \n               from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his \n               face.\n\n               There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the \n               figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of \n               the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes \n               from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick.\n\n               The figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just \n               barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one \n               side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the \n               Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view.\n\n<b>                                     OWNER\n</b>                         Don't just stand there. Help him up.\n\n               The Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The \n               Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto \n               the seat and off they go.\n\n<b>               THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL\n</b>\n               The receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It \n               has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, \n               and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, \n               harsh place.\n\n<b>                                     CABMAN\n</b>                         Not at all, sir.

Treves looks at the figure for a moment.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Come with me, please.\n\n               He starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands \n               there, motionless.\n\n               We see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare \n               at the figure.\n\n               No one makes a move.\n\n<b>                                     MATRON\n</b>                         You heard the doctor... Go on.\n\n               Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a \n               moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and \n               the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, \n               they all begin to talk excitedly.\n\n               Mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy \n               room.\n\n<b>               TREVES' OFFICE\n</b>\n               The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair \n               in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively \n               trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small \n               room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming.\n\n               Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries \n               to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         My name is Frederick Treves...

His \n               sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a \n               moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Ah... yes.

Treves sits down at his desk and \n               picks up a pencil.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner... \n                         um, the man who... who looks after \n                         you tells me that you are English \n                         and your name is John Merrick.

Do you understand?\n\n               The figure following Treves' movements nods very slowly, \n               \"yes\". Treves sighs with relief.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Are you in any pain?\n\n               The figure begins to babble incoherently. Treves, alarmed, \n               interrupts.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Um, no. Just nod your head like this \n                         for \"yes\" and shake it like this for \n                         \"no\". Now, are you in any pain?\n\n               Again the figure, following Treves movements, shakes his \n               head \"no\".\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Are your parents still alive?\n\n               The figure does nothing. Treves is quite nervous.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Do you understand? Are they dead? \n                         Your father... your mother?\n\n               The figure begins to moan. There are two sharp raps at the \n               door. The hooded figure flinches.\n\n               The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room.\n\n<b>                                     FOX\n</b>                         Freddie, what you doing for...

I think I'll have me a look at \n                         that.\n\n               Suddenly the Night Porter kicks the other bucket of filthy \n               water violently, sending it splashing all over the young \n               Porter.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         Now, you need the scrubbing, ducks!\n\n               He lets his cigarette drop to the ground, then stamps and \n               grinds it with his brass-heeled boot, all the while smiling. \n               Then he turns on his heel and leaves.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n               Dark clouds rolling through an evening sky.\n\n<b>               ATTIC WARD\n</b>\n               Through the high barred window, we see the dark sky. The \n               E.M. is on his bed in his sleeping posture. A dim gaslight \n               burns in the room.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of his head on the points of his knees. His breathing \n               is more regular now.\n\n<b>               A GENERAL WARD\n</b>\n               Lights are being turned off.\n\n<b>               ANOTHER WARD\n</b>\n               Lights go off.\n\n<b>               BACK ENTRANCE\n</b>\n               Large iron door is closed.\n\n<b>               HALLWAY\n</b>\n               Half the lights go off.\n\n<b>               HALLWAY\n</b>\n               Nurses leave for their quarters - half the lights go off.\n\n<b>               SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY\n</b>\n               We hear the slow metallic footfalls of the Night Porter's \n               boots. He appears and walks into a darkened women's ward. \n               The women are all asleep. Some coughing fitfully, others \n               moaning quietly. The Night Porter walks down the aisle between \n               the beds. We see several of the sleeping women as he passes \n               them. Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes \n               wide open, watching him with intense fear. On either side of \n               her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply. The young \n               woman has her arms tied, suspended in traction above her. \n               The Night Porter moves to her, his shadow engulfing her.\n\n               She starts to move, rattling the apparatus above her. The \n               Porter puts a finger to his lips.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         Hush, love, I told you before one \n                         word from me, they'll toss you back \n                         on the street, and then those pretty \n                         little arms of yours will never grow \n                         straight. Now close your eyes.\n\n               She turns her head away, closing her eyes. He moves in.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of a gas light in a hallway.

We hear again the metallic \n               footfalls of the Night Porter's boots, and he appears. He \n               goes to the narrow stairway marked, \"Isolation\".\n\n               He stops and casually looks about. He takes a swig of his \n               gin, then starts up the stairs.\n\n<b>               ATTIC WARD\n</b>\n               Merrick as before the light is very dim. We hear the echoing \n               footfalls of the Night Porter coming up the stairs. Merrick's \n               head immediately comes up from his knees. As it does, a small \n               object falls from where his head rested.\n\n               He picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is \n               the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his \n               dream.\n\n               Suddenly the door swings open and the Night Porter, bottle \n               in hand, is standing there.

The Night Porter, hardly able to believe \n               his eyes, moves slowly toward Merrick. He is afraid but as \n               he reaches the bed, Merrick flinches back. The Night Porter \n               grins, his fear gone now. He is in control.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         So this is the Elephant Man.

I likes people what can keep \n                         quiet.\n\n               He offers Merrick his bottle with a swift, almost jabbing \n               motion. Merrick pulls away from him.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         Like a drink? Go on... Go on have \n                         some. No? You should try being more \n                         sociable, mate.\n\n               He tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against \n               the hanging growth on Merrick's chest. Encouraged, he touches \n               him with his fingers. Merrick makes a small whimpering sound.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                              (grinning)\n                         You and I are going to be good \n                         friends, we are.

In the bed, Merrick \n               looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the \n               Night Porter recede down the stairs.\n\n<b>               WHITECHAPEL ROAD\n</b>\n               We see a horse's head in CU, snorting steam into the chill \n               morning air. The horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked \n               in front of the London. Through the open back of the wagon \n               we see the MILKMAN, and past him Treves, walking towards us.\n\n<b>                                     MILKMAN\n</b>                         Here early again, eh Mr. Treves?

Over his \n               shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. As the door \n               swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. \n               The lamp is still burning, but Merrick is nowhere to be seen. \n               Treves enters, looking about for him.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Mr. Merrick?\n\n               There's movement in the corner beside the bed. Merrick rises \n               slightly from the shadow. The light from the lamp hits his \n               frightened eyes.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         ....Good morning... John.

Treves enters the room, placing \n               the bowl on the table and going to Merrick.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         What are you doing down there?

Come up from there.\n\n               He starts to help Merrick up, but Merrick just presses himself \n               farther back in the corner, still babbling. There are two \n               raps at the door. Treves goes to it and lets Mothershead in.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD\n</b>                         Good morning, Mr. Treves.

I expect that's what \n                         drives him under the bed. We must \n                         use patience and understanding with \n                         this man.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD\n</b>                         Perhaps you've got the time for that, \n                         Mr. Treves, I certainly don't.

Merrick watches the door close. He \n               sighs quietly, looks about, and sees the Bible on the bedside \n               table. He picks it up and, gently runs his fingers over the \n               cover.\n\n<b>               RECEIVING ROOM - THE LONDON\n</b>\n               There is total pandemonium in the receiving room. The room \n               is filled with screaming men, women and children. Two drunken \n               women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now \n               covered with blood and cuts. The women are still hysterical, \n               one minute they're sobbing, then in an instant screaming and \n               intent upon fighting again. The crowd keeps them apart. Two \n               Bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede.\n\n               To the side we see Bytes watching everything. It is still \n               too violent a scene for the Nurses to come to the women's \n               aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting. \n               Bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for \n               a chance to get behind the Nurses and on into the hospital. \n               Now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some. The \n               Nurses come forward into the crowd. Bytes moves over closer \n               to the hallways.

Somehow, between now and \n                         then I've got to make John Merrick \n                         at least seem like an intelligent \n                         man...

As soon as the Charwoman sees Merrick, \n               she screams as does Merrick, and she wriggles free, making \n               for the stairs. The Night Porter watches her go and then \n               turns to Merrick laughing noisily. He then pulls the door \n               shut with a bang.\n\n               Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place.\n\n<b>               BEDROOM (MORNING)\n</b>\n               We see Anne alone in bed, asleep.

An intelligent, \n                         sensitive, literate man, with an \n                         intimate knowledge of the Bible.

I also propose to \n                         write a letter to The Times, appealing \n                         to their readers for assistance. \n                         Knowing the generosity of the British \n                         public, I feel we would have little \n                         trouble in raising the funds for his \n                         maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's \n                         rules do preclude the admission of \n                         incurables, but if ever there was an \n                         exception to the rule, it is this \n                         patient. So therefore, I propose, if \n                         Mr. Treves is finished, that we put \n                         it to a vote.

In the meantime, of course, \n                         he needn't be turned out. He may \n                         stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square \n                         until such time as more suitable \n                         arrangements can be made, thus freeing \n                         the Isolation Ward for more deserving \n                         patients.

She tries to hold it in, but to no avail. She reaches a \n               hand out to Merrick and he takes it. He tries to comfort \n               her.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Please... please...\n\n               But Anne goes on, as Treves, in wonder, watches her and \n               Merrick locked together in the communication of intense \n               sympathy.\n\n<b>               REAR ENTRANCE - THE LONDON\n</b>\n               Merrick, in the dimly lit rear hall, is huddled over a trash \n               can tucked underneath a stairway. He pulls out a discarded \n               drug box. He holds it closely to his chest and goes into his \n               room.\n\n<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM\n</b>\n               Merrick goes to his table and puts the box down. He hangs up \n               his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the \n               curtains aside. Moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the \n               portrait of his Mother. John seats himself and sets the box \n               in front of him. He reaches for a pencil, and then begins to \n               draw windows on the front of the box.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE MERRICK'S ROOM (MORNING)\n</b>\n               Nora is coming down the hall with a breakfast tray.

The sides of the box are covered with carefully drawn \n               windows and archways.\n\n               There is a knock at the door and Merrick, startled, looks \n               up. Nora enters and puts the tray on the table. She glances \n               at the box.\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                         Good morning, Mr. Merrick.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Good morning.\n\n               She turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath \n               supplies.

Nora, curious now, walks \n               to the table.\n\n               Merrick, conscious of her presence, leans back in his chair \n               and looks up at her.\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                         What is this that you're doing?\n\n               Merrick is silent.\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                              (pointing at the box)\n                         What is it?\n\n               Merrick points through the window.\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                         What?

The movement makes \n               Nora aware of his body, and he is the Elephant Man once again.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         I'll have to find some more.\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                              (uncomfortably)\n                         Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.\n\n               She quickly exits. Merrick watches her go and then turns \n               back to his work.\n\n               He sees the towel and the blanket. He turns quickly to call \n               after Nora, but stops himself. Merrick takes up the towel \n               and blanket, walks into the bathroom, and carefully drapes \n               the towel over the back of the bath.\n\n<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM\n</b>\n               Merrick is at his table working on his cathedral.

Treves ponders over what Merrick has just \n               said. He looks at Merrick and something very odd happens. \n               Merrick is looking levelly at him.\n\n               For the first and only time, we see expression on his face. \n               It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that \n               very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's \n               head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to \n               comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the \n               moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the \n               bookcase to replace the volume.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         John...?\n\n               There's a knock at the door.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Come in.\n\n               Nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. \n               Merrick says nothing.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Are you looking for me, Sister?\n\n<b>                                     NORA\n</b>                         No sir, Mr. Merrick.\n                              (to Merrick)\n                         I have something for you.\n\n               She puts the parcel on the table and opens it.

Merrick lays the \n               things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires \n               from the discarded box. Nora smiles at the busy Merrick and \n               exits.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         The cathedral is coming along nicely.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                              (bending over the \n                              model)\n                         Yes, soon I will start the main spire, \n                         but I must finish these columns first, \n                         How kind of her!\n\n               Treves notices to his dismay that the growths on Merrick's \n               head are larger.\n\n               He finds it very difficult to disguise his concern.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         How blind of me.

He goes over to his cloak, reaches into \n               it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. He hands it to \n               Treves, who examines it closely.

Carr Gomm goes into his office.\n\n<b>               CARR'S OFFICE\n</b>\n               Mothershead is standing by the desk looking through a small \n               stack of mail.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD\n</b>                         Is this all there is for John?\n\n<b>                                     CARR\n</b>                         I'm afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead. \n                         Perhaps tomorrow.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               HALLWAY\n</b>\n               We see in a pair of hands holding a buff colored envelope \n               embossed with the Royal Seal. We follow the hands down the \n               hall to a door where one of the hands knocks next to the \n               \"F.C.

Carr Gomm takes the letter and the porter \n               exits. Carr Gomm opens the letter and reads, his expression \n               changing from concern to delight.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD\n</b>                         What is it? What is it?\n\n               Carr Gomm hands her the letter. Never having touched Royal \n               stationary before, Mothershead handles it delicately. She \n               begins to read.\n\n<b>               COMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON\n</b>\n               Broadneck and the other committee members are seated at their \n               table, anxious to get the meeting underway. They talk among \n               themselves.\n\n               The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves enter. Treves seems \n               quite nervous, but Carr Gomm is relaxed and smiling.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Don't you think this is a bit \n                         premature?

Had we not ascertained that \n                         an Elephant Man is not acceptable as \n                         a patient? Have we not, very \n                         generously, allowed the creature to \n                         use two of our rooms until such time \n                         as he could be properly disposed of? \n                         Have we not...\n\n<b>               CUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM\n</b>\n               Merrick is working on his cathedral, painting details with a \n               very fine brush.\n\n               As he lifts the brush from the paint jar, a drop falls on \n               the table. Merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes \n               up the spilled paint with a cloth.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         I must be more careful!\n\n<b>               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM\n</b>\n<b>                                     BROADNECK\n</b>                         Which brings to mind my next point. \n                         The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In \n                         a society such as ours, it is of \n                         paramount importance that we not \n                         stray from the established order. \n                         Has that order not already been \n                         fearfully strained by allowing this... \n                         this... sideshow exhibit to take up \n                         residence, however temporary, in two \n                         very useful rooms, the purpose of \n                         which would be far better served in \n                         accommodating treatable patients, \n                         patients to whom this hospital was \n                         originally dedicated? I believe we \n                         have a duty...\n\n               Carr Gomm still smiles. Treves is about to spring to Merrick's \n               defense, but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for him \n               to remain silent. Treves is perplexed. Carr Gomm checks his \n               pocket watch.\n\n<b>               CUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM\n</b>\n               Merrick as before, busily working away. We see a ladybug \n               crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral. Merrick \n               notices it and watches for a moment, then reaches up and \n               lays a finger alongside the bug. The bug crawls onto his \n               finger and Merrick holds it closer to him.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         ...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home... \n                         it's cloudy out, I know, but remember; \n                         behind the clouds there is always \n                         the sun.\n\n<b>               CUT TO WHITECHAPEL ROAD\n</b>\n               We see a Royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the \n               hospital. A footman jumps down and opens the door. A very \n               elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge.\n\n<b>               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM\n</b>\n               Broadneck is still talking.\n\n<b>                                     BROADNECK\n</b>                         ...In light of these facts, our course \n                         is clear.

I \n                         move that this Elephant Man be removed \n                         from the premises immediately.

Treves is very \n               nervous.\n\n<b>               CUT TO HALLWAY\n</b>\n               We see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. \n               They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very \n               startled, and curtsey deeply.\n\n               Mothershead comes into the hall, also curtseying madly. She \n               is followed by the elegantly dressed woman, who is followed \n               in turn by two footmen. They walk regally down the hall.\n\n<b>               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM\n</b>\n<b>                                     BROADNECK\n</b>                         ...No, my mind is made up on this, \n                         and I am resolved to stand firm.

It's beginning to dawn \n               on him that this is indeed his, that at last he has a real \n               home, a place of his own.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                              (trying the words on \n                              for size)\n                         My home.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         There is one more thing, John.

Merrick is overjoyed with the gift. He lovingly handles \n               the articles, taking them in and out of their compartments \n               opening and closing the bag.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Is it the one you wanted?\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Oh, Mr. Treves.

He takes each article out of the \n               bag and lays it carefully on the table, all in very neat \n               order. He stares at the elegant objects, then rearranges \n               them.\n\n               Merrick picks up the toothbrush, examining it with a sort of \n               reverence. He does the same with the ivory-handled razors \n               and the comb.\n\n<b>               THE PEACOCK - WHITECHAPEL\n</b>\n               There's a good crowd in tonight; lots of drinking and shouting \n               and glasses breaking. Several of the neighborhood \"working \n               girls\" are having a bit of a rest, looking for a laugh. The \n               Night Porter is rounding up customers, his pockets ringing \n               with coins. People have their hands raised urging the Night \n               Porter to take them along to see The Elephant Man. The Night \n               Porter goes to a table where a MAN sits with two of the girls.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         Here now, these lovely ladies ain't \n                         never seen it!\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                              (to Man)\n                         You're on mate.\n                              (to all the others)\n                         Alright, alright, that's enough for \n                         this performance.\n\n               The others all moan their disappointment.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         Hang on, hang on, there's always \n                         tomorrow night.

The Ladies are rather unsteady on their \n               feet. As they all leave, the Night Porter says:\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         Quietly now! Quietly! We don't want \n                         to scare him.\n                              (he laughs)\n\n<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM\n</b>\n               (Merrick as before) he reaches over to the picture of Mrs. \n               Kendal and picks it up. We see his face reflected in the \n               glass. Merrick sets the picture down on the table. He takes \n               up one of the silver brushes and, using the picture as a \n               mirror, neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull. He \n               lays the brush down in its specific spot.\n\n               Merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand. He opens \n               the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand. He \n               takes up his walking stick, breathes deeply, then walks around \n               the room in a slow circle. Merrick is transforming himself. \n               Merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection \n               in the picture. With the ring, the stick, the cigarette and \n               his neatly brushed hair, Merrick is the very image of a \n               dashing young man about town. He inclines his head to the \n               picture.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Hello, my name is John Merrick.

Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the \n               Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The \n               Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically. Merrick frantically \n               begins to put away his dressing bag articles. When Merrick \n               starts taking off his ring, the Night Porter comes over to \n               him and grabs him by the cloak.\n\n<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER\n</b>                         No, no!

The Elephant Man!\n\n               He strips off Merrick's cloak. The audience gasps. A few \n               people who have been before laugh and clap.\n\n<b>                                     MAN (W/THE WHORES)\n</b>                              (laughing and clapping)\n                         Horrible...

The Whores laugh drunkenly and \n               halfheartedly resist being taken in to see The Elephant Man. \n               As they are pushed through the door,\n\n<b>                                     WHORES\n</b>                         Come on Jack...

The Night Porter laughs \n               at their discomfort. The Man notices all of Merrick's pictures \n               of women.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         'Cor, he's a real ladies' man, come \n                         on... give the ladies' man a kiss.\n\n               He lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from \n               behind at the wrists.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         Come on, you'll give him a kiss.\n\n<b>                                     WHORE\n</b>                              (still laughing but a \n                              trifle scared)\n                         Come on, Jack.\n\n               The Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for \n               the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man \n               forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to \n               force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, \n               being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night \n               Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick \n               and the whore now have their faces pressed together.

Others \n               follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral \n               falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces.\n\n               Because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside \n               lets Merrick fall to the ground.\n\n               The Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. \n               He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to \n               Merrick, lifting him to his feet.\n\n               Unseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick \n               is now standing.\n\n               The crowd moves in.

He's \n               pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally \n               Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on \n               Merrick's head.

They are quite different \n               from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. \n               These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them.\n\n               The audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the \n               freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. \n               They seem hard, and cold and jaded.\n\n               We move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. \n               Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs \n               a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing \n               behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels.\n\n               A lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A \n               Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There \n               is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, \n               affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out \n               of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and \n               the occasional thunder.\n\n               Finally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible \n               fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many \n               years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are \n               looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting \n               impatiently to see the Elephant Man.\n\n<b>                                     BYTES\n</b>                         ...The result is plain to see.

Merrick is standing unsteadily in the \n               wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A \n               few shrieks are heard.

Some of the crowd laughs at this, others \n               shudder at the strange sight.\n\n               Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing \n               irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the \n               stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him \n               savagely in the back.\n\n<b>                                     BYTES\n</b>                         Dance!\n\n               Merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first \n               row flinch back.\n\n               Merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the \n               stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               THE BACK OF THE WAGON - DAY\n</b>\n               The poster is rolled up, Merrick on the floor of the wagon \n               wheezing horribly.\n\n               Beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop \n               and potatoes.\n\n               Bytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at \n               Merrick.

The boy is passing amongst \n               the people with a cap, collecting coins. Merrick lifts his \n               face to the sky, the sound of his own misery mingling with \n               his elephant call.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               SMALL CIRCUS - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We see the poster of the Elephant Man.

Without his stick \n               this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It \n               is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the \n               halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him.\n\n               Bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves \n               to place a stool next to Merrick.\n\n<b>                                     BYTES\n</b>                              (rapping)\n                         Up!

Again the audience shouts its disapproval, \n               booing and hissing the Elephant Man.

He cannot do it!\n\n               Bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, \n               goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters \n               precariously on the stool.

Merrick \n               senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He \n               lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that \n               sound very little like an elephant.\n\n<b>                                     BYTES\n</b>                         Louder!\n\n               Merrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd \n               begins to jeer at\n\n               Merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. \n               Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to \n               step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for \n               him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The \n               crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous \n               mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects \n               at the wagon.\n\n               Bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry.

Something is happening inside Merrick. \n               A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him \n               very deep down and far away.\n\n               This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to \n               pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving \n               mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body.\n\n               The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body \n               shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. \n               The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. \n               Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with \n               a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. \n               He whirls about and cries out again a shattering \"No\", the \n               force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him \n               onto the cage floor, dumbfounded.\n\n               Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it \n               into the group of monkeys on the floor.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b><b>                         NO!

Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the \n               monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys \n               make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick \n               silently watching him with fear.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               THE SILENT FACES OF THE MONKEYS\n</b>\n               We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his \n               sleeping position.\n\n               We see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still \n               night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The \n               whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. \n               Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks \n               around. The whispering stops.\n\n               We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus \n               gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: \n               2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with \n               the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, \n               a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. \n               The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's \n               head.\n\n<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF\n</b>                         You alright?\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         y-y-yes--\n\n<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF\n</b>                         Want to come out?\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         You're English.\n\n<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF\n</b>                         Of course!

The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, \n               after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks \n               gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind \n               him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced \n               man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The \n               lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. \n               Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.\n\n<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF\n</b>                         We've decided...

He sees the small caravan \n               of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns \n               bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for \n               Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of \n               it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick \n               and disguise.\n\n               He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely \n               shaped beings.

The boy watches \n               the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and \n               looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the \n               dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few \n               blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the \n               garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into \n               the darkness.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               WOODS - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We see the beams of the lanterns moving through the trees \n               like will-o-the-wisps.\n\n               They help Merrick along, the plumed Dwarf directing them \n               from time to time.

Then he and Merrick \n               walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.\n\n<b>               ON THE PLATFORM\n</b>\n               The train is about to leave.

As they pass the windows of the first-class \n               carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome \n               people on their plush seats.\n\n               The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the \n               door.\n\n<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF\n</b>                         This'll do.\n\n               He looks down the platform.

The Plumed Dwarf grabs his hand and \n               they shake.\n\n               He shuts the door. As the carriage passes, Merrick's mask is \n               pressed up against the window. The Plumed Dwarf waves to him \n               as the train moves away.\n\n               He looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the \n               platform.\n\n<b>               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - INTERIOR\n</b>\n               Merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage.

We see the whole carriage now; the \n               cowering people and Merrick at the far end. Seeing their \n               silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, \n               facing the back wall. Merrick looks around for a moment, \n               then sees his reflection in the window. He stares at himself.\n\n<b>               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE\n</b>\n               The carriage is dark now, and empty except for Merrick.

The Conductor, \n               expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, \n               who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp.\n\n               Merrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends \n               from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He \n               looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. \n               TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing \n               and mimicking his uneven gait.\n\n<b>               OOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT)\n</b>\n               We see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel \n               steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling \n               at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome \n               face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and \n               smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the \n               end of the line is smiling back.\n\n               We see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards \n               the station.\n\n               The rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly \n               moves into the light.\n\n               The Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers \n               her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from \n               the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, \n               ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops.\n\n               The First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He \n               walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his \n               breath as the First-Mate walks up.

They stare at \n               each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other \n               Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing \n               again.\n\n               Merrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping \n               his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the \n               drunken music.\n\n<b>               OOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING)\n</b>\n               We see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the \n               wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the \n               morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket \n               Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On \n               board, everyone prepares to get underway.\n\n               Merrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, \n               half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, \n               about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and \n               stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets \n               a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He \n               reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman \n               at the plank.\n\n<b>                                     TICKET TAKER\n</b>                         Wait! One more!\n\n               He turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival.\n\n<b>                                     TICKET TAKER\n</b>                         You'll have to hurr...\n\n               His mouth drops. Merrick hurries past him. The crewman now \n               also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of \n               the gangplank. The shrill ship's whistle blows.\n\n<b>               ON BOARD\n</b>\n               Merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, \n               his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped \n               around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit \n               his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He \n               wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice.\n\n<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Look! It's Dover!\n\n               Through the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the \n               railing, arm in arm. The Young Woman points. The Young Man \n               turns to her and smiles.\n\n<b>                                     YOUNG MAN\n</b>                         Finally! Dover!\n\n               They laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. \n               Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and \n               pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks \n               onto the deck looking after the young couple.\n\n               Merrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of \n               the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover.\n\n<b>               DOCKSIDE - DOVER\n</b>\n               The ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. \n               Passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed \n               by the crowd. On the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see \n               Merrick. He looks around, then moves off into the crowd. The \n               crowd moves past a sign saying, \"To The Trains\".\n\n<b>               LONDON TRAIN - INTERIOR\n</b>\n               Through a rain-streaked window we see rolling green \n               countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy \n               black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. \n               Beside him his wife knits.\n\n               A few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN \n               across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching \n               the Elderly Man eat.\n\n<b>               LONDON TRAIN - EXTERIOR\n</b>\n               The last car speeds down the track and disappears.\n\n<b>               LIVERPOOL STREET STATION\n</b>\n               Grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy \n               ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below \n               fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the \n               station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and \n               passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking \n               for their train.\n\n               A YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult \n               and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only \n               a portion of her billowy skirt.\n\n               We hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. \n               The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He \n               sees something.\n\n               The Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving \n               past the barrier.\n\n               The Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts \n               a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His \n               Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHER'S VOICE\n</b>                         Little beast!

Merrick \n               is moving past the barrier. He stops to look around and plan \n               his next move. The Boy sees him. He tugs on his Mother's \n               skirt.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         Mummy! Mummy! Look at that man!

He sees the Boy tugging at his Mother's skirt and \n               pointing at him.\n\n               He turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall \n               stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to \n               blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him.\n\n               Merrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a \n               second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him.\n\n<b>                                     LITTLE JIM\n</b>                         Hey Mister, why is your head so big?\n\n               Merrick turns and looks at Little Jim. He looks quickly \n               around. We see, across the station, an open archway leading \n               out into a street. Merrick moves away from Little Jim out of \n               frame. Little Jim watches him go.\n\n<b>                                     LITTLE JIM\n</b>                         Mister!\n\n               Two other BOYS join Little Jim. The three of them watch the \n               escaping Merrick, then move off after him. Merrick is \n               frantically trying to make it to the archway. The three boys \n               appear behind him and call out.\n\n<b>                                     BOYS\n</b>                         Mister!

He lifts it, trying to catch a glimpse of the \n               mysterious stranger. Merrick pulls away and tries to go \n               faster. Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting \n               him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, \n               determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off.\n\n               Merrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the \n               boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly.\n\n<b>                                     LITTLE JIM\n</b>                         Now I'll see you...\n\n               He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a \n               spasm of fear.\n\n               He lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, \n               looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her \n               son's cries, looks up immediately.\n\n               She sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the \n               station.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHER\n</b>                         My son! My son! Help!\n\n               Merrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls \n               away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing \n               the noise, watch him go. He knocks down a little girl in his \n               flight and she, too, starts screaming.\n\n               Through the archway comes a bobby. Jim's Mother, now with \n               her son, calls to him.\n\n<b>                                     MOTHER\n</b>                         Stop that man! Stop that man!\n\n               Merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the \n               arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks \n               quickly towards him.\n\n               Merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's \n               mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. \n               They yell at him angrily.\n\n               One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's \n               hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the \n               hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, \n               following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children \n               and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from \n               his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking \n               all escape.\n\n               Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it \n               followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside.\n\n               Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. \n               They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in \n               their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping \n               for an opening. There is none.\n\n               He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes \n               his way through the crowd.\n\n               Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block \n               out the screams of the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                              (quietly to himself)\n                         I am not an animal...

Goodnight.\n\n               He turns and starts out the door.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Mr. Treves?\n\n               Treves comes back to Merrick.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Yes John?\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. \n                         Is it alright, did I make any mistakes \n                         that you can see?\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                              (looking at the \n                              cathedral)\n                         No, John, not one that I can see.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Then I shouldn't change anything?\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.\n\n               The two look at each other silently.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         ...I'll walk you to the door.\n\n               Merrick rises and goes with Treves to the door.\n\n<b>                                     TREVES\n</b>                         Goodnight John. Sleep well.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         You too, my friend. Goodnight.\n\n               Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened hallway. \n               Merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. \n               We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps. Merrick goes \n               back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different \n               angles. He picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, \n               and makes a few final brush strokes.\n\n               He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it \n               for a long time. He lowers the brush to his side.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         It is finished.\n\n               The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if \n               it were St. Philips itself shrunk to a miniature. He goes to \n               the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs \n               his name at the base of the main spire.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         John... Merrick!\n\n               He sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes \n               the model towards the window. The movement causes him pain. \n               He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. \n               Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. He looks at \n               the cathedral again, then around at his room. We see in the \n               dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his \n               dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's \n               picture on the table. A slight breeze billows the curtains. \n               We move in very close to them.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n               High altitude... roiling clouds with lightning flashes and \n               low thunder. The sky is in turmoil.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK (V.O.)\n</b>                         When will the stream be aweary of \n                         flowing under my eye?\n\n               Lightning flash... thunder roll. The clouds are mingling and \n               scattering.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK (V.O.)\n</b>                         When will the wind be aweary of \n                         blowing over the sky?\n\n               The clouds erupt, pushed onward and onward... they slowly \n               begin to calm as... they turn slowly into... elephants linked \n               trunk to tail moving slowly away from us...\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK (V.O.)\n</b>                         When will the clouds be aweary of \n                         fleeting?\n\n               The elephants are calmer than the skies we saw... they keep \n               moving onward and onward...\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK (V.O.)\n</b>                         When will the heart be aweary of \n                         beating....\n\n               A lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky. The elephants \n               seem to be moving on it... into the distance.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK (V.O.)\n</b>                         ...and nature die?\n\n               Knock, knock sound. The curtain moves to one side wiping the \n               elephants away with it. There is no terrified audience behind \n               the curtain. There is only light and Merrick's Mother smiling \n               a calm and benign smile.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN'S MUM\n</b>                         Never, oh! Never, nothing will die; \n                         the stream flows, the wind blows, \n                         the cloud fleets, the heart beats...\n\n               The light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot see \n               John's Mother anymore. It almost blinds us.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN'S MUM\n</b>                         Nothing will die.\n\n<b>                                                                 WHITE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Elephant-Man,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Elephant Man, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Christopher De Vore\" title=\"Scripts by Christopher De Vore\">Christopher De Vore</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Eric Bergren\" title=\"Scripts by Eric Bergren\">Eric Bergren</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Lynch\" title=\"Scripts by David Lynch\">David Lynch</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Elephant Man, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Elephant Man, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:04:21.276210"}
