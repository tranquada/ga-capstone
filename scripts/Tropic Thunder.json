Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what\n          the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen\n          enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.\n\n          ON THE GUERRILLAS\n          Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of\n          the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their\n          screams, they drop back...\n\n          GUERILLA LEADER\n          \n          The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up\n          RPGs...\n\n          EXT.

Lets do-it-\n          to-it!\n          Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly,\n          brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A\n\n          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING\n\n          It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,\n          surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing\n          in the jungle, by a small river.\n          There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which\n          leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure\n          is a low, concrete military-looking building.\n          It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed\n          badasses.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n          Tropic Thunder 50.\n          CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are\n          marched through the courtyard, and into a building.\n\n          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER\n\n          We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In\n          front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar\n          heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.\n          A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.\n          The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He's\n          badly shaken.\n\n          BYONG\n          \n          The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.\n\n          UNSEEN LEADER\n          .\n\n          BYONG\n          \n\n          UNSEEN LEADER.\n          .\n\n          EXT.

That's the whole point.\n          Damien wants us tired and confused.\n\n          REDYKULOUS\n          Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for\n          those objectives.\n          Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus\n          notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.\n\n          SPEEDMAN\n          Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break,\n          but be on the lookout for anything.\n          Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break\n          or not.\n          Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.\n          Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take\n          a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.\n          Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears\n          something rustle next to him.\n\n          LAZARUS (O.S.)\n          Psst. Hey.\n          Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close\n          to him.\n\n          LAZARUS\n          Speedman is watching. I don't have much\n          time. I don't really need to piss. I\n          need to talk to you. You went to the\n          boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read\n          that map?\n\n          SANDUSKY\n          Yeah...\n\n          LAZARUS\n          Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That\n          hoor's melt really thinks this is a\n          movie.

It's only a matter of\n          time before he walks us into more mines\n          or more of whoever the hell was shootin',\n          at us. That muppet's going to get us all\n          killed. I need to convince everyone.to\n          turn around, but I .can't do it without\n          the map. You're the only one who can\n          read it. Can I count on you?\n\n          SANDUSKY\n          Well, yeah, I.guess. But\n\n          LAZARUS\n          Good man, Good man.\n          Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing,\n          shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.\n          Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?\n          Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee\n          again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see\n          Speedman, right next to him.\n\n          SPEEDMAN\n          I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't\n          need to pee. I need to talk to you.\n          Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat\n          and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create\n          a red pee.stream.\n\n          SPEEDMAN\n          Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and.\n          he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all\n          of us. The men respect you, because you\n          went to boot camp and rehearsal.\n          (patting his shoulder)\n          And you're pretty handy with that map. I\n          need you on my side, Kyle.\n\n          SANDUSKY\n          Kevin.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n          Tropic Thunder 53.\n\n          SPEEDMAN-\n          If you stick with the program, I'm gonna\n          talk to some of the Dreamworks\n          brass... there'll probably be a Teen\n          Choice award in it for you. You have\n          that potential.\n\n          SANDUSKY\n          Well, I --\n\n          SPEEDMAN\n          Good man. Good man.\n          Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.\n\n          EXT.
