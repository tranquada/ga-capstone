BANGKOK. NIGHT.\nA single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out\nExtreme noise and light.\nBeyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle (\"tuk-tud\") and its Thai driver\nA young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating.\nThey travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists.\nMusic and credits.\n\n\n\nEXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT\nThe bright headlight comes to a halt. \nRichard climbs down from the tuk-tuk\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nWhen you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go.\nThe street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers.\nRichard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back.\nHe absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\n(continuing)\nThe Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home.\nRichard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch.\nHUSTLER\nYou need somewhere to stay?\nRICHARD \nI'll be OK, Thanks.\nRichard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers.\nHUSTLER\nWhat do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to drink some snake blood?\nAt this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler.\nRICHARD\nNo thanks.\nRichard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him.\nHUSTLER\nYou want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\t\nYeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here. And what do they want, all these people?\n\n\nEXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT./ INT. BARS AND SHOPS. NIGHT.\nVarious young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other.\nTRAVELER 1\nWhere you been?\nTRAVELER 2\nWhere you going?\nTRAVELER 3\nI've been there\nTRAVELER 4\nIt's a waste of time\nTRAVELER1\nWe just got back\nTRAVELER2\nFantastic\nTRAVELER 3\nHow much did it cost?\nTRAVELER5\nA complete rip off.\nTRAVELER3\nToo many people. There's a much better place along the coast.\nTRAVELER 4\nWe're going exploring. We've read this book. It tells us all the best places to explore.\nTRAVELER 2\nI know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled.\nTRAVELER 1\nI heard they built a big hotel there.\nTRAVELER 5\nSome sort of sewage problem, apparently.\nTRAVELER 1\nWe're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nBut for me it's all about finding out something about a place, and something about yourself. And when you get off the beaten track, that's where you find out what there is to find out.\nRichard turns into one of the restaurants.\n\n\nINT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.\nThe restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment.\nAt the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.\nA Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a \"menu\" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.\nRichard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht.\nThe Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.\nA worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.\nRICHARD\nGood evening.\nDaffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink.\nRichard will not be stared down. Neither turns away.\nThe Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly.\nHOTEL RECEPTIONIST\nWelcome to Thailand.\nRichard turns to her.\nRICHARD\nThank you.\n\n\n INT SHOWER. NIGHT\nIn a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT\nThe sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign.\nThe sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.\nHe walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor.\nWhile he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.\nThere is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.\nRichard turns to the source of the whistle.\nA beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.\nFRANCOIS\nEt voila.\nThe door swings gently open. She stands back\nRICHARD\nThank you.\nFootsteps approach from the stair.\nFrancoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard to the next door.\nFRANCOISE\nBonsoir.\nRICHARD\nEh - bonsoir.\nETIENNE\nGoodnight.\nThe couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door is closed behind them.\nAlone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.\n\n\nINT RESTAURANT. NIGHT\nRichard is in the restaurant which is quiet now.\nHe is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television.\nMost of the tables around him are empty.\nRichard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.\nDAFFY\nExcuse me.\nRICHARD\nYes?\nDAFFY\nI'm Daffy.\nRICHARD\nRichard. Hi.\nDAFFY\nLook, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.\nRICHARD\nHelp you out?\nDAFFY\nYeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.\nRICHARD\nI'm sorry, I don't think so.\nDAFFY\nI'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.\nRICHARD\nI'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.\nDAFFY\nJust five dollars, please.\nHe leans in close to Richard\nDAFFY\n(continuing)\nI'll share something with you.\nRICHARD\nI'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.\nDaffy retreats.\nRichard turns back to the video and his food.\nDaffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.\nDAFFY\nExcuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. I'm down on my luck at the moment.\nThe two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.\nDAFFY\n(continuing)\nif you could see your way to lending me some cash -\nRICHARD\nHere.\nHe leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy.\nDAFFY\nThank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.\nRICHARD\nJust take it, OK.\nDaffy takes it.\nRichard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face. \n\n\nINT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.\nSome light enters from the street through a small window.\nRichard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him.\nHe is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.\nRichard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time.\nDAFFY (O.S.)\nHave. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke.\nHave. You. Got. Anything. To. -\n\n\nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.\nRichard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room.\nThe door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then before.\nRICHARD\nNo, I don't have anything to smoke.\nDaffy stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns.\nDAFFY\nYou. You're the guy that lent me the money.\nRICHARD\nYeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.\nDAFFY\nTen dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?\nRICHARD\nLook I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -\nDAFFY\nYea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.\nRICHARD\nThanks.\nRichard turns away.\nDAFFY\nRichard -\nHe turns back.\nDAFFY\n(Continuing)\nBeen nice knowing you.\nHe sticks his hand out.\nRichard politely reciprocates.\nRICHARD\nSure.\nThey shake hands. \n\n\nINT. EXT. RESTAURANT. DAY.\nThe restaurant fronts on to the street where a new day's activity is beginning.\nRichard watches this as he eats his breakfast.\nHe notices Etienne and Francoise sti down at the next table.\nRICHARD\nBonjour.\nETIENNE\nGood morning.\nFRANCOISE\nDid you sleep well?\nRICHARD\nNot too bad.\nFRANCOISE\nI hope our noise did not keep you awake.\nRichard looks from one to the other.\nRICHARD\nThe noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.\nETIENNE\nShe means your neighbor. The Scotsman\nRICHARD\nOh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.\nETIENNE\nWe moved rooms because of him.\nFRANCOISE\nHe tried to borrow money from us.\nETIENNE\nWhat idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.\nFRANCOISE\nHe said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.\nETIENNE\nIt's on an island that no one get to.\nFRANCOISE\nBut he has been there, off course.\nETIENNE\nIt was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.\nRICHARD\nIt would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.\nETIENNE\nOf course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there. \n\n\nINT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY\nOn a large board are details, photographs and prices of various standard excursions. A Thai TRAVEL AGENT reels them off at great speed.\nTRAVEL AGENT\nNakhon - Pathom - Phra Ptahom Chedi - Damnoen Sadual floating market - eight hundred baht. Kanchanburi - Erwan national Park Phrathat Cave, huang Khamin Falls - six hundred baht. Nam Tok, hellfire Pass, Three Pagodas, Sai Yok National Park - fifteen hundred baht. Bang Pa In Royal Palace, Ayatthaya, Wat Phra Manhathat, Wat Raburna - one thousand baht. What do you want?\nRichard studies the board but is not excited.\nRICHARD\nTwenty Marlboro light, please.\nInstantly the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes from a shelf and lays them on the counter.\n\n\n\nEXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. DAY.\nRichard lights up and looks around.\nHe looks through the tapes at a stall. \n\n\nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY\nRichard walks along the corridor towards his room, his new tape playing on his walkman.\nOn his door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin.\nRichard lifts it off and unfolds it.\nIt is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a cluster of islands. Some are named. One is unnamed. On it, some features are marked; hills, forest, river and a letter X.\nIn the corner it reads \"X = beach\".\nRichard switches his Walkman off.\nHe studies the map then walks to Daffy's door and knocks.\nNo reply.\nRichard twists the handle and pushes gently. The door opens.\n\n\nINT DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY.\nThe room is dim, be even so the blood can be seen sprayed and smeared around the walls, sheets and floor.\nThere is no sign of Daffy.\nRichard treads carefully, avoiding the pools of blood on the floor.\nHe reaches the other side of the room. There, wedged in the narrow gap between bed and wall, is Daffy's corpse. His wrists have been cut.\nRichard studies the map again.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nYou hope and you dream, but you never believe that something's going to happen for you, not like it does in the movies. And when it does, you sort of expect it to feel different. More visceral. More real. Like IMAX maybe. I was waiting for it to hit me, but it didn't. And just for the record, I never did get my ten dollars back.\nRichard switches his walkman back on.\n\n\nINT. POLICE STATION. DAY.\nIn an office, two policemen, one in UNIFORM and the other a DETECTIVE, stand over Richard while he signs a statement.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThe police didn't want to waste any time on it. They were just pissed off becase he was traveling on a false passport, name of Mr Daffy\nDuck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of fucked up all the paperwork. They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but all they wanted form me was a statement saying I found him and it looked like he cut his wrists. No problem.\nThe detective studies Richard's passport.\nDETECTIVE\nWhat are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?\nRICHARD\nTraveler.\nDETECTIVE\nYou go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.\nRICHARD\nI don't think so.\nDETECTIVE\nWhy not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.\nRICHARD\nI wouldn't know anything about that, sir.\n\n\nINT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR. DAY\nThe door of the office opens and Richard walks out.\nLined up in the corridor, slouching against the walls, are several other travelers from the hotel. At the front of the queue are Francoise and Etienne.\nThe officer beckons Etienne into the office and closes the door.\nRichard and Francoise acknowledge each other with a smile.\n\n\nINT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. DAY.\nRichard is seated at the top of his bed, addressing his speech out of shot while he holds the map.\nRICHARD\nOK, this island may not actually exist. And even if it does, we might not be able to get there. But look at it like this: what else is there to do around here?\nRichard is alone.\nRICHARD\n(continuing)\nSo what do you think? Are you going to come or not. I'd be thrilled if you'd join me, you and your\u0085you and your boyfriend.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY\nRichard knocks on his neighbors' door.\nEtienne opens it.\nRICHARD\nHi. You want to take a hike? I mean a trip. A journey. With your girlfriend and me. I mean the two of you, and me. It's a secret island. Paradise. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about.\nFrancoise appears behind Etienne.\nFRANCOISE\nHi.\nRICHARD\nHi there. Here, take a look.\nHe shows Etienne the map.\nRICHARD\n(continuing)\nIt's a map. The dead guy left it for me; I think it's the place he tried to sell you. It's going to be just fucking great. You want to come? I'd be thrileld if\u0085\nFrancoise and Etienne are looking at him.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI realized that I had absolutely no idea of how I was going to get there. \n\n\nEXT. RAILWAY/THAI COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT.\nA train travels at night alongside fields. \n\n\nINT. TRAIN. NIGHT\nRichard is awake. Opposite him, Etienne and Francoise are slumped together in sleep.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nEtienne, however, and I have to hand it to the guy, was fucking great. He organized the whole thing: tickets, timetables, best route, the whole damn trip. \n\n\nEXT. SEA. DAY.\nThe bow of a passenger ferry crashes through a wave.\n\n\nEXT. BOAT DAY.\nThe decks are crowded with travelers and their packs. Amongst them are Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Maps and guidebooks are being studied by many. The noise of the engines and the wind deters conversation.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThanks to him we hit the final stop on the tourist trail inside twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we would hire what he called a \"local fisherman\" to take us on the last stage of our journey.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT EXT. TRUCK. DAY\nInside back of a covered, converted pick-up, four people are seated down each side, amongst them Richard, Francoise, and Etienne.\nBehind them as they bump along, can be seen the dusty red road bordered with dense green shrubs.\nThe truck stops.\n\n\nEXT. ROAD. DAY.\nRichard unloads the final of the three rucksacks from the roof of the truck, passing it down to Etienne who stands at the back with Francoise.\nThe truck pulls away, revealing as sign, \"Seashell Bungalows\".\n\n\nEXT. BUNGALOW. DAY.\nA simple wooden shack on stilts, one of several standing in a line at the edge of the beach. There is a small porch to the front.\n\n\nINT. BUNGALOW. DAY\nA spartan room: bed, mosquito nets, chair, cupboard, fan.\nRichard dumps his rucksack.\n\n\nExt. SEA/BEACH. DAY.\nA long inflatable tube is towed past by a motorboat, its passengers whooping with delight.\nAs it passes, Francoise is revealed, standing in the water, looking in towards the shore. She begins to walk in.\nOn the beach there are sunbathers, games of beach volley ball, and vendors selling food and sunglasses.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThis was just the kind of place I didn't want to hang around. Not that it's lacking in comfort. Quite the opposite. It's got everything. Everything you could possibly need to make you feel at home. And what's the point of that.\nOn the beach Francoise picks up a towel.\n\nEXT. BEACH RESTAURANT. DAY.\nThe restaurant fronts on to the beach. At the back there is a bar.\nRichard sits alone at a table with a drink, watching the scene on the beach, including Francoise.\nEtienne pulls up a chair and sits down.\nFrancoise will join them as the dialogue proceeds.\nETIENNE\nIt's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred baht.\nRICHARD\nNice work.\nETIENNE\nThere is one problem.\nEtienne opens the map on the table.\nETIENNE\nHe will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.\nRICHARD\nThat's the wrong one.\nETINENNE\nI know that.\nFrancoise sits down with a drink.\nRICHARD\nSo from there to there?\nFRANCOISE\nWe swim.\nRICHARD\nSwim?\nETIENNE\nWe leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.\nFRANCOISE\nYou can swim?\nRICHARD\nYes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?\nETIENNE\nOne or two kilometers.\nRICHARD\nOh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?\nETIENNE\nWhy?\nRICHARD\nWe're going to swim \"one or two kilometers\" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?\nFRANCOISE\nHave you told someone?\nRICHARD\nNo.\nFRANCOISE\nI think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.\nETIENNE\nRichard, it's secret. That's the whole point.\nRICHARD\nYeah, OK. Foreget it. We won't tell anyone.\nRichard picks up the map\n\nEXT. BUNGALOW. DAY\nRichard sits on his veranda, under cover. Beyond him is a tropical downpour.\nHe hears two sets of footsteps rushing up the stairs of the next door bungalow. Two men, Americans, Zeph and Sammy, try to open their door but cannot.\nZEPH\nFuck, I knew we locked it. We should have left it unlocked.\nSammy addresses Richard\nSAMMY\nWe lost our key\nRICHARD\nWhere did you lose it?\nZEPH\nOn the beach. Or in the water.\nSAMMY\nThe truth is we don't know.\nRICHARD\nYou try reception?\nZEPH\nClosed. Back later. We hope.\nRICHARD\nPretty annoying\nSAMMY\nIt's a disaster, to which there is only one sensible, considered, appropriate, and timely response.\n\nEXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.\nAll three are stoned. A joint is passed around while Zeph sings badly.\nZEPH\nI smoke two joints in the morning, and I smoke two joints at night, and I smoke two joints in the afternoon, and then I feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then I smoke some more. I can't remember the rest.\nRICHARD\nPerhaps you smoked too much dope.\nZEPH\nNot possible\nSAMMY\nDo you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?\"\nRICHARD\nWoman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.\nSAMMY\nExactly. Always happened to someone else.\nRICHARD\nSo?\nSAMMY\nSo there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.\nRICHARD\nUh-huh.\nZEPH\nYea. This beach is perfect. It's on an island, right, hidden from the sea. Imagine: pure white sand and enough dope to smoke all day every day for the rest of your life. Only a few know exactly where it is and they won't tell anyone.\nSAMMY\nOf course no one's actually ever met any of these people, only met someone who has. You know what I mean. It's a Kentucky fried mouse.\nRICHARD\nI hadn't heard that one before. But it's good. It's a good story.\nA torch shines on them, jolting them into some sort of reaction and a woman's voice calls out.\nTHAI WOMAN\nHey, you! I got your key!\n\nINT. BUNGALOW. DAY\nRichard's rucksack is packed an by the door.\nRichard is sitting copying Daffy's map on to another sheet of paper. He finishes and writes a note on the copy.\nHe puts the original in his pack and lifts it.\n\nEXT. BUNGALOW. DAY.\t\nRichard hops over the fence to the veranda of Zeph and Sammy's bungalow.\nHe slips the folded copy under their door.\nHe looks around to check that he has not been seen.\n\nEXT BEACH. DAY\nRichard walks along a narrow wooden pontoon, his rucksack on his back.\nHe stops about half way along at a small narrow wooden boat with an outboard motor.\nHe looks down into it.\nEtienne and Francoise walk past him along the pontoon without stopping and disappear from view.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nOK, let's face it. There is no such thing as a local fisherman anymore. There really isn't the demand for them. If you want to catch fish you put down a hundred kilometer drag net.\nRichard walks away along the pontoon.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\n(continuing)\nAnd if you want to go somewhere - you get a taxi.\n\n EXT. SEA.. DAY.\nRichard, Francoise and Etiene sit at the back of a small powerful motor launch which skims across the surface of the sea with great noise and speed.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nThe motor launch idles gently as it drifts into the shallows of a small deserted bay.\nRichard Francoise, and Etienne jump from the boat into the shallows.\n\nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\nAs the sun sets they sit in silence, each shovelling down forkloads of noodles.\n\nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\nThe only sounds are those of crickets and the waves gently breaking on the shore.\nRichard is lying asleep on the sand.\nHe is woken by someone rummaging through the rucksack beside him. It is Francoise, removing clothes, books, souvenirs. Eventually she finds her camera, a mini-tripod and a cable-release.\nShe places them on an unfolded T-shirt on the sand.\nRICHARD\nFrancoise -\nFRANCOISE\nSshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.\nRichard wakes up and works out what she is doing.\nRICHARD\nI think so too.\nFRANCOISE\nOne night I will get the perfect photograph.\nShe presses the cable release.\nFRANCOISE\n(continuing)\nUn, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six.\nShe lets the shutter close.\nFRANCOISE\n(continuing)\nTake a look.\nRichard leans over and squints down the viewfinder.\nThe sky is framed. Francoise leans into the frame.\nRichard draws back.\nRICHARD\nYou realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.\nFRANCOISE\nIncredible\nRICHARD\nThere are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.\nFRANCOISE\nSo on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.\nRICHARD\nExactly\nFRANCOISE\nRichard, you know something - \nShe hands him the cable release while she adjusts the camera.\nFRANCOISE\n(continuing)\nThat is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.\n RICHARD\n\tSorry. I thought I was doing quite well.\n FRANCOISE\n It's just the sky, Richard.\n She presses his thumb down on the cable release, her hand around his.\nFRANCOISE\n\t(continuing)\n\tUn, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept\u0085\n\n\n\nEXT. NIGHT. SKY.\nFrancoise voice fades away over an image of the night sky.\nTime lapse: the sky rapidly changes to day.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nWhen you develop an infatuation for someone, you always find a reason to believe that this is exactly the person for you. It doesn't need to be a good reason, a bad one will do just as well. Taking photographs of the night sky, for example: in the long run that's just the kind of dumb irritating habit that would cause you to split up. But at the time - it's the charming eccentricity you've been searching for all these years. \n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nFrom a different beach they look towards their target: the island. It is 1-2 kilometers away.\nRichard, Etienne, and Francoise stand on the beach looking towards it. Each is in their swimwear and a T-shirt, and carries a plastic bag, inflated and tied, in which they carry their valuables and some rations.\nETIENNE\nOne kilometer\nFRANCOISE\nTwo.\nETIENNE\nRichard?\nRICHARD\nI don't know - I'm American.\nETIENNE\nSo?\nRICHARD\nWe think in miles, not kilometers.\nETIENNE\nSo how many miles do you think it is?\nRICHARD\nI have no idea but it looks like a long way.\nFRANCOISE.\nToo far?\nRICHARD\nIf it's too far, then we'll drwon. But if we don\u0092t' try then we'll never know.\nRichard wades into the water.,\nRICHARD\nSo, let's go.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nYou have to enjoy a moment like that. You just don't know, you see; it may never happen again.\nOnce more.\nRICHARD\nSO, let's go.\n  RICHARD  (V.O.) \n I am such a fucking hero.  \"Let's go\".  I felt like I'd waited all my life just to say something like that.  So I replayed it a couple of times, taking it from different perspectives.  \n\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n  Multiple repeats of Richard's moment from various perspectives and speeds. \n  RICHARD \n So: let's go. \n  RICHARD  (V.O.) \n You have to enjoy a moment like that.  You just don't know, you see:  it may never happen again. \n  Once more.  \n  RICHARD  \n So: let's go. \nHe dives in and begins swimming.\n\nEXT. SEA. DAY.\nThey are far out to sea now, several hundred meters from the shore.\nRichard swims at the front, the other two about five meters behind.\nRICHARD\nEveryone ok?\nETIENNE\nWe're ok.\nRICHARD\nI think we're about half way.\nA few strokes later.\nETIENNE\nRichard - I saw a fin!\nRICHARD\nWhat!\nETIENNE\nA fin!\nThey all stop and tread water.\nRICHARD\nA shark fin?\nETIENNE\nI don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.\nRICHARD\nBig?\nETIENNE.\nYes.\nRICHARD\nWell what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.\nETIENNE\nNothing. I just thought you ought to know.\nRICHARD\nWell to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.\nETIENNE\nI'm sorry.\nRICHARD\nA bit fucking late.\nHe starts swimming again.\nA few strokes later he hears a short sharp scream from Francoise.\nETIENNE\nFrancoise! Francoise!\nRichard turns around. Francoise is gone. Her plastic bag bobs on the surface. Etienne is frantic, hysterical.\nETIENNE\n(continuing)\nShe is gone!\nRICHARD\nWhat happened?\nEtienne submerges briefly and resurfaces.\nETIENNE\nShe just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.\nRICHARD\nWas there a shark? Did you see a shark?\nThey both start looking down at their feet and circling frantically in the water.\nETIENNE\nI don't know! I don't know! Oh God.\nSuddenly Richard screams.\nFrancoise surfaces, pulling up his ankle.\nShe and Etienne laugh at Richard.\nRICHARD\nVery funny. You Europeans, you have ssuch a playful sense of humor. No wonder your comedy has conquered the world.\nHe swims on.\nETIENNE\nWhat about Moliere?\nRICHARD\nFuck off.\nHe swims on without looking round.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nOne by one the three swimmers emerge from the sea and collapse on the beach. They are absolutely exhausted and lie there on the sand, unable to speak.\nEventually, they tear open their plastic bags, drink some water and eat some chocolate.\nRichard has a little water left in his bottle. He notices Francoise and Etienne eyeing it enviously.\nHe holds the bottle out towards them, then snatches it back and swigs down the last of the water.\nEXT. FOREST. DAY.\nRichard, Francoise, and Etienne walk through the forest behind the beach.\n\nEXT. FOREST. DAY\nThey scramble up a steep slope through dense foliage. \nRichard, at the front, pauses to let the other two pass him, then he follows.\n\nEXT. TOP OF SLOPE/CLEARING. DAY.\nRichard reaches the top of the slope and follows the other two through a gap in the foliage.\nHe joins Etienne and Francoise who are standing in awe at the edge of a large clearing filled with cannabis plants.\nETIENNE\nNice Island.\nThey smile and examine the plants.\nRichard wanders a short distance away.\nSomething glinting on the ground catches Richard's eye. He leans down and picks it up. It is an empty brass cartridge from a rifle. Richard looks around.\nJust ahead he sees the remains of an extinguished campfire, and beyond that, protruding from the undergrowth, a pair of male legs and beyond them, the butt of a rifle.\nCLOSE IN on the nest in the undergrowth. The legs and gun belong to a Farmer. He is asleep. His physique is strong and his skin weathered.\nRichard turns back to Etienne and Francoise. They are still strolling amongst the plants.\nRichard begins to back away.\nThe Farmer wakes.\nHe lifts his gun and stands up to look out over the dope field.\n\nEXT. FIELD. DAY.\nThere is no one there.\n\nEXT. FIELD. DAY.\nThe farmer looks around, sees nobody. His attention is attracted by a whistle.\nHe looks over. A group of three more, similarly armed Farmers emerge from the forest at the other side.\nHe waves at them. They beckon him across.\nHe sets off through the field.\n\nEXT. AMONG PLANTS. DAY.\nThe three inturders continue to crawl along the ground between the plants\nSuddenly Richard stops. The farmer's footsteps come closer.\nHis feet pass in the gap between Richard and Francoise. He pauses. They lie frozen in place. He lights a cigarette and drops the match. He moves on.\nThey breath again. \n\nEXT. EDGE OF FIELD. DAY.\nRichard, Etienne, and Francoise reach the far edge of the field and enter the forest again.\nFRANCOISE\nMy God, what are we doing here?\nETIENNE\nShit. This was not on the map, Richard.\nRICHARD\nI didn't draw the map, Etienne.\nETIENNE\nIt's a fucking mess.\nRICHARD\nI didn't force you to come, so don't blame me.\nFRANCOISE\nWe should go back. It's too dangerous. We shouldn't be here.\nRICHARD\nGo back? How? Swim perhaps? Great idea. Back in the water? Well fuck that. You swim back if you want to. Both of you. I'm not.\nETIENNE\nRichard - she is frightened. So am I.\nRichard looks at them. They await his lead.\nRICHARD\nWell, we're not going back.\nRichard smiles. The other two are still nervous.\nRICHARD (V.O)\nOnce again, I think you'll agree. A moment worth savoring. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. FOREST. DAY.\nThey flit thorugh a lest dense forest, up a slope, looking carefully around as they go.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThe most satisfying aspec, of course, was that Monseigneur Practical, Mr. Timetable, Mr I'll-sort-it-out-with-a-local-fisherman, he turned out to be not so hot in your actual primordial fight or flight situation, your combat zone, where what it takes to stay alive is quick thinking and nerves of steel. I didn't need to say anything. I knew it, and so did he.\nThey reach the top of the hill. Richard looks back. Down below they can see the dope fields.\nThey continue\nEXT. FOREST. DAY.\n\n\nThey are travelling downhill now, beside a stream.\nThey stop to drink from it.\nETIENNE\nIf we follow this down, it should lead us all the way to the lagoon.\nRICHARD\nThat's right, all the way down.\nRICHARD (V. O.)\nHe was right. All we had to do was follow the water and we'd be in paradise. Only I twasn't going to be that easy.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. WATERFALL. DAY.\n\n\nWater thunders from a clifftop to a pool\nEtienne and Francoise are lying flat on a rock, peering over the edge of this high waterfall. It falls in a single giant step.\nOn either side of the waterfall, cliffs curve away to form a massive circle enclosing the lagoon and an area of land covered in forest.\nEtienne crawls back a few paces to where Richard is sitting on a rock. Francoise continues to look over.\nETIENNE\nWell, Richard, how are we going to get down?\nRICHARD\nWhy are you asking me?\nETIENNE\nWhy shouldn't I?\nRICHARD\nBecause you can have an opinion too.\nETIENNE\nI have an opinion\nRICHARD\nOK, so let's hear it.\nFRANCOISE\n\tWe'll jump.\n RICHARD\n\tDon't be stupid. Etienne?\n ETIENNE\n\tWe'll climb down over there.\n RICHARD\n\tThere?\n ETIENNE\n\tSo, what do you think?\n FRANCOISE\n\tListen to me - we can jump.\n RICHARD\n\tNo, if we try to climb there we'll all be killed. Over there looks better.\n ETIENNE\n\tMaybe we could make a rope out of some creepers.\n RICHARD\n\tYes, or maybe we could build a hang glider and a giant staircase.\n FRANCOISE\n\t(Shouting)\n\tPlease!\n\tThey turn to her. She is standing with her back to the drop.\n RICHARD\n\tWhat?\n\tShe turns around.\n ETIENNE\n\tNo!\n\tShe jumps.\n\tShe falls towards and into the pool.\n\tRichard and Etienne scramble to the edge and peer over.\n\tShe surfaces and waves.\n\tRichard and Etienne look at each other.\n RICHARD\n\tOK, so we'll jump.\n\n\nEXT. WATERFALL. DAY.\n\nRichard and Etienne jump.\n\tThey sink and then surface.\nAll three are ecstatic and elated, charged with the excitement of the fall and the joy of a journey's end. They exchange hugs and kisses.\nThey become aware of a single person clapping slowly.\nThey turn to see Keaty, a young Afro-Caribbean Londoner, standing a few paces away.\nKEATY\nCongratulation. It took me the best part of an hour to work up the balls to do that. Mind you, I was alone, so you have to make allowances.\nThey say nothing.\nKEATY\n(continuing)\nI'm Keaty.\nRICHARD\nAre there many people here?\nKeaty raises a hand to stop Richard's question.\nKEATY\nThe Q and A comes later. First of all, I think you'd better meet Sal.\n\n\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. DAY.\nSal, a woman in her early thirties, is seated on the floor opposite Richard, Francoise, and Etienne.\nSal is studying Daffy's map. She hands it back to Richard.\nGathered around them are about twenty assorted inhabitants of various nationalities, all weathered travelers in their twenties or thirties.\nThe longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized, others not. There is also an open area where this action takes place.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAt first they were more interested in the map than us. It seems that Daffy, the guy who drew it, he was a founding father, he discovered this places and set up the community five years ago. Then about one year ago he starts to get depressed, six months later he leaves and that's the last they hear till we turn up.\nRICHARD\nHe's dead. He cut his wrists open in a hotel room on the Khao San Road. The police didn't know what to do with the body. I guess they'll incinerate him or something.\nSAL\nDo you tink he gave a mpa like this to anyone else.\nRICHARD\nI don't know. I don't think so.\nSAL\nAnd you, have you told anyone or shown anyone this map?\nETIENNE\nNo.\nFRANCOISE\nNo.\nRICHARD\nNo.\nSAL\nGood.\n\nEXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY/NIGHT.\n\n\nCommence a montage of various scenes of island life involving its citizens and the newcomers.\nThe longhouse stands at one edge of a clearing, dominating it. Scattered around are several other smaller huts and a few tents. Other locations are the beach, the garden, and the forest.\nWe see the inhabitants\n\nat work in the garden \nin the lagoon \nrelaxing on the beach \naround the fire at night\n\n\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nNow I've got to say that my first impressions were not favorable. Oh God, I thought, it's a tribe of hippies. I thought we'd have to talk about our positive energies a lot, kiss the earth every morning and recycle our waste products by some unspeakable mechanism. Fortunately not. It really was some kind of a paradise. We grew some fruit and some dope. The farmers on the other side left us alone and we didn't trespass on their turf.\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. DAY\nEveryone, including Francoise, Etiennne and Richard is sitting around a big wooden table set for dinner. Two people are serving side dishes of vegetables and rice.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nSal was the leader but it wasn't a big deal. There wasn't any ideology or shit like that, it was just a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts.\nOne man begins drumming softly on the table with his hands. Another joins in, then another. Soon everyone is tapping out a rhythm, against the table or a bottle or a coconut shell, using their hands or a knife or chopsticks.\nThis is intercut with the following scene to the point where the newcomers have joined in and it reaches a crescendo as the main dish -a massive complete swordfish, is served.\n\nEXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY.\nVarious characters are introduced in different locations; at work or at rest; speaking to Richard or (as if to him) to camera.\nFirst the three Swedes.\nRICHARD(V.O.)\nThere was the Swedes: Christo, Sten, and Karl.\nCHRISTO\nWe like fishing\nKARL\nFishing. Yeah.\nSTEN\nYeah.\nCHRISTO\nAnd in the winter we like skiing.\nKARL\nYeah.\nSTEN\nYeah.\nCHRISTO\nBut in Thailand - there is no skiing.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThen there were the Yugoslavian girls.\nSONJA\nWe are from Sarajevo.\nMIRJANA\nOur hearts are full of loss\nRICHARD\nI'm sorry.\nThey start laughing at him\nSONJA\nIt's alright.\nMIRJANA\nWe tell everyone that.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThere was the Weathergirl.\nWEATHERGIRL\nI feel a tightness in my pelvis; it's gonna rain.\nHeavy rain falls.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd yes, unfortunately, there was a man with a guitar.\nGUITARMAN\n(singing badly)\n\"Come as you are, as you were, and as I want you to be\u0085\"\nRICHARD(V.O.)\nThe only person I didn't like was Sal's boyfriend, Bugs. He was one of those pricks who just won't shut up about all the great things they've seen and done, all of which are just that little bit better, bigger, more dangerous, more extreme, more remote, more unusual, more thi more that more fucking everything than anything you've ever done.\nBUGS\nWe were in the dessert for three weeks. It's forty-eight in the shade and there's bugger all of that to speak of. We're on one and half liters a day; it's practically suicide. But every morning we'd look east and see the sunrise, and I'd thing, if I die today - it's worth it.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThe local diet was pretty good and most evenings we'd smoke some dope. Most afternoons too, as a matter of fact, but I had a personal rule never to smoke before lunch, although as time went on I allowed myself a certain number of - special occasions\".\nRichard smokes dope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. DAY.\nThe drumming reaches its crescendo and the swordfish is laid out.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThis became our world. Pretty soon nothing else mattered anymore: family, friend, future achievements - who cares. Back home was just standing behind a counter all day wearing a stupid fucking hat saying, \"how can I help you sir, eat in or take away?\" All gone, all faded away. I settled in. I found my vocation.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nRichard, Etienne, and Francoise are standing in waist-deep water. Each is holding a bamboo spear.\nTheir hair is longer and their tans deeper than when they arrived.\nThey are watching Christo who stands a short distance away, spear poised for the kill while he talks through the process.\nCHRISTO\nOK. Now you stand still. You wait. The fish come. You wait until the fish are still. They trust you. You wait.\nHis speech is hypnotic, calming. His students take in the view.\nCHRISTO\n(continuing)\nAnd then-\nHe suddenly throws the spear into the water. He lifts it out triumphant.\nCHRISTO\n(continuing) \nYou kill\nA dying fish wriggles on the end of the spear.\nCHRISTO\n(continuing)\nNow, you try.\nRichard, Etienne and Francoise wade apart a little and into deeper water. They wait and look.\n\nEXT. UNDERWATER. DAY & EXT. SURFACE. DAY.\nTheir feet and legs are visible. At first nothing is happening, then a few fish swim into view.\nRichard throws and misses. The other two throw and miss.\nCHRISTO\nNo, no, no. Too fast. Slowly.\nThey pause\nRichard throws. He hauls his spear from the water.\nRICHARD\nYo!\nA decent sized fish wriggles on the end.\nCHRISTO\nYou are a natural!\nThey all congratulate him.\nRichard raises the spear aloft.\nRICHARD\nAnd I say unto you: I shall provide.\n\nEXT. CLEARING. DAY\nA bamboo spear, loaded with fish like a giant kebab, is carried across the clearing towards the cooking area wehre the chef and his helpers are at work.\nThe spear is held by richard who smiles as he deposits the fish on the broad wooden chopping surface.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nThat's right, I had an aptitude, a hidden talent. All these years I'm good for nothing, turns out I'm a full-on old fashioned hunter fucking gatherer.\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. DAY\nAs Richard enters there are only a few people inside.\nHe walks to the partitioned area and looks for a packet of cigarettes among his possessions.\nOpposite to him, Keaty is lying down, reading the Bible.\nKEATY\nAh, the hunter gatherer returns. Satisfied with a good day's killing amongst the fruits of the sea?\nRICHARD\nThat's me: a good day's killing.\nKEATY\nGod has smiled on you.\nRICHARD\nHe has?\nKEATY\nHe has made you sharp of eye and swift of limb. In other words, you catch a lot of fish, you'll be very popular around here.\nRICHARD\nGreat.\nKEATY\nDon\u0092t forget to thank Him, will you?\nRICHARD\nI'll try.\nKEATY\nHe'd appreciate that. Anyway, first day's fishing, first day's catch, you lot are just about ready to join the community.\nRICHARD\nI thought we already had.\nKEATY\nNot yet baptized, my son, not yet baptized.\n\nEXT. CLEARING. NIGHT\nA blade burns in the fire.\nKeaty lifts the knife from the fire.\nThe entire community is assembled, watching. \nHe takes Etienne's wrist.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nEvery society must have its rituals. They're what binds you together, they tell you that you belong. Ours was simple. Last one to arrive tattoos the next.\nKEATY\nIt hurts. OK?\nEtienne nods.\nKeaty swiftly cuts the simple symbol just below Etienne's shoulder and smears blue powder into the cut.\nEtienne winces.\nKeaty finishes and hands the knife to Etienne who heats the blade briefly in the fire before he turns to Francoise. He kisses her arm before he cuts.\nFrancoise takes the knife.\nRichard offers his arm. She grips it tightly. She hesitates.\nHe looks into her eyes.\nShe cuts. He grimaces. She works on, holding his arm.\n\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nA few candles still burn as people prepare to turn in for the night. Richard is lying in his sleeping area. He is watching Francoise.\nShe is standing, visible only from the waist up above a partition. She is inspecting her tattoo.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAll the excitement of arrival had given me something to think about, but it wasn't enough to displace my major preoccupation. You can go to the most beautiful place in the world, but the sunlight shall not bleach they passion, nor the tide wash away thy desire.\nA hand. Etienne's appears from below, beckoning her down.\nShe takes the hand.\nJust for a moment her eyes meet Richard's and then she lowers herself towards the ground, disappearing from view.\nThe last candle is extinguished.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nA game of soccer is in progress, involving most of the population, men and woman.\nEtienne is playing well.\nA few people, not involved in the game, are scattered along the beach, relaxing. Amongst these are Francoise and Richard, who is watching the game.\nRICHARD\nHe's good.\nFRANCOISE\nWho?\nRICHARD\nEtienne. He's good at soccer.\nFRANCOISE\nOh, I wouldn't know.\nRICHARD\nYou don't like soccer?\nFRANCOISE\nNo. It's so boring.\nRICHARD\nYea, but he is good. Look. Nearly scored.\nFRANCOISE\nIs that good or bad?\nRICHARD\nI think it's good. Not that I think there's anything good about being good at soccer. Anyone could do that. I could do it if I wanted to. I just don't want to. That's all.\nShe sits up.\nFRANCOISE\nRichard.\nRICHARD\nYes?\nFRANCOISE\nWhat are you talking about?\nRICHARD\nI don't know. Just conversation.\nFRANCOISE\nDo you have a girlfriend?\nRICHARD\nHere?\nFRANCOISE\nAnywhere\nRICHARD\nNo. Why?\nFRANCOISE\nJust conversation.\nRICHARD\nI'm not jealous, if that's what you're thinking.\nFRANCOISE\nNo, it's what you are thinking. You are far from home. You meet a girl. It's exciting, why not? You are attracted to her - it's in your eyes. Perhaps in hers as well. So you think something might happen; it's easy to believe, it's exciting. But she has a boyfriend so you are jealous. Don't worry. It's natural. Now I have seen enough football. Shall we swim?\nRichard is stunned.\nRICHARD\nSo would I be wrong?\nFRANCOISE\nWhat?\nRICHARD\nIf I thought something might happen - would I be wrong?\nShe touches him.\nFRANCOISE\nRichard, how would I know? I don't know any more than you.\nShe walks away.\nRichard watches her go. He turns to the football.\nEtienne scores.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd that's all it takes. Nothing more than a few words and the softest touch and your life is different, won't ever be the same again. Man dies, leaves you the mystery map to the secret island: happens every day. But you get a smile from someone you want: well that's special, that's worth the journey.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nRichard is sitting in his bed.\nHe is watching Francoise in conversation with Keaty across the other side of the room. During Richards (V.O.) their conversation ends and Keaty walks away, leaving Francoise momentarily alone.\nMost of the population is present in the room. Sal is reading.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI would have liked to have continued our discussion, to thrash out the details of our forthcoming affair, but every time I had the chance to catch her alone, something always got in the way.\nFrancoise is alone now. Richard is about to move across when the center of the room is occupied by commotion.\nAt the heart of this are Bugs, and an Italian man, Gregorio. Bugs is holding a pair of pliers. Gregorio is in pain.\nRichard watches.\nBUGS\nI can deal with it!\nGREGORIO\nI don't want you to deal with it.\nBUGS\nIt won't take a minute.\nGREGORIO\nNo! Please, no! I must go to the mainland.\nOnlookers join in.\nVARIOUS\nNo way/ You can't go to the mainland/ No, etc.\nGREGORIO\nSal!\nSal looks up for the first time.\nSAL\nSorry, I wasn't really tuned in. You want to go to the mainland? To see a dentist, is that it?\nGREGORIO\nYes.\nSal is casual but firm.\nSAL\nNo. It's out of the question.\nShe returns to the book.\nWith help from two or three other people, Bgs drags Gregorio to the floor and rips out the offending tooth with a pair of pliers. Gregorio screams.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI was sort of disturbed by this, but really only by the method, by the way that Bugs handled it. But the guy couldn't leave; I could see that. When you have something secret, everyone's got to take responsibility to keep it that way.\nFrancoise has gone.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY\nA tropical lightening storm is in progress.\nAt the edge of the beach, Christo, Richard, Sten, and Karl are standing under the ineffectual shelter of a palm tree, ecah holding their spear. A short distance away, under anotehr tree, sit Francoise and Etienne, hand in hand.\nThey are all contemplating the sea and the sky. Christo has a swimming mask and a snorkel.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nIn any case, I was more concerned about the Francoise situation. After such a promising start, it just didn't seem to be reaching its natural conclusion. In truth it was beginning to annoy me; I mean what's the use of being in paradise if you can't have whatever you want. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the whole idea?\nCHRISTO\nThe problem is seeing the fish. With the rain and the poor light, they are very difficult to catch. It could last for days. Sometimes when it rains, we get hungry.\nRICHARD\nHey, Etienne, you going fishing?\nETIENNE\nI don't know, maybe if - \nRICHARD\nDon\u0092t' worry. You just sit there. I'll go, OK? I'll go. You just sit there.\nHe takes the mask and snorkel from Christo and marches down towards the sea.\nETIENNE\nGood luck\nRichard looks back at them but says nothing. He pulls the mask on and resumes his march into the sea.\n\nEXT. LAGOON. DAY. AND UNDERWATER. DAY.\nRichard swims along near the sea-bed past rocks and coral but can see no fish.\nHe surfaces and swims further out.\nHe hears shouts from the shore. He turns and treads water.\nThe shouts from his colleagues are indistinct, carried away by the wind and the rain.\nRICHARD\n(Shouting)\nI can't hear.\nHe takes the mask off to clean the lens.\nRICHARD\n(Continuing)\nAnd you can't hear me.\nHe puts the mask back on and turns away from the shore.\nHe freezes.\nThere is a shark's fin in the water, moving towards him.\nHe looks around. The shore seems far away. He starts swimming frantically towards it.\nThe shark closes in.\nRichard submerges and turns to face the shark.\nThe shark approaches head on. It is about five feet long with the appropriate teeth.\nRichard is terrified, convinced he is about to die.\nThe shark swoops towards him at speed.\nIt stops, its teeth centimeters from his mask. It pauses then flicks its tail and swims past Richard.\nHe is astonished.\nIt circles him and approaches again, pausing just in front.\nTentatively, Richard raises a hand.\nThe shark does not react.\nRichard pats it gently on its snout.\nIt swims around him again.\nRichard sees small fish swimming around him. He spears one and holds it out on the tip of his spear.\nThe shark snatches it off and repeats its circle but does not threaten Richard.\nHe smiles.\nAs it approaches again, he holds the spear in both hands and lowers it by his side.\nThe shark bobs in front of him, curious and friendly.\nRichard's arms begin their forward motion as his V.O. commences.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI ducked to one side, then to the other as it passed me. First on my left, then on my right. \n\n\n INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nGrilled shark steaks have been passed around and eaten by all while Richard stands and relates his adventure. He cannot resist a glance at Francoise, who listens with rapt attention.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nBut it could see that I was getting tired, so I stood my ground as he swam in for his final attack.\n\n EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY. \nContinuing the shark scene.\nThe shark is bobbin in front of him, practically wagging its tail. \nRichard is smiling.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd at that instant, it was either the shark or me. The shark knew it, I knew it.\nRichard's arms flex. The spear travels up. It stops. Richard grips the spear tightly as it shakes.\nBlood spurts out towards Richards' mask in pulses and the sea turns red around him.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nNothing personal, of course. It's the way of nature. But I swear that in the last flicker of its dying eyes there was a moment between us, when it said -\n\n INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nRichard continues his story.\nRICHARD\n\"Hey Richard - enjoy your dinner.\"\nThere are cheers to the end of his story.\nBugs waits until these die down.\nBUGS\nStrange thing, killing a shark, isn't it?\nRICHARD\nJust a big fish, Bugs.\nBUGS\nJust a big fish? Maybe. Maybe when it's still a baby and it hasn't really learned to kill yet, then maybe it's just a big fish. But when it's a great white angry mother with the taste of human blood on its tongue, well then it's a different story.\nRichard yawns noisily. Some people laugh.\nHe notice Bugs scowling at him.\nRICHARD\nSorry, Bugs. Is it just me or does this wet weather make everybody tired? Maybe we can hear your \"very different\" and I'm sure \"very fascinating\" story some other time.\nThere is a flurry of exaggerated yawning, sniggering, extinguishing of candles and calls of \"goodnight\".\nBugs does not laugh. He stares at Richard.\nRichard is smiling as he extinguishes the final candle.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nA sunny day. A game of cricket, under the supervision of Keaty, is about to begin.\nKEATY\nWicketkeeper. First slip. Second slip. Gully. Square leg. Long leg. Silly mid-off. Cover point.\nAt low tide, two sets of cricket stumps have been set up on the beach some twenty yards apart. The stumps and bats have been roughly hewn.\nAt one end, Sten stands with a bat, ready to defend his stumps. At the other end stands Keaty, who is umpiring. Behind them, the bowler warms up, holding a small rubber ball.\nAmong the ten fielders are Etienne and Francoise.\nRichard, the second batsman, walks toward Keaty, practicing with an air of exuberance.\nKEATY \n(Continuing)\nWe thank you Lord, for the twin pillars of civilization, Christianity and cricket, even when played by those of another faith., Amen. Ok, right arm over the wicket; first ball.\nThe bowler runs up and bowls. Sten hits the ball and it is fielded for no run at leaisurly pace by Etienne. Keaty and Richard watch.\nKEATY\n(Continuing)\nYou do realize that killing a defenseless shark won't make any difference.\nRICHARD\nDifference to what?\nKEATY\nYou and Francoise, that's what.\nRICHARD\nSorry Keaty, but I don't know what you're talking about.\nKEATY\nThat is why you killed it, isn't it? Ducked one way then the other! All to impress her, I suppose.\nThe second ball is bowled and fielded.\nKEATY\n(Continuing)\nBut you haven't got a chance in hell. I'm not saying you won't get a quick fumble in her knickers down the back of the longhouse but in the long run.\nThird ball\nRICHARD\nI don't need to discuss this with you.\nKEATY\nNo ball!\nRICHARD\nAlso, you're wrong.\nThird ball re-bowled and hit well.\nKEATY\nFour runs!\nHe turns back to Richard.\nKEATY\n(continuing)\nRichard, you are a novelty act. He is the main attraction.\nRICHARD\nThank you for your opinion, Father.\nFourth ball.\nKEATY\nI don't mean to bring you down. I just wouldn't want anyone to get hurt\nRICHARD\nIf you don't shut up, you're the one that's going to get hurt.\nSilence\nKEATY\nOne other thing.\nRICHARD\nWhat?\nKEATY\nHe's better looking than you.\nRICHARD\nThanks.\nFifth ball bowled and hit. The batsmen both run, Richard and Sten exchanging places.\nRichard prepares to face the bowler\nKEATY\nRight arm over the wicket. One ball remaining.\nThe ball is bowled. Richard hits it in the air.\nKEATY\nCatch it! Catch it!\nEtienne catches it.\nKeaty signals \"out\".\nRichard walks away from the wicket, past Keaty and the celebrating fielders, Francoise among them, who have gathered around Etienne.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nRichard reaches the fringe of the beach where Sal is sitting alone, half watching the game.\nSAL\nAren't you going to stay and watch the game?\nRICHARD\nNo. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go for a long walk.\nSAL\nDon't forget about this evening. You wouldn't want to miss it.\nRICHARD\nWhy? What happens this evening? Another obscure English sport with which to humiliate the Americans?\nSAL\nIt's the anniversary, Richard.\n\n\n\nEXT. CLEARING. NIGHT.\nA pair of hands, Sten's, tap loud and fast on a small drum.\nThe inhabitants are sitting in a group. They are all holding half coconut shells.\nSonja walks along with a large clay bottle, filling each shell with a milky liquid.\nSal is standing up.\nThe drumming stops.\nSAL\nTo the first six years.\nThey all drink.\nRichard cringes at the unpleasant taste.\nBeside him, Etienne proudly gulps down the whole drink.\nSonja refills the cups, pouring freely.\nSAL\n(continuing)\nAnd looking forward to the next one.\nThey all drink again.\nOnce again, Richard sips while Etienne empties his cup.\nRICHARD\nSo who was actually the first here?\nSAL\nWell, technically, Daffy was the first person on the island.\nRICHARD\nSo why did he leave?\nThere is an immediate silence.\nSAL\nWhat?\nRICHARD\nWhy did Daffy leave? What made him unhappy?\nThe silence persists.\nRICHARD\n(continuing)\nSorry. Have I broken a rule?\nSAL\nNo, Richard, don't worry. Daffy left because he felt that in coming to paradise we had inevitably destroyed it.\nRICHARD\nBecause you built a shelter.\nSAL\nHe was a purist.\nMIRJANA\nHe was crazy.\nThere is a general murmur of agreement.\nRICHARD\nMust have been.\nThe atmosphere is still slightly awkward.\nGuitarman breaks the silence by plunging into a rendition of a popular favorite.\nSonja refills the cups.\nOnce again, Etienne tilts back his head and drinks.\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nThe longhouse is empty. Outside a different, slower tune is being played.\nThe door is kicked open.\nRichard struggles in, carrying Etienne draped over his shoulder.\nFrancoise follows.\nRichard lets Etienne slide off onto his bed where he lies, inert and comatose.\nFRANCOISE\nLook at him. It's disgraceful to drink so much.\nRICHARD\nI think he just got carried away with the excitement of the occasion.\nFRANCOISE\nDon't make excuses for him. I'm so embarrassed. \nRICHARD (V.O.)\nNow, I thought, this si my moment. It's now or never. Now or never. Now or -\nRICHARD\nFrancoise -\nFRANCOISE\nRichard, would you like to go tot the beach with me.\nRICHARD\nYes!\n\n EXT BEACH. NIGHT.\nRichard and Francoise walk down the shore to the moonlit sea.\nFrancoise wades in up to her thighs. Richard follows.\nFRANCOISE\nDo you like it here, Richard?\nRICHARD\nI love this island.\nFRANCOISE\nDo you think about home?\nRICHARD\nNo.\nFRANCOISE\nNor do I. Do you think that I ignore you?\nRICHARD\nMe? No.\nFRANCOISE\nIt's because I am with Etienne. It's difficult to spend time with you.\nRICHARD\nI don't suppose there's any special reason that you should, spend time with me, that is.\nFRANCOISE\nOf course there is: I like you, a lot.\nRICHARD\nAnd have you mentioned this to Etienne.\nFRANCOISE\nNo. It's our secret.\nThey are very close now, looking into each others' eyes. \nSuddenly Francoise looks away.\nFRANCOISE\n(continuing)\nThere!\nRICHARD\nWhat?\nFRANCOISE\nLook! The plankton. Shrimps. In the dark, when they are disturbed, they glow.\nShe dives in. He follows.\nUNDERWATER. NIGHT.\nTheir faces, close together, are illuminated by the phosphorescent plankton.\n\n EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\nThey surface, kissing passionately.\n\nEXT. CLEARING. DAY.\nUnder a shelter in the cooking area, the Chef walks up to two sacks of rice and slashes them open.\nHe picks out two clumps of green, rotten mush and holds them out towards Sal who stands nearby.\n\nEXT. CLEARING. DAY\nThe inhabitants of the community are sprawled around the area, generally facing towards Sal who addresses them. Francoise is sitting with Etienne but turns to acknowledge Richard with a smile at some stage.\nSAL\nAlright, I've got some bad news. As some of you may have heard, a couple of sacks of rice have gone rotten. Now this is not a disaster - \nVARIOUS\nOh, no.\nSAL\nYes, that's right: I need a volunteer to go to Ko Pha Ngan with me to buy some rice. So please don't all volunteer at once.\nThere are no volunteers. Everyone avoids Sal's eye.\nSAL\n(continuing)\nKeaty?\nKEATY\nI went two months ago.\nSAL\nAnd so did I. Anyone else?\nStill no volunteers.\nSAL\n(continuing)\nRichard?\nRichard has been scrutinizing Francoise's back.\nRICHARD\nWhat?\nSAL\nWhat about you? Will you come to Ko Pha Ngan with me?\nRICHARD\nSure. Yea. I'll come with you.\nSAL\nGreat.\nShe smiles at him.\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. DAY\nRichard is sitting on his mat with a pencil and a piece of paper. A line of people wait to pass him some crumpled baht and their order.\nTheir recitals overlap.\nMAN 1\nToothbrush, toothpaste, sixty cigarettes, a new hat, some elastoplast, a pair of swimming trunks, four bars of chocolate and some razors.\nWOMAN 1\nOne hundred aspirin, one hundred paracetamol, six boxes of regular tampons, toothpaste, soap and some shampoo.\nMAN 2\nToothpaste, a ball of string, four double-A batteries, and twenty condoms. No, make it forty.\nWOMAN 2\nSix bars of chocolate, moisturizer, four boxes of tampons, assorted sixes, two bars of soap and some toothpaste.\nMAN 3\nOne tin of beef curry.\nWOMAN 3\nA newspaper, some boiled sweets, shampoo and conditioner, two hundred cigarettes, a pair of plastic sandals, small, a new swimsuit, size ten, bright but no flowers, a plain T-shirt, a jar of Vegemite and three cigarette lighters.\nThe last to sit down opposite Richard is Bugs. He sits close, their knees almost touching.\nRichard is posed with his pen, ready to take note.\nRICHARD\nAnything I can do for you?\nBugs smiles.\nHis right arm whips out and he grabs Richard by the testicles.\nRichard buckles forward in pain.\nBUGS\nYeah. When you get to Ko Pha Ngan, keep your hands to yourself and your dick in your pants.\nHe releases Richard.\nPreplexed and in pain Richard watches Bugs walk away.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nEveryone is asleep.  Track along past the sleeping forms to stop at Richard.\nThe figure looking down at him is Sal.\nEXT. CLEARING. DAWN.\nSal and Richard are walking away from the longhouse in the early morning light.  Sal has a small parcel of cannabis wrapped up in a plastic bag.\nRICHARD\nWhy are we leaving so early.\nSAL\nIf you hang around, people take advantage of you, give you orders for all sorts of shit - clothes, condoms, Vegemite and God knows what else.\nRICHARD\nRight.\nSAL\nWe go to Ko Pha Ngan, sell the dope, buy the rice, and come back.  That's all.\nEXT. BEACH / Water. Day.\nSal walks into the water and begins swimming out towards the cliff.\nRichard watches then dives into the water.\nEXT. LAGOON / CLIFFS. DAY.\nSal waits for Richard as he catches up with her at the base of the cliffs inside the lagoon.\nRICHARD\nOver?\nSAL\nUnder.\nRICHARD\nAnything I should know?\nSAL\nDon't breathe till you get to the other side.\nSal submerges.\nRichard watches her disappear into an underwater tunnel into the rock.\nHe takes a deep breath.,\nUNDERWATER. DAY.\nRichard enters the tunnel, passing from the light into the dark.\nHe enters near total darkness.\nFar ahead is a narrow point of dim light.\nHe swims towards it.\nINT CAVE. DAY.\nRichard surfaces, breathing deeply.  He is in a cave within the cliffs, from which a small entrance opens on to the sea beyond.\nWithin the cave is a large flat rock and moored beside that is a small narrow boat with an outboard motor.\nThe ceiling of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney (which will be in use later).  Additional light enters through this.\nAs Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the boat.\nSAL\nWelcome to the garage.\nShe pulls the start cord.  The small engine's loud roar reverberates around the stone walls.\nEXT. SEA / CLIFFS.  DAY.\nThe small boat emerges from the cave on to the sea, Richard at the front and Sal at the helm.\nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\nBy the light of the moon, they come to land on a deserted stretch of beach.  Richard jumps into the shallows as Sal cuts the engine.\nLights dance in the sky some distance away.\nSal and Richard drag and shove the boat up the beach.\nThe full moon shines brightly.  The insistent beat of dance music is heard.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAll the way I was sort of looking forward to the party, but when we actually got there -\nEXT. BEACH RESORT. NIGHT.\nThe street is lined with bars each pumping out western music on its own sound system.\nRichard and Sal walk along the strip.\nThey turn towards a bungalow complex.  Sal is still carrying the parcel of dope.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\n- I couldn't be bothered.  It all seemed kind of trashy and out of place.  This was why we kept the secret.  If these assholes ever found out about our island they'd take just one night to spoil it forever.\nEXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT.\nThe reception area is covered by an awning.  An old warped pool table stands in the center.  Sal and the receptionist, SUMET, greet each other and speak in Thai.  There are no subtitles but when they discus sthe number of rooms they indicate with their fingers: this is not seen by Richard.\nSAL\nGood evening.\nSUMET\nGood evening, how are you?\nSAL\nVery well, thank you.\nSUMET\nYou brought something?\nSAL\nAs always.\nSal puts the parcel on the desk.  Sumet weighs it in her hand.\nSUMET\nGood.\nSAL\nWe'd like to stay one night.\nSUMET\nTwo rooms?\nSAL\nOne.\nSumet looks at Richard.\nSUMET\nA good choice.  Young and strong.\nShe squeezes his arm and laughs.\nSAL\nShe says she's got two rooms.  No problem.\nRICHARD\nGreat.\nINT. PHONE BOOTH. NIGHT.\nRichard is in one of a line of booths in an international call office/general tourist store.\nRICHARD\nI don't know.  I just don't know.  Maybe this year, maybe not.  I like it here.  Things are different out here.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI phoned home and discovered that I couldn't communicate.  I realized that I was no longer the person they knew.\nRICHARD\nYou don't understand.\nHe hangs up.\nHe steps out of the booth.  On the other side of the store are racks of patterned shirts and hats.\nRichard walks across and stares just beyond them.\nHe is looking in a mirror, at himself, tanned and weathere-beaten.\nINT.SUPERMARKET. NIGHT.\nRichard browses, selecting the items on his list, then spending time choosing soap, eventually opting for a brand marked \"Genuine French Soap\".\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nIn fact the more I thought about it the more I realized that none of this world made any sense to me.  I'd left it behind.  We all had, and in its place we'd found somewhere special, and we were determined to keep it that way.\nHe drops the \"French\" soap in his basket.\nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\nThe music is far away now.  Richard and Sal struggle along the deserted beach to their boat carrying a pallet laden with sacks of rice.\nThey arrive and drop the pallet.\nRICHARD\nNow I understand why no one wants to come for the rice.\nINT/ EXT. BAR. NIGHT.\nThe bar opens out to a street just back from the beach.  It is busy.\nSal and Richard stand at the bar with their drinks.\nSAL\nSo how does it feel to be back in the world?\nRICHARD\nIt's not like I remembered it.\nSAL\nIt gets worse every time.\nA hand rests on Richard's shoulder, gently pushing him aside to create space at the bar.  It is Zeph.\nZEPH\nExcuse me, please.\nHe does not see Richard's face but concentrates on the barman.\nRichard recognizes him and conceals his face.\nZEPH\n(continuing)\nExcuse me!  Four beers please.  Heinneken.\nThe barman serves him.\nSammy and two German girls stand behind Zeph.  He passes the drink back to them and turns to speak.\nRichard and Sal listen in.\nZEPH\n(Continuing)\nOK, where was I?\nSAMMY\nThe beach.\nZEPH\nRight, the beach: it's on this secret island, in the middle of the national park where no one is allowed to go.  It's paradise.\nGIRL 1\nSounds cool.\nZEPH\nWhat's even better is we got the map of how to get there.\nGIRL 1\nCan we see it?\nSAMMY\nSure.  Let's go back to our place.  We can smoke some dope, drink some beer, loosen off these tight clothes we're wearing, then check out the map.\nZEPH\nBut hey it's secret - if we show you the map, you have to come with us.\nThey laugh.  Zeph and Sammy high-five each other.\nZEPH\n(continuing)\nBack in a minute.  Just going to conduct a recon of the local sanitation facility.\nRichard watches him leave the bar.\nEXT. TOILET. NIGHT.\nThe toilet is a narrow concrete passage with a ditch along the bottom on one side.  There is no roof but a single light above.\nZeph is just finishing as he notices Richard.\nZEPH\nHey, Richard! I hardly fucking recognize you. Where have you been?  The beach?  Tell me - it's paradise.\nRICHARD\nThere is no beach.\nZEPH\nWhat?\nRICHARD\nThe map is wrong.\nZEPH\nYou've been?\nRICHARD\nNo. it's dangerous.\nZEPH\nDanger - hey, you're calling my middle name.  What kind of danger?\nRICHARD\nDoesn't matter.\nZEPH\nI think you're trying to put me off.\nRICHARD\nI'm just telling you, for your own good: stay away.  Don't go. Don't even try.  Just forget it.\nZEPH\nWe'll do whatever we want.\nHe goes to leave.  Richard places a hand on his chest.  They stop for a moment.  Zeph pushes the hand away.\nZEPH\n(continuing)\nFuck you.\nZeph walks past then turns back.\nZEPH\n(continuing)\nStay away from the mushrooms, Richard, they make you paranoid.\nEXT. BECH / STEPS. NIGHT.\nRichard and Sal are climbing the steps towards the bungalow reception.\nSAL\nThat idiot Daffy? What was he doing - handing out Xerox copies to every asshole in Thailand?\nRICHARD\nYeah, it's unbelievable.\nSAL\nWhy? That's all I want to know. Why?\nRICHARD\nI don't know, Sal.\nSAL\nPardon me for this, but thank Christ he's dead.\nEXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT.\nRichard and Sal enter from the steps.  Behind them the party is still in progress.\nSal approaches the desk while Richard hangs back.\nShe greets Sumet who hands over one key.\nSAL\nBad news.\nRICHARD\nWhat?\nSAL\nShe gave away your room.  She thought we were - you know - together.  Sorry.\nRICHARD\nRight.  Great.  Well I'll go find somewhere else then.  I'll meet you back here in the morning.\nSAL\nRichard.\nShe shows him the key for the room.\nThey look at each other.\nSAL \n(continuing)\nI'm going to play a couple of games of pool with Sumet.\nShe throws the key.  He catches.\nSAL\n(continuing)\nWhy don't you go warm the bed?\nINT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.\nThe room is in darkness.  Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain.  The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net.\nThe music from the beach party is audible.\nJust visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined.\nEXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.\nLizards scuttle across the small porch.\nINT. BED. NIGHT.\nSurrounded by a wall of mosquito net, Richard and Sal lie on the bed.\nSal lies on her side falling asleep. Richard is awake.\nRICHARD\nSal.\nSAL\nUh-huh.\nRICHARD\nCan I ask you a question?\nSAL\nIt was great.\nRICHARD\nNo, it's not that.  I just wondered about Bugs.  And me.\nSal rouses herself.\nSAL\nOK, it's like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my partner, and you, you're someone I just screwed.  Is that ok?\nShe turns on her side again.\nRICHARD\nThat's fine.  That's absolutely fine.\nSAL\nGood, now get some sleep - I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nRichard and Sal push the boat into the water and away from the beach, jumping on board as they do so.\nEXT. SEA/CLIFFS. DAY.\nRichard and Sal approach the outer cliffs of the sea-wall in the boat.  Richard looks up.\nBugs is standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the cave.\nINT CAVE. DAY.\nThe sacks of rice are now contained in a net being hauled upwards on a rope towards and into the chimney which rises out of the ceiling.\nSal swims away into the tunnel.\nEXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY.\nBugs and Keaty haul the rice up with the aid of a block and tackle.\nINT. CAVE. DAY.\nRichard is alone as he looks up the chimney and watches the cargo disappear the last few feet to the top of the cliff.\nAs it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down.\nRichard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney.\nRichard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nScrewing Sal was pretty good but screwing Bugs - that was even better.\nINT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.\nThe longhouse is full of inhabitants.\nRichard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus despensing toiletries and other gifts as requested.\nHe reaches Francoise alone at the end of the hut.\nHe gives her the \"French\" soap.\nRICHARD\nFor you.\nFRANCOISE\nI missed you.\nRICHARD\nI'm back.\nFRANCOISE\nWhat was it like?\nRICHARD\nThe rice run? No problem.\nFARNCOISE\nI mean being with Sal?\nRICHARD\nOh\u0085fine.  Listen, do you want to go to the beach?\nFRANCOISE\nI can't.  Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock at the waterfall.\nShe touches him as she walks away.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI didn\u0092t' feel as bad as I should have about all this.  In fact I didn't really feel bad at all.  What happened on Ko Pha Ngan was different, it didn't count.\nEXT. FOREST/WATERFALL. DAY.\n\nRichard is on his way to the waterfall.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd I was glad to be back.  Now I really did understand why no one wanted to go for the rice.  Life here was so good that going back to the world we came from could only bring you down.\nHe reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting.  He looks around for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes to ten.\nSAL (O.S.)\nHi there, Richard.\nRichard turns to see Sal, who has appeared as though from nowhere.\nRICHARD\nOh, Sal.  Hi.\nSAL\nHi?  Is that all you can say?  I thought we had a little more rapport than that.\nRICHARD\nI mean, hello, nice to see you.  What brings you here.\nSAL\nI was looking for you.\nRICHARD\nOh.  Well, here I am.\nSAL\nI have to go somewhere.  I'd like you to accompany me.\nRichard checks his watch.\nRICHARD\nRight now?  It's not really all that convenient, Sal.\nSAL\nI'm sorry. Are you meeting someone?\nRICHARD\nMe? No.\nSAL\nYou sure?\nRICHARD\nYes.\nSAL\nGood.  So, you can come with me.\n\u00a0\n(Unfortunately the copy of the script is now missing a page.)\n\u00a0\nSAL\nIf they reach the island, I want you to discourage them from getting any further.\nRICHARD\n\"Discourage.\"\nSAL\nYou'll think of something, Richard.  I trust you.\nSal kisses him on the cheak and leaves.\nRichard watches her go.\nRICHARD\nSal!  How long do I - Sal!\nShe does not turn around.\nRichard turns back towards the other island.\nHe focuses the binoculars.\n\nEXT. BEACH. DAY.\nThe empty beach on the other island.\nEXT. HILLTOP. DAY.\nRichard is not pleased.\nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT.\n\nRichard and Francoise are sitting in the shadows.\nRICHARD\nShe didn't tell me how long I was supposed to wait or anything.  You know what she's like, she just gets you to do things.\nFRANCOISE\nWhat kind of things?\nRICHARD\nJust things, you know.\n \n\n\n\n\nFRANCOISE\nNo, I don't.\nRICHARD\nHey, what's wrong - I'm sorry I wasn't there today. Is that it?\nFRANCOISE\nI think Sal is attracted to you.\nRICHARD\nNo, I don't think so.\nFRANCOISE\nOn Ko Pha Ngan, did anything happen?\nRICHARD\nHappen? No, nothing.\nFRANCOISE\nYou promise.\nRICHARD\nI promise.\nFRANCOISE\nGood.\nThey kiss.\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nOk, so I lied. It just wasn't the right time.\n\n EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. \n Richard sits at the lookout.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd the next day, we couldn't meet up either. It was straight back up. Same \n  scene again: no travelers, no boat, no action, nothing. Now I thought if this \n  is going to be a regulra situation, I'm going to have to start hiding from Sal \n  so I don't have to come up here. But a strange thing happened: I began to \n  enjoy it. I looked forward to it, I started to explore.\n\n EXT. HILL. DAY. \n From a vantage point, Richard looks down on the lagoon, the beach, the \n  forest, and the clearing.\nWith the binoculars he can see the details of life in each of these \n  areas.\n EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. \n Through the binoculars, various characters are at work or at rest including \n  Francoise, Etienne, Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nAnd then I couldn't understand why I'd never come up before. I got a whole \n  new perspective. They were ants, or rats in an experiment, but up here I \n  wasn't part of it, I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. This was my \n  personal adventure playground. There was even a bunch of local bad guys I \n  could fool around with.\n EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. \n Looking through the trees, the four dope farmers (with their guns) are \n  visible about thirty meters away, relaxing and playing cards.\nRichard appears in a tree, hiding from their view, if they cared to \n  look.\nHe steals forward to another tree. He watches them.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nPretty soon, I was starring in my very own war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, \n  or at least about as close to it as I would ever get, considering I was born \n  in 1973. But I knew exactly who I was: renegade special forces officer on a \n  solo mission, search and destroy. I liked the sound of it \"he prefers to work \n  alone,\" they'd say, \"he's got the stare.\"\nThe farmers are oblivious.\nRichard advances as far as he dare: a few meters from them.\nHe peers at them around the edge of the tree.\nHe notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the ground.\nRichard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the farmers.\nAs it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers are startled. \n  They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for their guns, cocking \n  them, etc.\nThe knife is taken by Richard.\nThe farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return \n  to their resting place.\nRichard steals away from tree to tree.\nThe farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone.\n EXT. FOREST. DAY \n Richard sits in a hollow under a rough shelter he as made from palm \n  leaves.\nHe is using the knife to gut a bird of some sort which he then eats \n  raw.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI hadn't entirely forgotten my purpose up here, but I wasn't worried about \n  it. I mean I didn't want one of those bastards turning up with my map sticking \n  out of his pocket, but if they did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a \n  mission, my mission, to defend our island.\n EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. \n Richard watches the empty beach.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nThe only hitch was - the enemy didn't show up. Now it was probably a \n  mistake, but I one day I brought Francoise up. I thought I'd show her \n  around.\n EXT. FOREST. DAY \n Richard struggles through dense undergrowth, followed by \n  Francoise.\n RICHARD\nCome on, just through here. Watch out for the thorns. Here: look.\nBeneath a tree, a few rotting logs are topped off with palm \n  leaves.\n RICHARD\n(continuing)\nWell, what do you think?\n FRANCOISE\nWhat is it?\n RICHARD\nIt's a shelter. I built it. I thought we could move up here. Get away from \n  it all.\n FRANCOISE\nWe?\n RICHARD\nYeah. You'll need to tell Etienne, of course but - \n FRANCOISE\nRichard, it's horrible.\n RICHARD\nPrimitive, yes, but you have to accept some limitation when you go for \n  seclusion like this.\n FRANCOISE\nAnd to eat?\n RICHARD\nWhatever I kill, we'll eat.\nFrancoise laughs.\n FRANCOISE\nEnjoy yourself, Richard. I'll see you later, back in civilizatin.\n RICHARD\nDo you want a mushroom?\n FRANCOISE\nWhat?\n RICHARD\nThey grow here, all over the place. I picked some. Here.\nRichard collects a handful from under the shelter.\nFrancoise does not think this is funny.\n FRANCOISE\nNo thanks.\n RICHARD\nPlease yourself.\nHe swallows one.\nFrancoise turns away. She struggles back through the undergrowth.\nRichard watches her. He swallows a handful of mushrooms.\n EXT. FOREST. DAY. \n Close up: a caterpillar crawls along a green leaf.\nRichard, his pupils dilated, is watching, transfixed.\nHe holds the knife at the end of the leaf.\nThe caterpillar crawls on to the blade.\nRichard sticks his tongue out and swivels the blade around.\nThe caterpillar crawls on to his tongue.\nRichard gently closes his mouth.\nHe swallows.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nWhen you're a highly trained combat machine, you can't allow yourself to be \n  distracted by minor problems in your personal life. And you can't sit around, \n  you have to stay active, otherwise your energy will dissipate. You have to \n  feed the fear.\n EXT. FOREST. NIGHT/DAWN. \n Richard, his face disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of \n  wooden planks and palm leaves under which the four farmers are \n  sleeping.\n INT. EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT/DAWN. \n The shelter is several meters long but shallow and is open down the length \n  of one side.\nThis is the farmers' home on the island.\nIt contains a collection of tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, \n  and bottles of cheap whiskey.\nSpaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on low pallets \n  or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side.\nRichard enters the shelter and surveys the scene.\nHe approaches the nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana \n  which has slipped half off in his sleep.\nVery slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a \n  Kalashnikov-type assult rifle.\nRichard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it.\nHe lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight.\nHe closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the \n  farmer's nose.\nIn his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. \n  Richard withdraws the gun a fraction.\nHis finger strokes the trigger.\nHe moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each \n  sleeping farmer and mouthing \"bang\" as he goes.\nHe returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him.\nThe farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep \n  and wakes slightly.\nHe reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He \n  relaxes and closes his eyes again.\nBehind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on the gun.\nInstead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer's head and puts it on his \n  own.\nNow he produces the knife from the back of his shorts.\nHe kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly.\nAbruptly he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer's \n  head.\nThe blade sinks deep into the wood.\n EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. \n Richard screams as he executes an exhibition dive from the top of the \n  waterfall to the pool below.\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n There is no one on the beach apart from Richard.\nHe walks to the water and dives in.\nHe surfaces and faces the sun.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI was ecstatic. In a fair contest I had infiltrated their command and left \n  my mark. I had fulfilled my potential as a warrior, a soldier, a killer on the \n  loose. I could just imagine them trying to work how the missing knife got \n  home.\nChristo, Sten, and Karl appear walking down the beach with their fishing \n  gear as Richard walks in from the water.\n RICHARD\nHi, guys.\n CHRISTO\nHello Richard.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI couldn't wait to tell Francoise about it.\n EXT. FOREST. DAY. \n Richard's face is slapped twice by Francoise's hand.\nThey are standing in a small clearing not far from the longhouse.\nFrancoise raises her hand to slap him again. He retreats a \n  fraction.\n RICHARD\nDo you want to calm down? I'm trying to tell you about something exciting. \n  I'm trying to share it with you and all you can do is freak out because you \n  don't like where I want to live.\n FRANCOISE\nI don't care about that.\n RICHARD\nNo? Still pissed about the mushrooms. You know Francoise, sometimes you are \n  so uptight.\n FRANCOISE\nYou liked to me. About Sal.\n RICHARD\nOh, that. She told you?\n FRANCOISE\nShe told everyone. She believes in openness and honesty, not like \n  you.\n RICHARD\nCome on, you were two-timing Etienne.\n FRANCOISE\nBecause I liked you. I didn't know you were going to screw Sal twenty-four \n  hours later.\n RICHARD\nWell if you're going to make such a big deal out of it -\n FRANCOISE\nBugs is going to kill you. And you know what - I don't care.\nShe raises her hand and slaps him again.\nRichard does not flinch.\n INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. \n Richard enters the longhouse.\nInside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end.\nWhen they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops.\nOne by one at first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the \n  longhouse, hurrying past Richard at the door.\nRichard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the longhouse.\nRichard smiles. He repeats the gesture that he made when returning with the \n  rice: he clutches his groin and thrusts towards Bugs.\nBugs starts running towards Richard.\nJust as Bugs reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side.\nBugs, cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling \n  over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly and \n  nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow upright \n  supports that run down the middle of the building.\nEventually Bugs has Richard cornered.\nThey face each other, crouched slightly, breathing heavily.\nFrom outside a loud, horrified screaming begins.\nIt carries on and on.\n RICHARD\nDon't you think we ought to go see what the problem is?\nBugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a fraction of a \n  second.\nRichard slugs him in the jaw.\n EXT. CLEARING. DAY. \n Richard emerges from the longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching \n  hand.\nA crowd has gathered as he joins it.\nAt the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing and shouting in Swedish, and \n  Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and looks dead. Despite his appearance, \n  Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to resuscitate him.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nPoor Karl: he didn't speak much English, but he only needed one \nword.\n KARL\nShark! Shark!\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nThey were trying to save Sten's life although even as a novice in this \n  field I could tell that just wasn't going to happen.\nRichard backs away.\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in \n  the sand.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nThe way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming where they \n  live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good at, that's what they do. \n  I could have explained this to Christo but I just knew he wouldn't see \n  it.\nRichard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the \n  sand.\n CHRISTO\nRichard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot!\nRichard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off beneath the \n  knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.\n RICHARD\nYeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad.\nChristo clings to him.\n CHRISTO\nBut it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital?\n RICHARD\nHospital?\n CHRISTO\nTell me - it will be ok.\n RICHARD\nYeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok.\n EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. \n A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.\nThe corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet \n  protruding from the end.\nImmediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.\n KEATY (O.S.)\nWe are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't \n  claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a \n  straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard \n  for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us.\nKeaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is \n  heaped on.\n KEATY\nHe made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played \n  cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I \n  think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. \n  Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you \n  soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.\nKeaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.\nOthers throw flowers in.\nBugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.\n INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. \n Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get \n  him to drink etc.\nSeveral people are sitting around, inactive and silent.\nChristo moans. A couple of people get up and leave.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nAfter the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it just didn't \n  seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem was Christo. You \n  see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important \n  thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone \n  makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get \n  better in which case everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in \n  between that really pisses people off.\n EXT. FOREST. DAY. \n Etienne is backing through the forest. Outraged.\n ETIENNE\nThis is disgusting! You cannot do this! Take him back!\nA party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and Keaty, carry Christo \n  through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled up tent. Richard walks \n  behind.\n SAL\nOk, that's far enough.\nThey lower Christo to the ground.\n ETIENNE\nTake him back, you fucking animals!\nSal drops the tent at Etienne's feet.\nThe part walks away apart from Richard\n ETIENNE\n(continuing)\nFucking bastards!\n INT. SMALL TENT. DAY. \n Christo, delirious, is being nursed by Etienne in the small tent, now \n  situated in the middle of the forest.\nRichard is with him.\n RICHARD\nIt's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't care in \n  the same way as you do. It's a fine distinction, I know.\n ETIENNE\nI understand: they wish he was dead.\n RICHARD\nNo! they've be equally happy if he recovered. They just want an \n  outcome.\n ETIENNE\nHe needs a doctor.\n RICHARD\nYou worked in a hospital.\n ETIENNE\nFor one month, as a cleaner, a domestic.\n RICHARD\nWell that's one month longer than anyone else around here. Look, you're \n  doing your best for the guy. No one could ask for more. Everyone apprecaites \n  that.\n ETIENNE\nLook, Richard!\nEtienne draws back the sheet covering Christo's discolored stump.\nRichard recoils.\n RICHARD\nJesus!\n ETIENNE\nIt's gangrene. It's spreading. He needs an amputation.\nEtienne produces a knife from his possessions.\n RICHARD\nYou're going to do it here?\n ETIENNE\nWhere else?\n RICHARD\nOK! I'll hold him still.\nEtienne prepares to proceed, but at the last moment he cannot.\nHe drops the knife\nRichard relaxes.\n\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n People are playing and relaxing on the beach and in the water, shouting and \n  swimming.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nIt would be a lot easier to condemn our behavior if it hadn't been so \n  effective, but out of sight really was out of mind. The bad smell was gone - \n  it was like we had amputated Christo from our community and after the \n  operation was over, we felt a whole lot better.\n UNDERWATER. DAY.\nIn water one meter deep, moving forward with a smooth side-to-side action, \n  the POV of some underwater creature.\nSmall fish scatter ahead of it.\nSuddenly a pair of legs come into view: they are Francoise'.\nClose right in on them at speed.\n EXT. SEA. DAY. \n Francoise screams as Richard surfaces beside her, laughing.\n FRANCOISE\nRichard!\n RICHARD\nJust when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.\n FRANCOISE\nThat's not funny.\n RICHARD\nHey, relax, just a joke. What's wrong with you?\n FRANCOISE\nNo, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you stop them moving Christo?\n RICHARD\nFrancoise I just thought we ought to spend some time together. We haven't \n  had a chance to talk, and let's face it, it's going to be a lot easier for us \n  to do that if Etienne isn't hanging around the longhouse.\n FRANCOISE\nI don't believe it. You really think it was alright to move him.\n RICHARD\nHe was getting everyone down.\n FRANCOISE\nI don't know what has happened to you, Richard.\n RICHARD\nI like it here! That's what happened! So what's the problem?\nFrancoise turns and walks away.\nRichard calls after her sarcastically.\n RICHARD\n(continuing)\nWe do still have something going don't we?\nShe does not reply.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nSo, it seemed that Francoise and I were finished. Under other circumstances \n  I might have got depressed about a think like that, but I had something else \n  to occupy my mind.\n\n\n\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n Seen through binoculars, Zeph walks along the beach on the other island. He \n  is carrying a large piece of driftwood.\nHe turns away from the water and walks up the beach towards the line of \n  palm trees.\nThere he joins Sammy and the two German girls who are constructing \n  something from driftwood and polystryrene floats.\n EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. \n Richard is sitting with Sal.\n RICHARD\nThey're building a raft. It's nearly finished.\n SAL\nWhen did they get there?\n RICHARD\nI don't know. Sometime during all that shark shit.\n SAL\nWell you'll have to stop them.\n RICHARD\nThey won't get beyond the DMZ.\n SAL\nThe what?\n RICHARD\nThe demilitarized zone, Sal.\n SAL\nRight. You call it what you want, Richard, just don't let them get this \n  far.\n RICHARD\nThey won't. Believe me.\n SAL\nThis is a particularly bad time, with Christo lying in that tent, it \n  wouldn't look good if anyone arrived.\n RICHARD\nHe's still alive?\n EXT. FOREST. DAWN. \n In the small tent, a torch glows, outlining Etienne and Francoise over the \n  prone form of Christo.\nFrancoise emerges from the tent.\nRichard watches.\n EXT. FOREST. DAWN \n On the upper part of the island Richard ascends rapidly beside the \n  stream.\n EXT. HILLTOP. DAWN. \n Richard surveys the beach on the other island.\n EXT. BEACH. DAWN. \n Through binoculars.\nZeph, Sammy, and the German girls launch their raft. It floats.\nThey climb on and begin paddling.\n EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. \n Richard flits thorough the trees until he can see the shore.\n EXT. BEACH. DAY. \n The travelers on their raft come ashore.\nThey consult their map then move into the forest.\n EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. \n Richard watches them as they ascend the slope to the dope field.\nIn the other direction, hidden from the travelers perspective, he notices \n  the four farmers sitting at their shelter eating breakfast.\n EXT. FIELD. DAY. \n The travelers, watched by Richard, reach the top of the slope and then the \n  edge of the field.\nThe farmers are nearby.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nIf I was going to warn them, then now was the time to do it. All I had to \n  do was walk out and tell them not to make any noise I could lead them to \n  safety. I could persuade them to go. I could threaten them. If the worst came \n  to the worst, I could lead them to the camp and we could kick the shit out of \n  them, then send them home. But I didn't want to do any of those things. I \n  wanted to see what would happen.\nZeph, Sammy, and the German girls are jubilant.\n SAMMY\nWe are in dope heaven. There is no other explanation.\n ZEPH\n(singing)\nI smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two joints at night. I smoke two \n  joints in the afternoon and then I feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of \n  peace and two in time of war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and \n  then -\nZeph stops singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching him from a \n  few meters away.\nSammy and the others also notice, one by one. They too stand still, dumb \n  and frightened.\n ZEPH\nHi.\n SAMMY\nShit.\n ZEPH\nWe're Americans. Tourists. But we will leave. We made a mistake. We go now. \n  We take nothing.\nSlowly, he begins to walk backwards, smiling reassuringly.\nThe farmers say nothing but advance and outflank the travelers, herding \n  them back into a huddle.\n ZEPH\n(continuing)\nWe go now. We leave in peace. Look we can pay. Here, American dollars. You \n  can have them.\nThe farmers line up opposite them.\nAll begin to plead desperately for their lives.\nOne of the German girls suddenly breaks away and starts running in the \n  direction of Richard's hiding place. \nOne of the guards shoots at her repeatedly, missing.\nThe others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them down in a \n  hail of bullets.\nThe German girl keeps on running, zigzagging as she goes.\nThe farmers fire but miss.\nShe reaches the place where Richard is hiding, couched down in the \n  undergrowth.\nStartled by seeing him, she stops abruptly.\nRichard and the German girl stare into each other's eyes for a moment.\nSuddenly her chest explodes forwards as a single bullet rips through from \n  her back.\nShe falls to the ground.\nRichard is spattered in her blood.\nHe sits motionless, staring at her corpse.\n UNDERWATER. DAY.\nIn the pool at the base of the waterfall. It is empty.\nRichard appears, submerging at the speed from his jump.\nHe sinks then floats slowly towards the surface, eyes open.\n EXT. POOL. DAY. \n Richard climbs from the pool.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nSo that was it. Now I knew exactly what would happen. I wouldn't need to \n  wonder aobut it any longer.\n EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. \n Richard walks across the deserted clearing towards the light of the \n  longhouse.\nAround him, a wind begins to blow.\n INT. LOONGHOUSE. NIGHT. \n The longhouse is full. Everyone is there, apart from Etienne and Francoise, \n  engaged in quiet conversation.\nRichard is hardly noticed as he sits down.\nA few seconds later, Sal sits opposite him. She is absolutely matter of \n  fact.\n SAL\nWell?\n RICHARD\nThey're dead.\n SAL\nAll of them?\n RICHARD\nYes, all of them. They disturbed the farmers.\n SAL\nRight.\n RICHARD\nI guess that means we don't need to worry about them any more.\n SAL\nYeah. The only problem we have left is Francoise and Etienne.\nRichard realizes what she means.\n RICHARD\nYou knew they'd be killed.\n SAL\nIt's not the first time.\n RICHARD\nAnd Daffy?\n SAL\nWhat?\n RICHARD\nDaffy. He saw it happen. Didn't he? Yea, he saw it happen. And now you \n  wanted me to see it happen.\n SAL\nRichard, if you're going to live here, you've got to get involved.\nRichard's knife (the stolen one) is lying beside him. Sal picks it up by \n  the tip of the blade.\n SAL\n(continuing)\nFrancoise. And Etienne.\nShe slaps the knife into Richard's hand.\nShe stands up and walks away.\nRichard contemplates the knife.\n EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. \n A storm is building up, scattering anything loose across the \n  clearing.\n INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. \n Most of the lights are out now. The wind is beginning to rattle the \n  building.\nRichard lies awake.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI wasn't thinking about what she asked me to do.\n INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. \n Richard and Daffy shake hands.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI was trying to remember somewhere I used to call home, someone I used to \n  be, but I couldn't put a name to that place or a face to that person anymore - \n  they got left behind in a hotel room in the Khao San Road along with a man who \n  cut his wrists.\n INT. DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. \n Richard steps carefully across the floor, avoiding the pools of \n  blood.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nBut at least I understood why he'd done it.\n EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. \n It is pouring rain and the storm grows stronger.\nRichard appears alone in the clearing, the knife in his hadn.\nThunder and lightening begin.\n RICHARD (V.O.)\nI still didn't know what I was going to do when I got to them. You see, \n  when you have blood on your hands, you ask yourself, what difference will it \n  make if you spill some more? I had made a sacrifice to keep the secret, and \n  now that sacrifice was the secret.\n EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. \n Richard approaches the faint glow of the small tent where Francoise is \n  nursing christo.\nHe is carrying the knife.\nHe crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping in the open \n  doorway.\n INT. LONGHOUSE NIGHT. \n Inside there is darkness while all are sleeping.\nThe thunder is directly overhead and the lightening flashes frequently.\nSonja stirs in her sleep.\nIn a flash of lightening she thinks she sees something.\nA whole series of flashes provide a clearer view.\nAt the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy, and the two German girls, \n  hang upside down and bound together from the central beam in the roof of the \n  building.\nZeph appears to be staring at her, his hair trailing against her feet.\nShe screams.\nMore lightening illuminates the four armed Farmers.\n EXT.

Why?\n SAL\nNo, we don't. We bring no one.\n FARMER\nYou are lying! You are bringing people here. Too many people!\nHe hits her with the rifle butt.\n SAL\nNo, I promise, we keep it secret. We tell no one.\nHe hits her again.\n FARMER\nThen who drew this?\nHe holds out the map drawn by Richard.\n EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. \n Richard draws closer to Etienne.

He studies it.\n EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. \n Richard's bald is at Etienne's throat.\nHe opens his eyes, frozen with fear.\nRichard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the knife at \n  Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare \n  at each other.\nRichard takes the knife away.\n RICHARD\nYou have to leave. Do you understand? You have to leave right now. If you \n  don't they'll kill you.\n ETIENNE\nWhat about Christo?\n RICHARD\nThere is nothing more you can do. I'll look after him.\n FRANCOISE\nRichard -\n RICHARD\nYou don't have time to talk about this. You have to go now.\nChristo moans.

NIGHT. \n Richard swims out towards the cliff.\nHe reaches the cliff and pauses, taking a deep breath before submerging \n  towards the underwater tunnel.\n INT. CAVE. NIGHT. \n Moonlight reflects in through the chimney and the entrance.\nEtienne and Francoise are in the boat.\nEtienne is trying to start the boat.\nHe sees the silhouette of a man surface and crawl onto the flat rock.\nEtienne steps off the boat onto the rock as the figure in the shadows \n  approaches him.\n ETIENNE\nRichard, come one, get into the boat.\nThe man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his \n  abdomen.\n ETIENNE\n(continuing)\nRichard!\nIt is Bugs.\n BUGS\nRichard can't help you now, French boy.\nFrancoise screams.\nBugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his knees.\nBugs turns his attention to Francoise.
