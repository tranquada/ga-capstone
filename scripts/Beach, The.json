Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment.</p>\n<p>At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.</p>\n<p>A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a \"menu\" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.</p>\n<p>Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht.</p>\n<p>The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.</p>\n<p>A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard.

Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.</p>\n<p>He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor.</p>\n<p>While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.</p>\n<p>There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.</p>\n<p>Richard turns to the source of the whistle.</p>\n<p>A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</p>\n<b></b><p>FRANCOIS</p>\n<p>Et voila.</p>\n<i></i><p>The door swings gently open. She stands back</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<i></i><p>Footsteps approach from the stair.</p>\n<p>Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her.

They enter their room and the door is closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>\n<p>I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.</p>\n\n<b><ol start=\"7\">\n</ol></b><b><li>INT RESTAURANT.

On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television.</p>\n<p>Most of the tables around him are empty.</p>\n<p>Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>\n<p>Excuse me.</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>\n<p>Yes?</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>\n<p>I'm Daffy.</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>\n<p>Richard.

I promise I will repay you.</p>\n<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>\n<p>Just take it, OK.</p>\n<i></i><p>Daffy takes it.</p>\n<p>Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face.</p> \n\n<b><ol start=\"8\">\n</ol></b><b><li>INT. <b>RICHARD</b>'S HOTEL ROOM.

They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.</p>\n<p>Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other <i>direction.

He is wearing a bandana \n  which has slipped half off in his sleep.</p>\n<p>Very slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a \n  Kalashnikov-type assult rifle.</p>\n<p>Richard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>He lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight.</p>\n<p>He closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the \n  farmer's nose.</p>\n<p>In his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. \n  Richard withdraws the gun a fraction.</p>\n<p>His finger strokes the trigger.</p>\n<p>He moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each \n  sleeping farmer and mouthing \"bang\" as he goes.</p>\n<p>He returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him.</p>\n<p>The farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep \n  and wakes slightly.</p>\n<p>He reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal.

DAY. <i>\n</i></li></b> <p>A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.</p>\n<p>The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet \n  protruding from the end.</p>\n<p>Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.</p><b>\n<b> </b></b><p>KEATY (O.S.)</p>\n<p>We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't \n  claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a \n  straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard \n  for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us.</p><i>\n</i><p>Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is \n  heaped on.</p><b>\n<b> </b></b><p>KEATY</p>\n<p>He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played \n  cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I \n  think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. \n  Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you \n  soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.</p><i>\n</i><p>Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.</p>\n<p>Others throw flowers in.</p>\n<p>Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</p>\n<b> <li>INT.

You \n  see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important \n  thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone \n  makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get \n  better in which case everyone can forget about it.
