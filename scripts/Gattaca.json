A\n     wide expanse of wasteland.\n\n     Suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky\n     and crashes onto the parched ground.  The earth-shuddering\n     impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before\n     finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust.\n\n     The first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping\n     from the heavens.  It lands near the first.  Another tusk\n     smashes to earth several yards away.  Yet another comes crashing\n     into the foreground.\n\n     Finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.\n\n<b>     DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b>     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE\n</b>\n     In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks\n     suddenly rains down from the sky.  The trunks thump to the hard\n     ground, also rebounding in slow motion.  Cleanly sawn,\n     branchless, palm-like trunks, they come to rest in the dust only\n     to be followed by a second cascade of lumber.\n\n     When the dust finally clears. the felled tree trunks lie in a\n     huge, log-jam in the desert.\n\n<b>     DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b>     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE\n</b>\n     Next to descend from the sky, a torrent of firewood.  One shower\n     after another, crashing to the plain.  Enough chopped lumber to\n     fuel a thousand hearths.\n\n<b>     DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b>     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE\n</b>\n     Joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate - sheets\n     of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to\n     earth.  Some of the pieces shattering, some rebounding into the\n     air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the\n     eye can see.\n\n<b>     TITLES ARE SPACED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE PRECEDING\n</b><b>     SEQUENCE.

Gradually they are revealed as human\n     fingernails magnified many hundreds of times.\n\n     The tree trunks are mere hair follicles.  The firewood,\n     whiskers.  The slate, flakes of skin.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  INCINERATOR.  EARLY MORNING.\n</b>\n     A naked MAN, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal\n     floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his\n     skin raw with a wire brush.  JEROME MORROW.\n\n     Having completed his scrupulous ablutions, Jerome arches his\n     lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room\n     with practised ease.\n\n     Securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he\n     turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber.  The gas\n     instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming\n     modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator.\n\n     We refocus on a MAGNIFIED CLOSE UP of his exfoliated flesh in\n     the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns.\n\n     Jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of\n     backless slippers.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.\n</b>\n     JEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious\n     loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment -\n     arranged somewhat like a production line.\n\n     Long, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along\n     one entire wall.  Laid out on the benches in neat rows are\n     dozens of plastic bags - some filled, some unfilled.  Instruments\n     on trays - various types of tweezers, scissors and other less\n     familiar utensils.  Round, stainless steel containers filled\n     with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter.\n\n     JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches.\n     EUGENE.  He clutches an empty vodka bottle.  He is snoring\n     lightly - sleeping off the night before.  As JEROME gently\n     prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the\n     similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's.\n\n     Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising\n     ease.  A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design.  Jerome wheels\n     Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger\n     man onto the bed.  Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co-\n     operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight.\n\n     After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom\n     containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink,\n     shower and toilet.\n\n     Beside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stainless\n     steel refrigerator.\n\n     Donning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen\n     cooled refrigerator.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows\n     out.  Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and\n     silicon pouches - some containing a yellowish liquid, some a\n     deep, red liquid.\n\n     In front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list -\n     <i>\"TRUFFLES, CIGS, VODKA\"</i>.  Jerome smiles to himself as he\n     retrieves the note along with one of the jars.  He checks the\n     jar's label.  Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks\n     the seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of\n     an IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter.\n\n     He seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve\n     on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid\n     into the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe.  We\n     remain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and\n     inserts the pouch.\n\n     Reopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray containing\n     neat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a\n     deep, red-colored liquid.  He removes his gloves, selects one of\n     the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the\n     end of his index finger.  He prepares a second sachet for his\n     middle finger.  Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup\n     to the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers.\n     JEROME, still dressed in his robe, climbs a large, spiral\n     staircase to the floor above.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.\n</b>\n     He emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large,\n     loft-stlye condominium.  Through the floor to ceiling window\n     that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting\n     to leak into the night sky.\n\n     In the bedroom JEROME removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag.\n     Printed on the bag - <i>\"Confidentiality Guaranteed\"</i>.  He emerges\n     from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut\n     suit.  He adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb\n     the sachets attached to his fingertips.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S POOL.  MORNING.\n</b>\n     A lone MAN swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to\n     be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's\n     end.  We pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against\n     an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself.\n\n     Abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current\n     instantly stilled.  We glimpse the face of INVESTIGATOR LUCAS.\n     Thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face.  We have the\n     impression that he does not swim for pleasure.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  MORNING.\n</b>\n     It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground\n     parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds\n     down the long straight driveway.  He exchanges a wave with a\n     GARDENER trimming a lawn.\n\n     The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its\n     conventional appearance.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.\n</b>\n     JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road\n     leading to the parking lot of \"GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION\".\n     A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly\n     manicured landscaped gardens.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.\n</b>\n     JEROME strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds\n     of other GATTACA EMPLOYEES.  He carries himself with a certain\n     arrogance, a cool detachment.  All employees wear similarly\n     unconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans.\n     The Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and\n     women and a diverse range of ethnicities.\n\n     They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY\n     GUARDS.  Each channel contains a computerized security device,\n     featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger\n     under the watchful eye of a Security Guard.\n\n     Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his index\n     finger in the groove.  His fingertip is jabbed with the\n     finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken.\n\n     The blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity - an ID photograph\n     appearing on a computer screen.\n\n     Out of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman\n     entering through the adjacent channel.  She is also sneaking a\n     glance in his direction - IRENE.  Catching each other looking,\n     they both quickly avert their eyes.\n\n     As Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace\n     Corporation he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in\n     his fingertip sachet.\n\n\n<b>     SOMEWHERE IN DEEP SPACE.\n</b>\n     A GATTACA spacecraft skirts an asteroid.  Taking advantage of\n     the rock's gravitational pull, the craft slingshots deeper into\n     the black void.  Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze\n     in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward\n     again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course.\n\n     We pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly\n     realistic graphic representation on a GATTACA computer screen\n     operated by JEROME.\n\n     Appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a\n     seemingly never-ending column of computer instructions for this\n     celestial navigation - the incomprehensible language of the\n     computer programmer.\n\n              140 #x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20{\n              150 #x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00\n              160 #xfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfe\n\n     Jerome is transported - plotting a path through the heavens.\n     As his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his\n     eyes from the screen.\n\n     His is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations,\n     arranged in ever-widening circles in a huge, curcular, well-\n     appointed if antiseptic room.  Each curved desk contains a\n     computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim,\n     transparent screen behind which is seated a PROGRAMMER,\n     designing software for the aerospace agency.  At the center of\n     the room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing\n     outwards, from which operations are monitored.\n\n     Floor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only\n     concession to nature - a tinted view of a man-made, meticulously\n     landscaped garden.\n\n     Jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a\n     discreet mini-vac.  He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard.\n     DIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man\n     approaches.  His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder.\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>              You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              --Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?\n\n     The Director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc\n     on Jerome's desk.\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>              I reviewed your flight plan.  Not one error\n              in a hundred thousand keystrokes.  Phenomenal.\n                      (placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder)\n              It's right that someone like you is taking us\n              to the Belt.\n                      (glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)\n              You have a substance test.\n\n     The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow.  At a nearby work\n     station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at\n     the mention of the test.\n\n     Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his\n     ankle.  However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's\n     transparent specimen bags from his sock.  An EXTREME CLOSE UP\n     reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles,\n     eyelashes, a fingernail.  Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid\n     detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his\n     keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station.\n\n     He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of\n     the bag.  Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two\n     hair follicles.\n\n     Jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the\n     testing lab.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - TESTING LABORATORY.  DAY.\n</b>\n     White-coated LAMAR, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks\n     JEROME's eyes with an instrument.  Satisfied with his\n     examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to\n     JEROME.  Standing directly in front of the technician with his\n     back to camera, Jerome opens his fly.  A steady stream of urine\n     begins to flow into the container from Jerome's hidden pouch.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (staring admiringly at the discharge)\n              Jerome...never shy.

Why didn't my\n              folks order a cock like that for me?\n\n     LAMAR pours the urine sample into a high-tech device where it\n     is instantly analyzed.  The urine identifies Jerone while also\n     registering a negative drug reading.  The computer reads\n     <i>\"VALID\"</i>.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (walking Jerome to the door)\n              If everything goes to plan, this could be the\n              last time I see you for a while.

He inserts two replacement lenses from\n     the container and reattaches it in its hiding place.\n     Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  He checks in the\n     mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.\n</b>\n     Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors,\n     JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex -\n     or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  The incessant tapping\n     of computer keys has stilled.\n\n     As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the\n     reflection of his face, deep in thought.\n\n                           <i>JEROME (VO)\n              The most unremarkable of events.

VINCENT, realizing\n     Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support.\n     Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him\n     back to shore.  Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the\n     shallows.  They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted,\n     gasping for air.  ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene.

MORNING.\n</b>\n     DETECTIVE HUGO, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit\n     and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon\n     or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood-\n     spattered computer keyboard alongside the Director's shattered\n     skull.  The indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard.\n     Hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and\n     seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic\n     bag.\n\n     A CREW of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically\n     vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial-\n     looking mini-vacs.  Once each work space has been vacuumed, the\n     transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled.\n\n     OTHER DETECTIVES video the scene with camcorders.

We focus on JEROME.\n     Standing slightly apart from the others, he does not appear to\n     share the joke, or perhaps even hear it.  Jerome watches, wide-\n     eyed, as a DETECTIVE approaches his work station with a mini-\n     vac.  A chill goes through Jerome as the detective's cleaner\n     passes over his desk.\n\n     Jerome is distracted by a smear on the window, obstructing his\n     view.  Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the\n     smear away with his elbow.  Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR\n     notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's\n     eyes.  DIRECTOR JOSEF suddenly appears at Jerome's shoulder.\n     Standing a pace behind the Director, computer notepad in hand,\n     is IRENE.\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>              You're lucky to be getting out of this.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              We're still going ahead as planned?\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>              The launch window is only open until week's\n              end.

Suddenly\n     there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up.

Trying to act casually, she looks under the papers\n     on his desk, then opens the top desk drawer.\n\n     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the comb lying there - the two\n     hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb.

Once they're up, we\n              can hardly turn the boat around.\n\n     On the treadmill below, Jerome glances to his watch as he runs,\n     the distress starting to show.  Caught up in the conversation,\n     Lamar has forgotten to end the work-out.  Remembering, he\n     finally presses the \"WARM-DOWN\" button, slowing the treadmill.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (still marveling at Jerome)\n              I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd\n              still be there.\n\n     We focus on Jerome's recording device attached to the bottom of\n     the control panel.  It clicks to a stop, indicating that the\n     bogus heartbeat recording has ended before the workout.\n\n     The heartbeat monitor in the observation room suddenly races\n     from 80 to 250 beats per minute.  Lamar catches the discrepancy\n     out of the corner of his eye but before he can take a second\n     look, Jerome has whipped his electrode from his chest.  The\n     physician shrugs it off as a glitch in the machine.\n\n     The Investigator has turned his back on Jerome to face the\n     Director.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>              We believe we have a suspect.\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>              What a relief.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>                      (referring to the profile of VINCENT\n                      on Hugo's computer notepad)\n              This unaccountable specimen was found in\n              the south wing corridor.\n\n     In the room below, Jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill,\n     stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the\n     control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack.\n\n     He casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a\n     towel, briefly glances to Irene with the Investigators and exits\n     to the locker room.\n\n     The Director idly regards the image of VINCENT on Hugo's\n     handheld screen.  He does not recognize the face.\n\n<b>                           DETECTIVE HUGO\n</b>              An age enhancement is being prepared as\n              we speak.\n\n<b>                           DIRECTOR JOSEF\n</b>                      (referring to his assistant)\n              Irene will make it available to security.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  GATTACA - LOCKER ROOM.  DAY.\n</b>\n     JEROME wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor\n     and into the now empty locker room.  He exchanges a cheery\n     greeting with an exiting COLLEAGUE, enters a shower stall,\n     closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower\n     stall floor.\n\n     The effects of the gruelling work-out are only now apparent.  No\n     longer sucking up the pain, he gulps air into his oxygen-starved\n     lungs, his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest.\n     He writhes in agony on the white-tiled floor - a brutal reminder\n     of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

LUNCHTIME.\n</b>\n     In Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and\n     recovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one\n     of the umbrella-covered tables.  While most of the others pick\n     at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,\n     Jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.\n\n     The sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from\n     his colleagues.  Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by\n     liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.\n\n     However when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye\n     contact.  When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -\n     thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby\n     trashcan.  A janitor reaches for the napkin.  It is the Old\n     Janitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life.\n\n<b>                           CAESAR\n</b>              I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.\n\n     The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

However the blades of the turbines are motionless in\n     the still afternoon.  JEROME finally catches up with IRENE.  She\n     turns, unsurprised by his appearance.  Standing beside her, he\n     looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (eyes fixed on the view)\n              We were looking at each other.

NIGHT.\n</b>\n     JEROME and IRENE step over feet, apologizing as they go,\n     eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold-out concert\n     hall.\n\n     On the stage below, a YOUNG PIANIST - a teenage prodigy - has\n     already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano.  The\n     pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play - an\n     extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard\n     before.  IRENE looks to JEROME.  He is clearly caught up in the\n     music.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     The music from the piano recital continues under the following\n     contrasting action.  A huge, brooding housing project.  PEOPLE\n     hang around on street corners.  Menace in the air - a feeling of\n     impending violence.\n\n     Suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions,\n     blocking any escape route.  Dozens of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES\n     pour out of the cars and onto the street.\n\n     People scatter, many running straight into the arms of the\n     Detectives.  OTHERS, spilling out of the housing project, are\n     also immediately apprehended.\n\n     The Detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting\n     Jerome's description - WOMEN, OLD MEN and TEENAGERS.  They are\n     shepherded off the street.  A line of IN-VALIDS is formed\n     several hundred yards long.  Detectives begin to laboriously\n     move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each\n     suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable\n     analyzers worn on their hips.\n\n     As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN\n     suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will\n     incriminate them.  Other Detectives, watching for such escape\n     attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting\n     police van.\n\n     With the raid under control, DETECTIVE HUGO indicates to the\n     INVESTIGATOR that it is safe to exit his car.  The Investigator\n     appears irritated, only half-glancing at the TWO MEN already in\n     custody, apparently certain that neither one is his suspect.\n\n<b>                           DETECTIVE HUGO\n</b>                      (enthusiastic)\n              Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.\n\n     The Investigator clearly does not share Hugo's enthusiasm.  The\n     Detective offers the Investigator an age enhanced photograph,\n     computer-generated from the last existing photo of VINCENT as\n     a 20-year-old.\n\n<b>                           DETECTIVE HUGO\n</b>              This is the age enhancement we're working with.\n\n     The Investigator ignores the photo, preferring instead to trust\n     his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects.\n\n<b>                           DETECTIVE HUGO\n</b>                      (referring to the line-up)\n              As you requested, we've kept the parameters\n              wider than usual.\n\n     The MEN they scrutinize are hardly mutants - the differences\n     between an IN-VALID and a DAN are subtle at best.  Some shorter,\n     some wearing glasses, some with receding hairlines or bald, many\n     with no discernable physical difference at all.  The\n     Investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and\n     starts walking back to his car.\n\n     The mystified Detective Hugo follows his superior.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>              We're in the wrong place.

The YOUNG PIANIST on the stage bows deeply,\n     soaking up the applause of the AUDIENCE.  The pianist tosses one\n     of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an\n     adoring FAN.  The second glove he tosses up to the box where\n     JEROME and IRENE are standing.  Jerome snares the glove out of\n     the air and immediately hands it to Irene.  She promptly slips\n     the glove on her own hand.\n\n     The glove fits snugly over her five fingers.  However one finger\n     of the glove remains unfilled.  Jerome is stunned to realize\n     that it is a six-fingered glove.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (catching his look of astonishment)\n              You didn't know?\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (trying hard to convince)\n              Yes...<i>yes</i>...\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (picking up a resentment, confused)\n              You're angry--\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              Why would I be angry?

IRENE'S CAR.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     IRENE drives, JEROME at her side.  Cars are being flagged down\n     by uniformed POLICE OFFICERS.  Irene slows down behind the car\n     in front.  Spying an OFFICER shine a flashlight in the eyes of\n     the MALE DRIVER up ahead, Jerome wipes the contact lenses from\n     his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when Irene\n     is not looking.\n\n     An OFFICER approaches Jerome and, without a word, opens an\n     electronic testing kit worn on his hip.  He removes a sterilized\n     Q-tip and motions for Jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape\n     a culture.  Jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth,\n     feigning embarrassment.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (conspiratorial)\n              Better not.\n                      (nodding in Irene's direction)\n              Don't want to give you a contaminated\n              specimen...if you get my meaning.\n\n     IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop.\n\n     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively\n     retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff.  With the\n     hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from\n     his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment.\n\n     The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle\n     and places it in a receptacle in his kit.  After a short moment\n     the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's\n     electronic screen.  As the cop departs, Irene looks\n     questioningly at Jerome.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              Thanks.\n                      (answering her unasked question)\n              You never know where those swabs have been.\n\n     Irene nods, however clearly not convinced.

We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV.\n     Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     After closing time, suited DETECTIVES vacuum the club in which\n     Jerome and Eugene dined the previous evening.  MICHAEL, the\n     owner, looks on disdainfully.  Waiting in the background, the\n     regular CLEANERS - most likely In-valids themselves - smirk to\n     each other, enjoying watching the cops do their work for them.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  OCEAN HIGHWAY.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     With no place to turn the car around, IRENE parks on the cliff\n     side of the six-lane highway.  In the darkness she dashes from\n     the car and, without a second thought, runs directly out into\n     the heavy commuter traffic.  Easily negotiating the on-coming\n     cars, she emerges safely on the other side of the highway.\n\n     JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to\n     follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb.  We focus\n     on his eyes, deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses.\n     From Jerome's POV, we see that the headlights rushing towards\n     him are nothing but a series of fast-moving blurs - blurs that\n     merge together.  He is unable to distinguish between the\n     vehicles or judge their distance.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (calling back urgently from the\n                      other side, mindful of the light\n                      beginning to leak into the sky)\n              Come on!

Jerome puts a foot off the curb at\n     the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car.\n     Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming.  Does she detect a squint\n     on Jerome's face?  To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other\n     side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels\n     her expectation.  He touches the spectacles, still in his\n     pocket, but they are an unthinkable option.\n\n     He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly-\n     flowing highway.  He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself\n     to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb.  Hardly even\n     glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the\n     road.  Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously\n     brushing past his heels, horns blaring.  Jerome makes a final\n     leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large,\n     fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk.\n\n     Irene is stunned by the near miss.  She is about to comment but\n     Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              Come on.  We'll miss it.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

He carefully gathers his pillow from the\n     bed and shakes it out of the window.\n\n     Slowly Jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor.  In the moonlight\n     we see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a single hair lying on the\n     floorboards.  Jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to\n     identify it in the dim light.

He prises out the \"ESC\" key from Jerome's keyboard,\n     places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (picking up a phone)\n              I'll call and let him know.\n\n     The Investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from\n     Irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>              Let's not spoil the surprise.\n                      (to Irene)\n              I understand you can show us the way.\n\n     The anxious Director Josef calls out to protest one further\n     time but the Investigator is on his way out of the door.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

With only the\n     merest hesitation she takes her cue from Eugene and kisses\n     him affectionately on the forehead.  She perches herself on the\n     arm of the sofa.

Maybe they can find out what I've got.\n\n     Under the Investigator's watchful eye, Detective Hugo withdraws\n     the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood\n     into the portable analyzer he wears.  Naturally, it confirms\n     that Eugene is Jerome.\n\n     Irene does her best to conceal her shock.  Hiding his\n     frustration, the Investigator distractedly tours the room while\n     Hugo packs up his gear.  The Investigator idly toys with\n     the telescope pointed out of the window.\n\n     Next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>              Mind if I take a leak?\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>              As long as you don't do it in my closet.\n                      (nodding to the other side of the room)\n              Over there.\n\n\n<b>     INT.

They are both spotless.  The shower stall is also\n     scrupulously clean.  He flushes the toilet and exits.\n\n     Lost in thought, the INVESTIGATOR approaches the closet again\n     and wheels out Jerome's upright vacuum cleaner.  He is\n     disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside.  The\n     Investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and\n     produces a mini-vac from Detective Hugo's crime bag.\n\n<b>                           INVESTIGATOR\n</b>                      (to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)\n              May I?\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>              Clean the whole house if you want.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (taking Eugene's lead)\n              Actually, the kitchen needs doing.\n\n     The Investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen\n     from the floor, then promptly kills the machine.  Looking down,\n     the Investigator notices the trail of Eugene's perspiration\n     on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase.\n\n     Eugene, reading the Investigator's mind, goes to call out but\n     the words remain frozen on his tongue.  Hugo follows his\n     superior as they start to descend the stairs.  Irene and Eugene\n     are left staring at one another.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  CONDO - STAIRCASE.

IRENE'S CAR OUTSIDE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     IRENE, sitting in her car outside Jerome's condominium, hangs up\n     her portable phone.  In her agitation, her finger involuntarily\n     goes to her pulse.  She catches herself and removes the finger\n     from her wrist as if it has burned her.  She exits the car.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM/EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     IRENE quietly knocks on Jerome's door but there is no response.\n     Trying the handle, the door opens.

With wonder and\n     reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on\n     Eugene's work benches.  She opens the refrigerator in the\n     bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets.

BEACH.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     JEROME and ANTON walk down a dune together towards the beach not\n     far from Gattaca - an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black\n     sea.  Jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end\n     of his thumb.  A drop of blood oozes out.  He offers the shell\n     to Anton but Anton does not take it.\n\n     Both men begin to disrobe.  The brothers stand beside each other\n     on the sand once again - Anton still the more athletically-built\n     of the two.\n\n     Together, they enter the raging surf.  Diving through the\n     breaking waves, they begin to swim.\n\n     In the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by\n     side.  They swim a long distance, Anton waiting for his brother\n     to tire.  But the pace does not slacken.  Anton pulls up in the\n     water.  Sensing his brother is no longer beside him, Jerome also\n     pulls up.  They tread water several yards apart.\n\n<b>                           ANTON\n</b>                      (attempting to conceal his distress)\n              How are you doing this, Vincent?

Anton is forced to follow\n     once again.  Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls\n     upon the same determination we have witnessed during his\n     constant swimming in the pool.  He puts on a spurt, slowly\n     reeling in Jerome.\n\n     Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort\n     will demoralize his older brother.  But Jerome has been foxing -\n     waiting for him to catch up.  Jerome smiles at Anton.  With\n     almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again.  Anton is\n     forced to go with him.  They swim again for a long distance.\n\n     It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes\n     weaken, his will draining away.  Anton pulls up, exhausted and\n     fearful.  Jerome also pulls up.  However his face displays none\n     of Anton's anxiety.\n\n     They tread water several yards apart.  The ocean is choppier\n     now.  The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the\n     peaks of the waves.\n\n<b>                           ANTON\n</b>                      (panic starting to show)\n              Vincent, where's the shore?

The two men face each other in\n     silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling\n     ocean.\n\n     Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore.  Anton is left\n     alone with the terrifying realization.  The only sound, the wind\n     and the water.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM.

They stand several yards apart.\n     Looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak.  Jerome\n     abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)\n              Here, take it.\n\n     Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (echoing Irene's words from\n                      their first encounter)\n              If you're still interested, let me know.\n\n     Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then\n     deliberately lets it fall to the ground.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>                      (never taking her eyes from him, echoing\n                      Jerome's words from their first encounter)\n              Sorry, the wind caught it.\n\n     Once again there is not a breath of wind.  The hair lies,\n     plainly visible on the edge of the pool.\n\n     From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.

For\n     once Jerome is able to sleep unconcerned.  It is Irene who lies\n     awake, head against JEROME'S chest, listening to the sound of\n     his erratically beating heart.  However it has a soothing\n     effect on her.\n\n     She kisses Jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (awakening)\n              A year is a long time.\n\n<b>                           IRENE\n</b>              Not so long--just once around the sun.\n\n     Jerome smiles.

The\n     water vapor billows out.  Jerome regards Eugene.\n\n     Eugene leads Jerome inside for the first time.\n\n     Inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators.\n     They contain thousands of blood and urine specimens.\n\n     Jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>              Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.\n\n     EUGENE points out an extra specimen of semen in the first\n     refrigerator.\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>              There's an extra specimen.  I wish I\n              could give it to her myself.\n                      (afterthought)\n              But then, you always were better at being me.\n\n     Eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (struggling to come to terms\n                      with the discovery)\n              Why have you done this?\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>                      (as he seals the mirrored door)\n              In case you get back before I do.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              Where are you going?\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>                      (glancing to the suitcases)\n              I'm travelling too.\n\n     Jerome goes to question Eugene's travel plans but thinks better\n     of it.  He kneels before his friend and embraces him.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              Thank you.\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>              I got the better end of the deal.  I just\n              lent you my body--you lent me your dream.\n\n     Jerome smiles and hugs Eugene a final time.  Eugene stuffs an\n     envelope into Jerome's pocket.\n\n<b>                           EUGENE\n</b>                      (referring to the note,\n                      glancing heavenwards)\n              Not until you're upstairs.\n\n     Jerome exits.  Eugene watches him go.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  GATTACA - DEPARTURE LOUNGE.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     JEROME enters a large holding area along with his other eleven\n<b>     CREW MEMBERS.\n</b>\n     Jerome's heart sinks as he recognizes LAMAR, greeting the crew\n     for one final unexpected substance test.  His colleagues\n     groan good-naturedly but it is clearly far more than an\n     inconvenience to Jerome.  He looks towards the door he has just\n     entered but there is no way back.  One by one the crew are\n     ushered behind a screen.  Before he can think of a way out, it\n     is Jerome's turn.  He enters the cubicle.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar)\n              What's this, Lamar?\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>              New policy.\n\n     From behind, we see Jerome unzip his fly.  However for once\n     Jerome does not urinate on cue - unused to operating his own\n     equipment in front of the physician.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (intrigued by the\n                      out-of-character discharge)\n              Flight got you nervous?\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>              There's a problem, Lamar.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (apparently not listening)\n              Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's\n              a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.\n\n     Jerome realizes he has no choice.  Resigned to his fate, he\n     begins to fill the cup.\n\n<b>                           JEROME\n</b>                      (as he urinates)\n              Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up\n              and back and nobody would have been the wiser--\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (cutting him off)\n              --Unfortunately my son's not all that they\n              promised.  But then, who know what he could do.\n\n     Lamar takes the cup from Jerome in his gloved hand.  Jerome\n     anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer.\n\n     Confirming Jerome's worst fears, the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT\n     appears on the computer screen.  However Lamar does not look at\n     the screen.  He stares Jerome in the eye.\n\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>              For future reference--\n                      (a brief glance to where\n                      Jerome has just zipped his fly)\n              --righthanded men don't hold it with their\n              left.  It's just one of those things.\n\n     Never lookig at the screen, Lamar presses a button marked,\n<b>     \"VALID\".\n</b>\n<b>                           LAMAR\n</b>                      (knowing smile)\n              Have a safe trip, Vincent.\n\n     Jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator, realizing that Lamar\n     has known all along.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     EUGENE knocks back a vodka.  With a certain reverence he places\n     his silver medal around his neck.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  ESCALATOR.

NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Inside the incinerator another ball of fire - this time\n     engulfing the unseen figure of EUGENE.  We glimpse the medal\n     around his neck, melting in the fierce blaze.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  GATTACA - LAUNCHPAD.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     As we have seen so often in the past, a rocket launches into\n     the sky over Gattaca - however on this occasion it carries\n     Jerome.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  SPACECRAFT.  NIGHT.\n</b>\n     We focus on JEROME's face - seeing little if any of the craft.\n     Jerome's eyes are closed.  His head is still - alarmingly still.\n     Could the launch itself have been too much for him?  He hear the\n     thoguhts in his head.\n\n                           <i>JEROME (VO)\n              We came from the stars so they say, now\n              it's time to go back.

He holds the letter from Eugene in\n     his hand.  It contains no words, merely a lock of EUGENE'S hair\n     - for once preserved solely for its sentimental value.  The\n     hair, weightless, floats off the page.\n\n     We focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape.\n\n\n<b>     A STARSCAPE\n</b>\n     As we pan across the constellations, a title is superimposed\n     upon the starscape:\n\n              <i>In a few short years, scientists will\n              have completed the Human Genome Project,\n              the mapping of all the genes that make\n              up a human being.\n\n              After 4 billion years of evolution by the\n              slow and clumsy method of natural selection,\n              we have now evolved to the point where we\n              can direct our own evolution.</i>\n\n     The first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title.\n\n              <i>If only we had aquired this knowledge\n              sooner, the following people would never\n              have been born:</i>\n\n     A succession of portraits and photographs of RENOWNED and\n     HISTORIC FIGURES fades in and out of the constellations - the\n     accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their\n     accomplishments.\n\n<b>                               HOMER\n</b>                         <i>Blind from birth</i>\n\n<b>                         NAPOLEON BONAPARTE\n</b>                              <i>Epileptic</i>\n\n<b>                               COLETTE\n</b>                              <i>Arthritic</i>\n\n<b>                              LOU GERHIG\n</b>                      <i>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</i>\n                         <i>(Lou Gerhig's Disease)</i>\n\n<b>                             RITA HAYWORTH\n</b>                         <i>Alzheimer's Disease</i>\n\n<b>                             HELEN KELLER\n</b>                            <i>Blind and deaf</i>\n\n<b>                           STEPHEN HAWKING\n</b>                        <i>Lou Gerhig's Disease</i>\n\n<b>                         JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE\n</b>                             <i>Asthmatic</i>\n\n<b>                           CHARLES DARWIN\n</b>                          <i>Chronic invalid</i>\n\n     The face of Charles Darwin fades off and another title appears\n     out of the stars.\n\n              <i>Even Charles Darwin, the man who told of\n              the survival of the fittest, numbered\n              amongst our frailest.</i>\n\n     The title fades off and is replaced by one final title in the\n     night sky.\n\n              <i>Of course, the other birth that would\n              surely never have taken place is your own.</i>\n\n\n<b>     CUT TO BLACK\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n     </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Gattaca</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Andrew Niccol\" title=\"Scripts by Andrew Niccol\">Andrew Niccol</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Gattaca Script.html#comments\" title=\"Gattaca comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:07.810622"}
