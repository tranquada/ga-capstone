Walter doesn't\n          react, punches out, and exits the door.\n          \n          Vicki, a tough-looking but striking woman, stands in line a\n          little further back watching.\n          \n          \n          EXT./INT.

Walter stands\n          at a bus stop across the street.\n          \n          As Vicki walks across the lot, a car pulls up next to her and\n          men catcall and whistle out the window.\n          \n          Vicki flicks them off. The men burst into hysterics and peal\n          out of the lot. She gets in her Jeep and leaves, tearing by\n          the bus stop.\n          \n           Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the\n          chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black\n          silhouettes against the darkening sky.\n          \n          Walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the\n          wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a\n          young girl striking a seductive pose.\n          \n          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY\n          \n          CLOSE on a police file. A mug shot reveals Walter, many years\n          younger.

Words stand out --\n          \"Convicted, 1st degree --,\" \"3 counts --,\" \"served --.\"\n          \n          A plain clothes officer closes the folder and looks out his\n          office window where Walter stands being fingerprinted. This\n          is Sergeant LUCAS, mid-fifties, face creased and greying\n          hair.\n          \n          \n                                                                    4.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

There is no sign of Walter.\n          \n          She sees the journal scattered on the floor and leafs through\n          the pieces.

She opens the can, grabs the bag,\n          quickly looks around the apartment. There is the sound of the\n          school bell outside. She rushes to the window and raises the\n          blinds.
