HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nA full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning\nagainst the dining room doorway.  She gazes into the camera\nwith a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the\nscreen.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            God, she's beautiful.\n\nLee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway\nand walks away.  The camera follows her, moving across a\nbook-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from\nview as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.\nPeople, some holding drinks, some just entering the\napartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once,\ncarrying on easy, familiar conversation.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            She's got the prettiest eyes, and\n            she looks so sexy in that sweater.\n\nLee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.\n\n                         LEE\n            Hi, how are you?\n\nTwo more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full\nnow.  Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as\nshe continues on her way towards the living room.  Elliot's\nvoice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            I just want to be alone with her\n            and hold her and kiss her...\n\nLee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a\nmoment to talk to the child she has just hugged.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            ...and tell her how much I love her\n            and take care of her.  Stop it, you\n            idiot.  She's your wife's sister.\n            But I can't help it.\n\nThe camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops\nto chat with her mother.  Elliot's voice, as well as the\nmusic, continues over the low din of warm conversation.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            I'm consumed by her.  It's been\n            months now.  I dream about her.  I-\n            I, I think about her at the office.\n            Oh, Lee.\n                   (sighing)\n            What am I gonna do?\n\nLee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation\nwith her mother.  She passes several other guests, then\nturns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            I hear myself mooning over you, and\n            it's disgusting.  Before, when she...\n\nElliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen,\nstanding in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing,\nrotund man.  Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray\nof hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them.  The\nspace is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make\nroom for her.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            ...squeezed past me in the doorway,\n            and I smelled that perfume on the\n            back of her neck...\n\nElliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious,\ncontinues to talk.  Elliot reluctantly returns to the\nconversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at\nthe offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            ...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna\n            swoon!  Easy...\n\nThe camera resumes following a smiling Lee.  She has just\nput down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and\nobliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still\nruminating, watches her, entranced.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            You're a dignified financial\n            advisor.  It doesn't look good for\n            you to swoon.\n\nThe camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the\noffscreen Lee.  In the background, guests continue to\nchatter warmly with each other.\n\nHannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind\nthe distracted Elliot.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)\n            Elliot?

These are\n            wonderful.\n                   (nibbling, swallowing)\n            Holly and her friend made them.\n\nElliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as\nwell as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the\nliving room.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (swallowing)\n            They're fantastic.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (overlapping, still eating)\n            Aren't they great?\n\n                         ELLIOT\n            Your sister is an unbelievable cook.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (swallowing)\n            I know!  I know!\n\nElliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway\nand offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway.\nShe holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands\nat the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the\noffscreen guests.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (walking offscreen)\n            She has all the cooking talent.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (walking offscreen swallowing)\n            No, she doesn't, either.

HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nHannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered\nrefrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to\nspeak.  The faint sounds of music are still heard.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Hannah, I have to borrow some more\n            money.\n                   (sipping her drink)\n            Don't get upset.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (stirring some food\n                   in a saucepan on the stove)\n            Mmm, I never get upset over that.\n            Mmm?\n\n                         HOLLY\n            This is the last time, I promise.\n            And I'm keeping strict accounts.\n\nAs Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in\nthe kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked\nwith bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and\ngeneral party clutter.  She walks on-and-offscreen as she\ntalks and listens to her sister.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            Holly, please.  Don't insult me.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (putting her empty\n                   glass and plate down\n                   on the table)\n            Someday, I'll pay it all back.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            I know.  H-how much do you need?\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Two thousand dollars.\n\nHannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby\ncounter, hesitates momentarily.  She turns to Holly.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (trying to nod her\n                   head casually)\n            Uh-huh.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (gesturing, her back\n                   to the camera)\n            Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my\n            friend April and I, we have this\n            catering idea I think's going to be\n            great.\n\nHannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (turning to face Hannah)\n            You admit that we're great cooks,\n            right?\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (nodding, back at the\n                   stove now, stirring\n                   in a pot)\n            Yeah.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (putting her hands in\n                   her pockets)\n            Well, in order to get started,\n            there's just a few things I have to\n            buy...\n                   (gesturing)\n            and some old debts I have\n            outstanding.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (looking at her sister)\n            Will you just tell me one thing?\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (nodding)\n            Okay.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            Are we talking about cocaine again?\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (shaking her head no)\n            I swear.  I swear.  We've already\n            got some requests to do a few\n            dinner parties.\n\nA timer goes off.  Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some\nfood on a different stove.  Holly turns to face her.  Only\nHolly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the\ncamera moving in closer on her face.  As Holly speaks, she\ndistractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre.  In the background,\nher parents can be heard singing in the living room.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            I mean, obviously, I'm not going to\n            be a caterer forever, you know.  We\n            both still go to auditions.\n            Something could turn up at any\n            moment.  But the parties are at\n            night, days are free, I can still\n            take my acting class.  I haven't\n            done drugs on a year.\n\nHolly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the\nbackground singing gets louder and the film cuts to:\n\nINT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe living room is crowded with family and guests sitting\ncomfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's\nfather, plays \"Bewitched\" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits\nnearby, accompanying him in their duet.  A child is sprawled\nout under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly;\nothers drink and eat, listening.\n\n                         EVAN & NORMA\n                   (singing)\n            \"A whimpering, simpering\n            Child again\n            Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered\n            Am I...\"\n\nAs they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen,\nwhere Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway.\n\n                         LEE\n            Mom and Dad are floating down\n            memory lane again!\n\nLee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a\ncounter.  Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe.\nHolly, leaning on the table, sips her drink.  The music from\nthe living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat\ncomfortably and easily with each other.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (smiling and turning\n                   to Lee)\n            Aah...

Once again Holly's in the backseat.\nThe classical music begins anew.\n\nThe movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a\nManhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar.  It then\nmoves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her\nhead near the window.  She is staring straight ahead.\n\n                         HOLLY (V.O.)\n            Naturally I get taken home first.\n            Well, obviously he prefers April.\n            Of course I was so tongue-tied all\n            night.  I can't believe I said that\n            about the Guggenheim.  My stupid\n            little roller-skating joke.  I\n            should never tell jokes.  Mom can\n            tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.\n                   (glaring at the\n                   offscreen April's back)\n            Where did April come up with that\n            stuff about Adolph Loos and terms\n            like \"organic form\"?\n                   (looking out the side\n                   window, pausing for a moment)\n            Well, naturally.  She went to\n            Brandeis.\n\nThe movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat\nwhere David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the\npassing lights and traffic of the street.  Holly continues\nher ruminations as April leans over to say something to David.\n\n                         HOLLY (V.O.)\n            But I don't think she knows what\n            she's talking about.  Could you\n            believe the way she was calling him\n            David? \"Yes, David.  I feel that\n            way, too, David.  What a marvelous\n            space, David.\"\n                   (emphatically)\n            I hate April.  She's pushy.\n\nThe film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in\nthought.\n\n                         HOLLY (V.O.)\n            Now they'll dump me and she'll\n            invite him up.  I blew it.\n                   (sighing, looking out\n                   the side window)\n            And I really like him a lot.  Oh,\n            screw it.  I'm not gonna get all\n            upset.  I've got reading to do\n            tonight.  You know, maybe I'll get\n            into bed early.  I'll turn to a\n            movie and take an extra Seconal.\n\nThe classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins.  The\nscreen cuts to black and a title appears.\n\n    \"...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.\"\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - DAY\n\nThe movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered\ndoor as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby.  He\nlooks down the street and the film cuts to his point of\nview: Frederick's loft building.\n\nThe movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking\naround him.  He glances at his watch as the film cuts back\nonce again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears,\nwalking down the street away from Elliot.  A truck passes\ndown the street.  Lee doesn't see him.  She walks further\nand further away; she turns a corner.\n\nElliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of\ndecision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the\nstreet, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street,\npast The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings,\nas the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different\nstreet, oblivious.\n\nThe jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between\nthe fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past\na truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians,\nsome garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee,\nwalking up different streets, past different buildings.\n\nLee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking\nright and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on\nthe corner, looking at his watch.  She looks up in surprise;\nthe music stops.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (trying not to sound\n                   out of breath)\n            Oh, my goodness!\n\n                         LEE\n                   (overlapping, smiling\n                   in surprise)\n            Oh, Elliot!\n\n                         ELLIOT\n            Hi.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (smiling)\n            What are you doing here?\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (looking around, gesturing)\n            Well, I'm-I'm looking for a\n            bookstore.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (shaking her head)\n            Oh, what, in this section of town?\n\n                         ELLIOT\n            Yes.

METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nManon Lescaut is being performed.  Onstage, the soprano in\nthe title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the\nruins of a wagon.  The background is dark.  The film moves\nup to the private boxes in the upper loge.  David and Holly\ncan be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes.\nDavid glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine.\nThe movie briefly cuts back to the stage.  The soprano is\nleaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars.  Then it's back\nto a closer look at Holly and David in their box.  The aria\ncontinues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass.  He\nuncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses.\nHolly mouths a thank you, glancing around.  They look at\neach other and raise their glasses in a toast.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\n        Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton.\n\nThe opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and\nsounding their \"Bravos.\"\n\nThe clapping stops as the movie cuts to Frederick's loft.\nIt is day.  Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has\nopened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star\nDusty Frye.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (leading the way into\n                   the loft, gesturing)\n            Lee, Frederick...say hello to Dusty\n            Frye.\n\nLee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (shaking Dusty's hand)\n            Hi, Dusty.\n\n                         DUSTY\n            Hi.\n\nLee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses,\na red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat.

Elliot quickly turns away from Lee.\nShe tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft\nentranceway.  Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a\nconfused Dusty.

The piano music continues in the\nbackground as the movie cuts to:\n\nLee walking along a wharf by the waterfront.  The wind blows\nher hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest.\nShe, too, is deep in thought.

A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped\nprone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module.\nAs the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under\nthe scan, two technicians can be seen through the window\nseparating the scanner from the control room.  One of them,\nsitting down, taps information into a computer while the\nother technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the\ncomputer screen.\n\nThe movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing\nan image of Mickey's skull.  Scan lines bleep over the skull.\nThe camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once\nagain, as seen through the window, silent and serious under\nthe CAT-scan module.\n\nFrom Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two\ntechnicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room.\nThey examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to\neach other.  One of the men, nodding, taps more information\ninto the computer.\n\nWhile they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts\nto a back view of Mickey under the module.  There is a\nscience-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in\nthe center of a huge, white, futuristic circle.  The\nstretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT. DR.

Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking\nthe kiss.  They embrace.  They kiss each other lightly, then\nstronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter.\n\nAnd it's later that night.  The harpsichord music begins to\nplay again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal\nLee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out\non the pillows, one arm near her head.\n\n                         LEE\n            That was just perfect.

STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT\n\nLee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded.\nThe streets are dark.  A car drives by; a pedestrian passes\nholding an umbrella.  Lee passes a restaurant well lit\ninside by hanging lamps.  The baroque music continues as she\nenters the loft, her head soaked.

She passes Frederick, who sits\nat a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and\nreading the paper.  A plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits\nin front of him.  The music stops.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (opening the bathroom door)\n            Lucy and I kept talking, and I\n            didn't realize how late it had\n            gotten.\n\n                         FREDERICK\n                   (barely glancing up\n                   from his paper)\n            You missed a very dull TV show\n            about Auschwitz.

HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nHannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book\npropped up on her knees.  A cupboard with some bric-a-brac\nis mounted behind the night table, which holds a small,\nwhite, warm-glowing lamp and some photographs.  She turns\nthe page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters.\nShe continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge\nof the bed and muses.  His voice is heard over the screen.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            What passion today with Lee.  She's\n            a volcano.  It was a totally\n            fulfilling experience... Just as I\n            dreamed it would be.\n                   (nodding slightly as\n                   he takes off his slippers)\n            That's what it was.  It was like\n            living out a dream...a great dream.\n                   (taking off his bathrobe)\n            Now I feel very good and cozy being\n            here next to Hannah.  There's\n            something very lovely and real\n            about Hannah.\n                   (tossing his bathrobe\n                   aside and lying down\n                   on the bed next to\n                   Hannah, his hands\n                   crossed over his stomach)\n            She gives me a very deep feeling of\n            being part of something.  She's a\n            wonderful woman...and I betrayed\n            her.  She came into my empty life\n            and changed it...and I paid her\n            back by banging her sister in a\n            hotel room.  God, I'm despicable.\n            What a cruel and shallow thing to\n            do.\n                   (sitting up)\n            I have to call her now and tell her\n            what we did was crazy.\n                   (anxiously)\n            It can't ever happen again.  I'm\n            not that kind of man...and I value\n            Hannah too much.  I love my wife.\n            Now I've betrayed her.  Oh, God!\n\nElliot frantically stands up and leaves the room.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (reading, not looking up)\n            Where're you going?\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (offscreen)\n            I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a\n            phone number in my desk.

I-I can't believe I\n            forgot.\n\nElliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (muttering)\n            What if he answers?\n                   (turning into the\n                   doorway leading to\n                   the living room)\n            I'll hang up.\n                   (walking into the\n                   darkened living room)\n            I'll tell her we can't communicate\n            until I terminate my marriage.\n                   (whispering)\n            It's immoral.\n\nElliot switches on the light.  He paces back and forth in\nfront of the piano and an accompanying music stand.  The top\nof the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he\nturned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and\nthe piece of sheet music open on the piano.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (gesturing and whispering)\n            Then, time will pass.  I won't\n            call, and she'll get the idea.  I\n            gotta stop this before I get in too\n            deep.  I'd rather hurt Lee a\n            little, than destroy Hannah.\n\nElliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (whispering, rubbing\n                   his hands)\n            It's one-thirty.  She...she can't\n            have a conversation with me...with\n            him around.  I'm getting hysterical.\n                   (putting his hands on\n                   his hips)\n            I'll call her first thing in the\n            morning.  I'll call her at six.\n                   (pointing)\n            Frederick goes jogging at six,\n            yeah, she'll be alone.  And I'll,\n            I'll call her and nip it in the bud.\n\nThe phone rings.  Elliot jumps.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (loudly, to the\n                   offscreen Hannah, gasping)\n            I've got it!  I've got it!

She talks softly into the telephone.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (into the telephone)\n            I would have hung up if you hadn't\n            answered and I promise I won't ever\n            do this again, but I just had to\n            tell you, I feel very close to you\n            tonight.  Very, very close.\n                   (pausing)\n            Good night.\n\nLee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot,\nstanding in his living room.  Stunned, he slowly lowers the\nphone receiver.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\n \"The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life\n                 is meaningless.\" - Tolstoy\n\nJazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a\nuniversity library, the camera focused on a huge replica of\nRodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance.  Mickey\ncan be seen emerging from its depths.  He wears his raincoat,\nhis hands are in his pockets.  He ponders the scene as he\nwalks past the statue and a small front garden and down the\nsidewalk.  Passersby, some holding books, are seen.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            Millions of books written on every\n            conceivable subject by all these\n            great minds, and, and in the end,\n            none of 'em knows anything more\n            about the big questions of life\n            than I do.  Ss--I read Socrates.\n            You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to\n            kn-knock off little Greek boys.\n            What the hell's he got to teach me?\n            And, and Nietzsche with his, with\n            his Theory of Eternal Recurrence.\n            He said that the life we live,\n            we're gonna live over and over\n            again the exact same way for\n            eternity.  Great.  That means I,\n            uh, I'll have to sit through the\n            Ice Capades again.  Tch.  It's not\n            worth it.\n\nThe movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park.  A male\njogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by.  The\ncamera moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking\nby the reservoir.  He continues to talk over the screen.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            And, and Freud, another great\n            pessimist.  Jeez, I was in analysis\n            for years.  Nothing happened.  My\n            poor analyst got so frustrated.\n            The guy finally put in a salad bar.\n\nSeveral joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            Oh!  Look at all these people\n            jogging...trying to stave off the\n            inevitable decay of the body.  Boy\n                   (smacking his lips)\n            it's so sad what people go through\n            with their-their stationary bike\n            and their exercise and their...\n                   (glancing at a fat\n                   woman jogger in a red\n                   sweatsuit who runs by)\n            ...Oh!  Look at this one!  Poor\n            thing.  My God, she has to tote all\n            that fat around.  Maybe the poets\n            are right.  Maybe love is the only\n            answer.\n\nMickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the\nreservoir.  He stops walking and looks out over the water.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            Shh--Of course, I was in love with\n            Hannah.  That didn't work out too\n            well.\n                   (sighing)\n            I even took her sister out.\n            Remember that?\n\nMickey continues to look through the fence at the water and\nthe distant skyline.  A jogger crosses in front of him.\nIt's very quiet; the soft jazz continues.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            Remember years ago when Hannah and\n            I got divorced and she fixed me up\n            with her sister Holly?\n\nThe film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date\nwith Holly, beginning with a rock club performance.  The\nsoft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock.  Three punkers--a\ngirl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy\nwith Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop\ntheir heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39\nSteps.\n\nThe camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking\nrock band in the midst of their number.\n\n                         THE 39 STEPS\n                   (singing)\n            \"I want to be like you\n            I said I'm going to fit into your\n            group...\"\n\nAs the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the\nspellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small\ntables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly\nsqueezed together at one of them.  A nearby member of the\naudience swills beer from a bottle.  Holly, beating time to\nthe music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette.\nShe wears a wristful of silver bracelets.  She glances at\nMickey impatiently.  He's the only one in the place wearing\na suit.\n\n                         THE 39 STEPS\n                   (singing)\n            \"I don't wanna be different\n            Said I'm gonna be just like you\n            Because I'm gonna buy the records\n            That they play on radio...\n\nHolly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing.\nThe camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing\ninto a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through\nhis cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar.  He\nwears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold\nbracelets on his upper arm.  The microphone screeches\nfeedback.\n\n                         THE 39 STEPS\n                   (singing)\n            \"I'm gonna dance at clubs\n            Gonna do just what I'm told\n            Because I'm bleedin' now\n            And I'm bleedin' now\n            I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip,\n            slip\n            Into the crowd\n            I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip,\n            slip\n            Into the crowd...\"\n\nThe camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-\nlooking Mickey.  They are crowded in with people.  In the\nbackground, a waitress holds up a tray.  A man drinks from a\nglass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band.\nThe club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people.  Holly\nglances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain\nher annoyance.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Oh, why are you making those faces?\n\n                         MICKEY\n                   (leaning over to\n                   Holly, gesturing)\n            I can't hear you.

I don't know how the\n            can opener works.\n\nMickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to:\n\nA beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with\ncourtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by\nwith an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over\nthe scene.\n\nThe music continues as the film moves inside, where the\nchoir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A\nfairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film\ncuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands\nunderneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening\nto the inspiring music.\n\nThe choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father\nFlynn in his office.\n\nHe picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his\nwindow and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his\ndesk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the\nbooks on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the\ntop one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.\n\nNext is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the\ncross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression.\nHis eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit\nthem, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly,\nas the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside\na barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and\nshuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect.\nSmaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking\nChrist.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby;\npassing traffic is reflected in the window.\n\nMickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk\ndown the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-\nair-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving\npedestrians.\n\nWith the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly.\nMickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating\nhim.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door\nand walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag.\nHe switches on the light, and walking past his spiral\nstaircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he\nmakes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls\na crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on\nthe table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He\nthen takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on\ntop of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a\nsaint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is\nnot yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and\na large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on\ntop of the saint.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY\n\nLee is walking down the street, looking around her.  The\nsidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of\ntraffic are heard.  She passes some office buildings, a\nstore's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah.\nHer sister is waiting outside the Art Deco fa\u00e7ade of a\nrestaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction.  Lee\ntaps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and\ngasps.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (overlapping Hannah's gasp)\n            Hi.\n\nThe sisters laugh and embrace each other.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            Hi.

When\n            she's depressed, she's manic.  I\n            think it was a good idea that we\n            invited her to lunch.\n\nThey disappear inside.  The camera follows them, cutting to\nthe restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk\nin.  It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and\nhigh ceilings.  A waiter in uniform stands near its glass\nand metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people\nsit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the\nforeground.  The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area,\ndeep in conversation.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (pulling off her\n                   scarf, still on the\n                   subject of Holly)\n            I hope you tell her it was your\n            idea...\n\n                         LEE\n            Why?\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (overlapping)\n            ...'cause every time I try to be\n            helpful, you know, sh-she gets so\n            defensive.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (unbuttoning her coat)\n            Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just\n            embarrassed in front of you, that's\n            all.\n\nHannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room.\nShe talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and\nspeaking as well.  In the background, a waiter crosses over\nto the bar, then walks away.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen)\n            So how are you?\n\n                         LEE\n            Oh, me, I'm okay.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen)\n            Do you miss Frederick?\n\n                         LEE\n            No.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen)\n            I can't believe Elliot and I can't\n            think of someone nice for you to go\n            out with, you know--\n\n                         LEE\n                   (interrupting, her\n                   voice slightly\n                   higher-pitched as she\n                   takes off her coat)\n            How are you?\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen)\n            I'm okay.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (overlapping)\n            You know, how's everything?

Now only\nHannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk.  In the\nbackground, the waiter once again walks over to the bar.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (continuing)\n            Oh, he's fine.

I never trusted April, you\n            know.  She has eyes in the back of\n            her head.\n\nThey sit down.  The hostess leaves.  Other diners are seen\nin the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple\nsitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table.\nDiners walk in and out.  A low murmur of conversation, as\nwell as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard.  The camera\nmoves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as\nHolly speaks.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Yeah, well, she and an architect\n            are now a very definite item, which\n            I still cannot believe.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (overlapping)\n            Hmm.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            Oh, God...\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (nodding her head,\n                   holding her cigarette)\n            Yeah, although it's put an end to\n            the Stanislavski Catering Company.\n            Which is why I have to speak to you.\n            And...\n                   (gesturing to Hannah)\n            you're gonna get impatient, but...I\n            have to borrow some more money.\n                   (putting her cigarette\n                   in her mouth and\n                   picking up the matches)\n\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (shaking her head)\n            Well, that...th-that's fine.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (gesturing, her\n                   cigarette in one\n                   hand, her matches in\n                   the other)\n            But what I decided to do is some\n            writing.

A little boy sitting in a chair\nnext to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is\nleaning over the arm of the sofa.  An adult guest talks to\nthe little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a\nglass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns\nand addresses the group.\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (gesturing)\n            Now, here...here's a song that\n            Norma sang on that trip we made up\n            to the show in Buffalo.  And, oh,\n            was she beautiful that night!\n\nThe guests laugh appreciatively.  A woman comes over to Evan\nand hands him some wine.\n\n                         NORMA\n            Come on.\n                   (laughing and touching\n                   Evan's shoulder)\n\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (overlapping, to the woman)\n            Thank you, honey.\n                   (putting his drink\n                   down on the piano)\n            Oh, yes, you were, dear.  Don't you\n            remember that night?\n                   (gesturing and\n                   pushing back some\n                   sheet music that was\n                   starting to fall)\n            She was so beautiful...she was so\n            beautiful that when men saw her\n            walking along the streets, they'd\n            drive their cars right up on the\n            sidewalk.\n\nHe laughs; the guests laugh with him.\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (looking back at Norma)\n            Isn't that right, honey, eh?\n\n                         NORMA\n                   (tapping his shoulder)\n            A slight exaggeration.\n\nThe guest continue to laugh; they are charmed.\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (overlapping Norma, laughing)\n            I know.\n\n                         NORMA\n                   (gesturing)\n            But only slight.\n\nEvan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play\nthe piano.  A nearby woman toasts him with her drink.  The\ncamera moves around the room as he plays, showing the\nvarious guests, chattering over the music.  Some are in\nclusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch\nthe offscreen Evan.  A couple stands by the window; one man\ngets up from his chair and walks away.  Some guests sip\ntheir drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano\nand the book-laden wall.  Evan is playing the piano with\nexuberance.  Norma, still standing behind him, has a\npoignant, wistful expression on her face.  She mouths the\nwords to the song Evan is playing, \"It Could Happen to You.\"\nThe woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the\ncamera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing\nin the doorway with a group of children.  Mavis the maid\nwalks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres.  The man takes one,\nmouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open\nbookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and\nmunching, to reveal Lee.  She is leaning against another\ndoorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the\nmusic.  Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway.  Several\npeople, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot,\nholding a drink, walks up behind her.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (sipping his drink)\n            You've been very cold to me tonight.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (glancing back at\n                   Elliot, then turning away)\n            No.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n            Is something wrong?\n\n                         LEE\n                   (turning)\n            Oh, not here.\n                   (touching Elliot's arm)\n            There are too many people around.\n\nLee slips past Elliot and walks away.  Elliot looks back at\nher briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks\noffscreen at the crowd in the living room.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nHolly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen\nfood.  Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a\nglass porthole.  In the foreground, the kitchen table is\ncrowded with bowls and plates of food.  An open cupboard\nseparates Holly from the rest of the room.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (looking offscreen)\n            Hey, Hannah?  You know, I think Lee\n            is really serious about her new\n            boyfriend.  Yeah, eh, from what I\n            understand he sounds really nice.\n\nHannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator.  She\ncarries two tomatoes.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            I'm so happy for her.  I think\n            she's in love.\n\nHannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (reacting)\n            Hey, what's the matter?\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (taking a bunch of\n                   celery out and\n                   slamming the\n                   refrigerator door)\n            I'm real upset about what you wrote.\n\nHannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            My script?\n\n                         HANNAH\n            It's obviously based on Elliot and\n            me.\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Oh, so loosely.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (angrily)\n            No, not \"Oh, so loosely\"!  Real\n            specifically!  Is that how you see\n            us?\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (shrugging, walking\n                   out of the pantry area)\n            Well--\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (interrupting)\n            Can I, can I not accept gestures\n            and feelings from people?  Do I, do\n            I put people off?\n\nHolly walks over to the sink and washes her hands.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (reacting)\n            Well, it's a made-up story.\n\nShe dries her hands as Hannah, her arms laden with\nvegetables, strides over to her sister.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (yelling)\n            No, it's real exact!  The-the\n            situations, the dialogue, everything.\n            It's-it's full of intimate details\n            between Elliot and me!\n            Which I don't, I don't see how you\n            could even possibly know about.  A\n            conversation we once had about\n            adoption?\n\nHannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the\nsink.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (gesturing, the towel\n                   still in her hand, as\n                   she speaks to her\n                   offscreen sister)\n            Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so\n            obviously you discussed it with her.\n            You...\n                   (pacing around the table)\n            I just took the essence and I blew\n            it up into drama.\n\nHolly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the\nkitchen, carrying even more vegetables.\n\n                         HANNAH\n            I don't see how Lee could know\n            about these things.  I don't!  I\n            don't tell her everything.\n\nHannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables\ndown on the counter.  Holly puts the dishtowel down and\nabsently straightens some things on the food-laden table.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (reacting)\n            Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (turning to look at Holly)\n            You make it sound like, you know, I\n            have no needs or something.  You\n            think I'm too self-sufficient?\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (stopping her mindless\n                   straightening at the\n                   table, reacting)\n            Now, Hannah, that's not what I\n            meant, you know.\n                   (walking offscreen to\n                   the sink area)\n            Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you\n            for so much. \"You're so giving.\n            It's not a criticism.  We love you.\n            We're grateful.\"\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (walking out of the\n                   pantry to the food-\n                   laden table)\n            You're grateful, but you resent me.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (offscreen)\n            Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this\n            conversation.  I didn't do anything\n            wrong.\n\nHannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly\nwalks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket.  She stops\nat the corner of the table and faces Hannah.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (onscreen)\n            Y-you mentioned to me yourself that\n            you and Elliot were having some\n            problems.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (gesturing)\n            Yeah, we're having some problems,\n            but problems that are my\n            business...which I don't see how\n            you could know about in such detail.\n            How does Lee know about these\n            things?  How?  They're private!\n\nHannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her\narmload of spices, into the pantry area.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (turning to look at\n                   her sister as she\n                   walks past)\n            Well, why don't you share them with\n            us?\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (with her back to the camera)\n            I don't...I don't want to bother\n            everyone.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (facing her sister's back)\n            That's the point.  I'd like to be\n            bothered.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (turning to look at Holly)\n            I don't see how you could know\n            about these things unless Elliot's\n            been talking to you.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (shaking her head)\n            No, he hasn't.  If I offended you,\n            I'm sorry.\n\nHannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter.\nHolly turns away.\n\nThe film cuts to the dining room doorway.  Guests can be\nseen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet\ntable in the living room.  Lee and Elliot can be heard\noffscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across\nthe empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an\nintense conversation.  The piano, as well as soft chatter,\nis heard in the background.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (offscreen)\n            It's over, Elliot.  I don't know\n            how to make it any clearer.  It's\n            over.  I can't see you anymore.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (offscreen, overlapping)\n            Uh...\n                   (onscreen, gesturing)\n            I-I-I know.  I deserve this.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (touching her chest)\n            Look, I'm just as much at fault.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (overlapping, gesturing)\n            If-if-if you can believe I have\n            such feelings for you!\n\n                         LEE\n            I've got to be honest with you.  I\n            met someone else.  I've met someone\n            else.\n                   (turning and walking\n                   away from Elliot)\n            I...I told you I wasn't going to\n            wait forever.\n\nLee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (offscreen)\n            But it hasn't been forever.\n                   (walking over to Lee\n                   at the just-closed door)\n\n                         LEE\n                   (gesturing)\n            It's been nearly a year since our\n            first time and you're still married\n            to my sister, which...I now realize\n            is fine because you're probably\n            much more in love with her than you\n            know.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (shaking his head)\n            Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (overlapping, gesturing)\n            Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An-\n            an-and in a way you led me on,\n            because I truly believed you were\n            unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I\n            would never have let myself be\n            drawn in.  I was very weak.  So\n            were you.  Now I've met someone else.\n\nThe door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of\ncandlesticks.  She walks over to the dining room table,\nwhich is already decked out with a floral centerpiece,\nglassware, and china.  She puts them down as Lee and Elliot\nstand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (to Mavis)\n            Dinner soon?\n\n                         MAVIS\n            About fifteen minutes.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (nodding)\n            Uh-huh.  Good.\n\nMavis leaves.  Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door\nbehind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n            And you're in love overnight?\n\n                         LEE\n            I care a great deal about him, yes.\n\n                         ELLIOT\n                   (trying to put his\n                   arm around Lee)\n            Lee...\n\n                         LEE\n                   (pulling back,\n                   flinging her hands)\n            Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it.\n            It's over!\n\nThey look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to\nHannah's kitchen.  Norma's face can be seen in the porthole\nwindow on the other side of the pantry's swinging door.  She\nlooks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps\ninside.  Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area.\n\n                         NORMA\n                   (holding the door,\n                   half in and half out\n                   of the kitchen)\n            Sweetheart, I loved your script.  I\n            thought it was so clever.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (turning to Norma,\n                   smiling, and holding\n                   a glass of wine)\n            Well, you're my mother.  Not\n            everybody's gonna be such a sucker.\n\n                         NORMA\n                   (gesturing)\n            I particularly liked the character\n            of the mother.  Just a boozy old\n            flirt with a filthy mouth.\n\nHolly chuckles.\n\n                         NORMA\n            I'm so proud!\n\n                         HOLLY\n            Oh, Mom, thanks.\n\nNorma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut\nbehind her.  Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as\nthe movie cuts back to Hannah's living room.  A chubby,\nfriendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and\nseveral others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor.\n\nThey lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses\nand a bowl of chips.

She sits down\nheavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts\nto several framed photographs on the mantel.  One shows\nHannah and Elliot on their wedding day.  Another shows\nElliot, obscured in the shadows.  Yet another has captured\nNorma as a young girl.  The camera, however, moves closer\nand closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly,\nthe three sisters, smiling into the camera.

MICKEY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nThe screen shows a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray\non a stand sits nearby.  The camera moves down the chaise,\npast several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table.

Trees line the sidewalk.  Holly and Mickey emerge\nfrom the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row\nof similar apartment buildings.  They pass a few other\npeople as they walk.\n\nThe film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and\nstainedwood caf\u00e9.  Through the window, Holly and Mickey can\nbe seen having lunch.  Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey\ntakes a sip of coffee.  Some people pass by.\n\nNext, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central\nPark, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered\nleaves.  Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in\nconversation.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (gesturing)\n            Gosh, you really went through a\n            crisis, you know that?

A close-up\nof a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his\napartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...I really hit bottom.  You know,\n            I just felt that in a Godless\n            universe, I didn't want to go on\n            living.  Now I happen to own this\n            rifle...\n                   (coughing)\n\n\nMickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead.  He\nshuts his eyes tightly.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...which I loaded, believe it or\n            not, and pressed it to my forehead.\n            And I remember thinking, at the\n            time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then\n            I thought...what if I'm wrong?\n            What if there is a God?  I mean,\n            after all, nobody really knows that.\n\nThe camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on\nthe wall behind him.  Its reflection shows his spiral\nstaircase and some standing lamps.  A clock faintly ticks.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            But then I thought, no.  You know,\n            maybe is not good enough.  I want\n            certainty or nothing.  And I\n            remember very clearly the clock was\n            ticking, and I was sitting there\n            frozen, with the gun to my head,\n            debating whether to shoot.\n\nThe gun goes off with a loud bang.  The mirror shatters.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            All of a sudden, the gun went off.\n\nMickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the\nshattered mirror.  The sounds of his excited neighbors,\ntheir shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues\nhis tale.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            I had been so tense, my finger had\n            squeezed the trigger inadvertently...\n\n                         NEIGHBOR #1\n                   (offscreen, overlapping)\n            What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's\n            going on?\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n                   (continuing)\n            ...but I was perspiring so much,\n            the gun had slid off my forehead\n            and missed me.\n\n                         NEIGHBOR #2\n                   (offscreen, overlapping)\n            I don't know.  I heard a gun.  Is\n            everything all right?\n\nMickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit\nliving room.  He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.\n\nFinally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the\ncoffee table.  The gun goes off a second time.  Mickey,\nstanding nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head.  The\ndoorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            And suddenly, neighbors were, were,\n            pounding on the door, and-and I\n            don't know, the whole scene was\n            just pandemonium.  And, uh, you\n            know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.\n\nMickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            I-I-I-I didn't know what to say.\n            You know, I was, I was embarrassed\n            and confused, and my-my-my mind was\n            r-r-racing a mile a minute...\n\nHe returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once\nagain around the living room.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...and I-I jus knew one thing.\n\nThe film cuts to a West Side street.  It's an overcast day.\nMickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several\nother pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including\nKlein's Pharmacy and a \"Bar-B-Q\" take out.  Occasionally, he\nis obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the\nstreet; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that\n            house.  I had to just get out in\n            the fresh air and-and clear my head.\n            And I remember very clearly.  I\n            walked the streets.  I walked and I\n            walked.  I-I didn't know what was\n            going through my mind.  It all\n            seemed so violent and un-unreal to\n            me.  And I wandered...\n\nThe movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater,\nwith its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel.\nAn old publicity photo hangs inside.  Mickey's reflection is\nseen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the\nreflection of the street and various cars whizzing by.  His\nreflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues\nhis story.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...for a long time on the Upper\n            West Side, you know, an-and it must\n            have been hours!  You know, my, my\n            feet hurt.  My head was, was\n            pounding, and, and I had to sit\n            down.  I went into a movie house.\n            I-I didn't know what was playing or\n            anything.\n\nMickey walks into the movie house.  He is seen through the\nglass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic\noutside.  He makes his way through the lobby into the actual\ntheater.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            I just, I just needed a moment to\n            gather my thoughts and, and be\n            logical, and, and put the world\n            back into rational perspective.\n\nThe film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white\nscreen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the\nhelmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live\nxylophone.  The sounds of the \"xylophone\" are heard as the\nmovie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits\ndown in a balcony seat.  The \"xylophone\" music stops and\nchanges to \"Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho\" as sung\nby the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie.  The singing\ncontinues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his\ntale:\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            And I went upstairs to the balcony,\n            and I sat down\n                   (sighing)\n            and, you know, the movie was a-a-a\n            film that I'd seen many times in my\n            life since I was a kid, an-and I\n            always u-uh, loved it.  And, you\n            know, I'm, I'm watching these\n            people up on the screen, and I\n            started getting hooked o-on the\n            film, you know?\n\nThe film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as\nMickey continues to talk.  The Marx Brothers, as well as the\nhundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling\nand bowing as they sing \"Hidee-hidee-ho.\" They kick their\nheels up in the air.  They sway back and forth, hands\nclasped, singing \"Oh-h-h-h-h-h...\"\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...And I started to feel how can\n            you even think of killing yourself?\n            I mean, isn't it so stupid?  I\n            mean, l-look at all the people up\n            there on the screen.  You know,\n            they're real funny, and, and what\n            if the worst is true?\n\nThe movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in\nthe dark theater.  The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the\noffscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            What if there's no God, and you\n            only go around once and that's it?\n            Well, you know, don't you want to\n            be part of the experience?  You\n            know, what the hell, it-i-it's not\n            all a drag.  And I'm thinking to\n            myself, geez, I should stop ruining\n            my life...\n\nAs Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the\nMarx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen.  The\nfour brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting,\ntheir voices indistinct over Mickey's narration.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...searching for answers I'm never\n            gonna get, and just enjoy it while\n            it lasts.  And...you know...\n\nThe film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.\n\n                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n            ...after, who knows?  I mean, you\n            know, maybe there is something.\n            Nobody really knows.  I know, I\n            know \"maybe\" is a very slim reed to\n            hang your whole life on, but that's\n            the best we have.  And...then, I\n            started to sit back, and I actually\n            began to enjoy myself.\n\nAs Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the\nblack-and-white screen.  The Marx Brothers are sitting on a\njudge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other\ncast members.  They jump down from the bench, still singing.\nTheir voices swell.\n\n                         MARX BROTHERS & COMPANY\n            \"Oh, Freedonia\n            Oh, don't you cry for me\n            They'll be coming around the\n            mountain...\"\n\nThe Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the\nmovie cuts back to Central Park.  The flashback is over.\nMickey and Holly continue their stroll as \"You Made Me Love\nYou\" begins to play in the background.  They pass some\npeople, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and\nthe Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the\ncamera moves back, farther and farther away from them,\nshowing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (gesturing)\n            Um...look, there's something I've,\n            uh, that's been bothering me for a\n            long time, and I just thought I'd\n            just tell you what it was and just\n            sort of clear the deck here, and\n                   (chuckling)\n            that's this.\n\n                         MICKEY\n                   (mumbling)\n            Oh, yeah?

HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT\n\nA large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly\nfills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden\ntable in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several\nbowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking\nthrough the doorway.\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (holding a drink)\n            I want ice!  Who's got some--\n                   (pointing to an ice\n                   bucket on the table)\n            Oh, there it is.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen, overlapping)\n            It's on the table, Dad.\n\nThe sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are\ndimly heard; \"You Made Me Love You\" continues softly in the\nbackground.  Mavis passes the table, licking some food off\nher hand.  Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove.\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (putting ice into his glass)\n            Hey, where's Holly?  She's late.\n\nAs Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty\nglasses.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (walking briskly to\n                   the sink)\n            Hey, Hannah, did you read that last\n            thing Holly wrote?  It was great.\n            She's really developed.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (offscreen, in\n                   another area of the kitchen)\n            I know, she...she really writes\n            good dialogue.\n\n                         LEE\n                   (turning to the\n                   offscreen Hannah)\n            Yeah.  I'll get some ice.\n\nLee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air.  Hannah, in\na silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring\nherself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen.\n\n                         NORMA\n            Hannah, can I tell everybody you're\n            going to play Desdemona?\n\nNorma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a\nbottle of gin.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (taking a big sip of\n                   her wine)\n            Oh, Mom, it's only television.\n                   (beginning to mash\n                   some sweet potatoes\n                   in a bowl on the table)\n\n\n                         NORMA\n                   (gesturing with the bottle)\n            Yes, but it's public television.\n            And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get\n            any greater than Othello.  You with\n            some big black stud!  I love it!\n\nNorma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her\nempty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting.\n\n                         HANNAH\n                   (gasping and laughing)\n            Oh, Mom!\n\n                         EVAN\n                   (overlapping, reacting)\n            Oh, honey!\n\nThe movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between\nthe dining room and the living room.  Upbeat jazz plays over\nthe low din of the party.  Two women stand by the partially\nset dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates,\nas Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.  He passes the\nwomen and walks through the doorway into the living room,\nnodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.\n\nHe enters the living room, smiling.  It is crowded with\nguests; Hannah's children play in their midst.  One of\nHannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm.  They playfully \"spar\" for\na moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing\non his way into a connecting room.  He stops at the doorway,\nlooking at the crowd.  The camera shows his point of view:\nGuests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman\nchats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink,\nwalks over to a group of other guests.\n\nThe film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink\nand looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view\nonce more.  This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug,\ntalking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background.\nElliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            Oh, Lee, you are something.\n\nLee and Doug kiss each other.  They continue talking.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            You look very beautiful.  Marriage\n            agrees with you.  Everything that\n            happened between us\n                   (pausing)\n            seems more and more hazy.\n\nAs Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to\nElliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight\nahead.  The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks\nover the scene.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            I acted like such a fool.  I don't\n            know what came over me.  That\n            complete conviction that I couldn't\n            live without you.\n\nThe film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still\ntalking animatedly and smiling.  Lee gently pushes back\nDoug's hair.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n            What did I put us both through?\n            And Hannah...\n\nThe camera moves back to Elliot.\n\n                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n                   (continuing)\n            ...who as you once said, I love\n            much more than I realized.\n\nAfter pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts\nto the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door.\nOne boy opens it, revealing Holly.  She joyfully enters the\napartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (kissing the children)\n            Hi!

Evan's\nrendition of \"Isn't It Romantic\" is heard on the piano as\nHolly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her\nshoulder, walks towards the living room.  She is stopped by\nthree guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a\nman--who are coming out of the room.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (smiling)\n            Huh?

Elliot, holding his drink, walks over\nto her.  They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then\nhugs Hannah, pulling her towards him.  She leans her head on\nhis shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel.  They look\noffscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen\nguests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few\nguests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano.  Norma sits at\nhis side, one arm resting on the piano.  She holds a drink\nand looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to \"Isn't\nIt Romantic.\"\n\nThe camera then moves to the doorway in the living room,\nwhere a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy\ncrowd.  Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song.\nA child plays near the coffee table.\n\nThe camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge\ngrandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den.\nHere, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small\nchair by the sofa.  He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters\nthe room and crouches down next to him, smiling.  She waves\nto him.  He waves back as the camera continues to move past\nthe doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway\nmirror, fixing her earrings.  Mavis can be seen in the\nbackground, through the doorway into the dining room,\nlighting the candles on the table.  She dims the lights,\ndarkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a\nwarm candlelit glow.  Mavis leaves the dining room and\npasses Holly.\n\n                         HOLLY\n                   (still fixing her\n                   earrings, to Mavis)\n            It's beautiful.\n\nMavis walks off.  Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins\nfluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around\nher from behind.  The camera stays focused on the mirror;\nboth Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection.\n\n                         MICKEY\n                   (smacking his lips)\n            Now don't get nervous.
