The camera follows her, moving across a\nbook-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from\nview as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.\nPeople, some holding drinks, some just entering the\napartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once,\ncarrying on easy, familiar conversation.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            She's got the prettiest eyes, and\n            she looks so sexy in that sweater.\n\nLee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.\n\n<b>                         LEE\n</b>            Hi, how are you?\n\nTwo more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full\nnow.  Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as\nshe continues on her way towards the living room.  Elliot's\nvoice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            I just want to be alone with her\n            and hold her and kiss her...\n\nLee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a\nmoment to talk to the child she has just hugged.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            ...and tell her how much I love her\n            and take care of her.

Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray\nof hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them.  The\nspace is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make\nroom for her.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            ...squeezed past me in the doorway,\n            and I smelled that perfume on the\n            back of her neck...\n\nElliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious,\ncontinues to talk.  Elliot reluctantly returns to the\nconversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at\nthe offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            ...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna\n            swoon!  Easy...\n\nThe camera resumes following a smiling Lee.  She has just\nput down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and\nobliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still\nruminating, watches her, entranced.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            You're a dignified financial\n            advisor.  It doesn't look good for\n            you to swoon.\n\nThe camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the\noffscreen Lee.  In the background, guests continue to\nchatter warmly with each other.\n\nHannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind\nthe distracted Elliot.\n\n<b>                         HANNAH\n</b>                   (nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)\n            Elliot?

The film shows the doctors's hands\nturning the dials on a sonometer.  Mickey sits on a nearby\nhigh stool, large earphones on his head.  He listens with\nsuch concentration that he squints his eyes.  He holds up a\nfinger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset.\nFinally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large turning\nfork with his finger.  He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's\near.  Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods.\n\nThe music stops as the film cuts back to Dr. Abel's\nconsultation room.  Dr. Abel walks from the examining room,\nthrough the consultation room, to a second examining room\nacross the way.  He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks.\n\n<b>                         DR.

A nearby member of the\naudience swills beer from a bottle.  Holly, beating time to\nthe music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette.\nShe wears a wristful of silver bracelets.

A pedestrian walks by\nwith an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over\nthe scene.\n\nThe music continues as the film moves inside, where the\nchoir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A\nfairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film\ncuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands\nunderneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening\nto the inspiring music.\n\nThe choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father\nFlynn in his office.\n\nHe picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his\nwindow and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his\ndesk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the\nbooks on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the\ntop one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.\n\nNext is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the\ncross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression.\nHis eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit\nthem, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly,\nas the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside\na barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and\nshuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect.\nSmaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking\nChrist.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby;\npassing traffic is reflected in the window.\n\nMickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk\ndown the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-\nair-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving\npedestrians.\n\nWith the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly.\nMickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating\nhim.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door\nand walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag.\nHe switches on the light, and walking past his spiral\nstaircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he\nmakes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls\na crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on\nthe table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He\nthen takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on\ntop of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a\nsaint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is\nnot yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and\na large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on\ntop of the saint.\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY\n</b>\nLee is walking down the street, looking around her.

The camera follows them, cutting to\nthe restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk\nin.  It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and\nhigh ceilings.  A waiter in uniform stands near its glass\nand metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people\nsit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the\nforeground.

Some are in\nclusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch\nthe offscreen Evan.  A couple stands by the window; one man\ngets up from his chair and walks away.  Some guests sip\ntheir drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano\nand the book-laden wall.  Evan is playing the piano with\nexuberance.  Norma, still standing behind him, has a\npoignant, wistful expression on her face.  She mouths the\nwords to the song Evan is playing, \"It Could Happen to You.\"\nThe woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the\ncamera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing\nin the doorway with a group of children.  Mavis the maid\nwalks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres.  The man takes one,\nmouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open\nbookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and\nmunching, to reveal Lee.  She is leaning against another\ndoorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the\nmusic.  Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway.

She walks over to the dining room table,\nwhich is already decked out with a floral centerpiece,\nglassware, and china.

Norma's face can be seen in the porthole\nwindow on the other side of the pantry's swinging door.  She\nlooks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps\ninside.

A chubby,\nfriendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and\nseveral others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor.\n\nThey lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses\nand a bowl of chips.

Trees line the sidewalk.  Holly and Mickey emerge\nfrom the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row\nof similar apartment buildings.  They pass a few other\npeople as they walk.\n\nThe film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and\nstainedwood caf\u00e9.  Through the window, Holly and Mickey can\nbe seen having lunch.  Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey\ntakes a sip of coffee.  Some people pass by.\n\nNext, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central\nPark, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered\nleaves.  Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in\nconversation.\n\n<b>                         HOLLY\n</b>                   (gesturing)\n            Gosh, you really went through a\n            crisis, you know that?

A close-up\nof a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his\napartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...I really hit bottom.  You know,\n            I just felt that in a Godless\n            universe, I didn't want to go on\n            living.  Now I happen to own this\n            rifle...\n                   (coughing)\n\n\nMickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead.  He\nshuts his eyes tightly.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...which I loaded, believe it or\n            not, and pressed it to my forehead.\n            And I remember thinking, at the\n            time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then\n            I thought...what if I'm wrong?\n            What if there is a God?  I mean,\n            after all, nobody really knows that.\n\nThe camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on\nthe wall behind him.  Its reflection shows his spiral\nstaircase and some standing lamps.  A clock faintly ticks.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            But then I thought, no.  You know,\n            maybe is not good enough.  I want\n            certainty or nothing.  And I\n            remember very clearly the clock was\n            ticking, and I was sitting there\n            frozen, with the gun to my head,\n            debating whether to shoot.\n\nThe gun goes off with a loud bang.  The mirror shatters.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            All of a sudden, the gun went off.\n\nMickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the\nshattered mirror.  The sounds of his excited neighbors,\ntheir shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues\nhis tale.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            I had been so tense, my finger had\n            squeezed the trigger inadvertently...\n\n<b>                         NEIGHBOR #1\n</b>                   (offscreen, overlapping)\n            What's happening?

I heard a gun.  Is\n            everything all right?\n\nMickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit\nliving room.  He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.\n\nFinally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the\ncoffee table.  The gun goes off a second time.  Mickey,\nstanding nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head.  The\ndoorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            And suddenly, neighbors were, were,\n            pounding on the door, and-and I\n            don't know, the whole scene was\n            just pandemonium.  And, uh, you\n            know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.\n\nMickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            I-I-I-I didn't know what to say.\n            You know, I was, I was embarrassed\n            and confused, and my-my-my mind was\n            r-r-racing a mile a minute...\n\nHe returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once\nagain around the living room.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...and I-I jus knew one thing.\n\nThe film cuts to a West Side street.  It's an overcast day.\nMickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several\nother pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including\nKlein's Pharmacy and a \"Bar-B-Q\" take out.  Occasionally, he\nis obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the\nstreet; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that\n            house.  I had to just get out in\n            the fresh air and-and clear my head.\n            And I remember very clearly.  I\n            walked the streets.  I walked and I\n            walked.  I-I didn't know what was\n            going through my mind.  It all\n            seemed so violent and un-unreal to\n            me.  And I wandered...\n\nThe movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater,\nwith its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel.\nAn old publicity photo hangs inside.  Mickey's reflection is\nseen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the\nreflection of the street and various cars whizzing by.  His\nreflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues\nhis story.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...for a long time on the Upper\n            West Side, you know, an-and it must\n            have been hours!  You know, my, my\n            feet hurt.  My head was, was\n            pounding, and, and I had to sit\n            down.  I went into a movie house.\n            I-I didn't know what was playing or\n            anything.\n\nMickey walks into the movie house.  He is seen through the\nglass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic\noutside.  He makes his way through the lobby into the actual\ntheater.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            I just, I just needed a moment to\n            gather my thoughts and, and be\n            logical, and, and put the world\n            back into rational perspective.\n\nThe film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white\nscreen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the\nhelmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live\nxylophone.  The sounds of the \"xylophone\" are heard as the\nmovie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits\ndown in a balcony seat.  The \"xylophone\" music stops and\nchanges to \"Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho\" as sung\nby the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie.  The singing\ncontinues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his\ntale:\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            And I went upstairs to the balcony,\n            and I sat down\n                   (sighing)\n            and, you know, the movie was a-a-a\n            film that I'd seen many times in my\n            life since I was a kid, an-and I\n            always u-uh, loved it.  And, you\n            know, I'm, I'm watching these\n            people up on the screen, and I\n            started getting hooked o-on the\n            film, you know?\n\nThe film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as\nMickey continues to talk.  The Marx Brothers, as well as the\nhundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling\nand bowing as they sing \"Hidee-hidee-ho.\" They kick their\nheels up in the air.  They sway back and forth, hands\nclasped, singing \"Oh-h-h-h-h-h...\"\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...And I started to feel how can\n            you even think of killing yourself?\n            I mean, isn't it so stupid?  I\n            mean, l-look at all the people up\n            there on the screen.  You know,\n            they're real funny, and, and what\n            if the worst is true?\n\nThe movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in\nthe dark theater.  The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the\noffscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            What if there's no God, and you\n            only go around once and that's it?\n            Well, you know, don't you want to\n            be part of the experience?  You\n            know, what the hell, it-i-it's not\n            all a drag.  And I'm thinking to\n            myself, geez, I should stop ruining\n            my life...\n\nAs Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the\nMarx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen.  The\nfour brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting,\ntheir voices indistinct over Mickey's narration.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...searching for answers I'm never\n            gonna get, and just enjoy it while\n            it lasts.  And...you know...\n\nThe film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...after, who knows?  I mean, you\n            know, maybe there is something.\n            Nobody really knows.  I know, I\n            know \"maybe\" is a very slim reed to\n            hang your whole life on, but that's\n            the best we have.  And...then, I\n            started to sit back, and I actually\n            began to enjoy myself.\n\nAs Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the\nblack-and-white screen.  The Marx Brothers are sitting on a\njudge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other\ncast members.  They jump down from the bench, still singing.\nTheir voices swell.\n\n<b>                         MARX BROTHERS &amp; COMPANY\n</b>            \"Oh, Freedonia\n            Oh, don't you cry for me\n            They'll be coming around the\n            mountain...\"\n\nThe Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the\nmovie cuts back to Central Park.  The flashback is over.\nMickey and Holly continue their stroll as \"You Made Me Love\nYou\" begins to play in the background.  They pass some\npeople, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and\nthe Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the\ncamera moves back, farther and farther away from them,\nshowing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time.\n\n<b>                         HOLLY\n</b>                   (gesturing)\n            Um...look, there's something I've,\n            uh, that's been bothering me for a\n            long time, and I just thought I'd\n            just tell you what it was and just\n            sort of clear the deck here, and\n                   (chuckling)\n            that's this.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY\n</b>                   (mumbling)\n            Oh, yeah?

Hannah, in\na silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring\nherself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen.\n\n<b>                         NORMA\n</b>            Hannah, can I tell everybody you're\n            going to play Desdemona?\n\nNorma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a\nbottle of gin.\n\n<b>                         HANNAH\n</b>                   (taking a big sip of\n                   her wine)\n            Oh, Mom, it's only television.\n                   (beginning to mash\n                   some sweet potatoes\n                   in a bowl on the table)\n\n\n<b>                         NORMA\n</b>                   (gesturing with the bottle)\n            Yes, but it's public television.\n            And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get\n            any greater than Othello.

Upbeat jazz plays over\nthe low din of the party.  Two women stand by the partially\nset dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates,\nas Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.  He passes the\nwomen and walks through the doorway into the living room,\nnodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.\n\nHe enters the living room, smiling.  It is crowded with\nguests; Hannah's children play in their midst.  One of\nHannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm.  They playfully \"spar\" for\na moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing\non his way into a connecting room.  He stops at the doorway,\nlooking at the crowd.  The camera shows his point of view:\nGuests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman\nchats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink,\nwalks over to a group of other guests.\n\nThe film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink\nand looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view\nonce more.  This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug,\ntalking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background.\nElliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            Oh, Lee, you are something.\n\nLee and Doug kiss each other.  They continue talking.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            You look very beautiful.  Marriage\n            agrees with you.  Everything that\n            happened between us\n                   (pausing)\n            seems more and more hazy.\n\nAs Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to\nElliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight\nahead.  The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks\nover the scene.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            I acted like such a fool.  I don't\n            know what came over me.  That\n            complete conviction that I couldn't\n            live without you.\n\nThe film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still\ntalking animatedly and smiling.  Lee gently pushes back\nDoug's hair.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>            What did I put us both through?\n            And Hannah...\n\nThe camera moves back to Elliot.\n\n<b>                         ELLIOT (V.O.)\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            ...who as you once said, I love\n            much more than I realized.\n\nAfter pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts\nto the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door.\nOne boy opens it, revealing Holly.  She joyfully enters the\napartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.\n\n<b>                         HOLLY\n</b>                   (kissing the children)\n            Hi!

Evan's\nrendition of \"Isn't It Romantic\" is heard on the piano as\nHolly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her\nshoulder, walks towards the living room.  She is stopped by\nthree guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a\nman--who are coming out of the room.\n\n<b>                         HOLLY\n</b>                   (smiling)\n            Huh?

Elliot, holding his drink, walks over\nto her.  They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then\nhugs Hannah, pulling her towards him.  She leans her head on\nhis shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel.  They look\noffscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen\nguests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few\nguests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano.  Norma sits at\nhis side, one arm resting on the piano.  She holds a drink\nand looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to \"Isn't\nIt Romantic.\"\n\nThe camera then moves to the doorway in the living room,\nwhere a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy\ncrowd.  Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song.\nA child plays near the coffee table.\n\nThe camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge\ngrandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den.\nHere, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small\nchair by the sofa.  He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters\nthe room and crouches down next to him, smiling.  She waves\nto him.  He waves back as the camera continues to move past\nthe doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway\nmirror, fixing her earrings.  Mavis can be seen in the\nbackground, through the doorway into the dining room,\nlighting the candles on the table.  She dims the lights,\ndarkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a\nwarm candlelit glow.  Mavis leaves the dining room and\npasses Holly.\n\n<b>                         HOLLY\n</b>                   (still fixing her\n                   earrings, to Mavis)\n            It's beautiful.\n\nMavis walks off.  Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins\nfluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around\nher from behind.  The camera stays focused on the mirror;\nboth Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection.\n\n<b>                         MICKEY\n</b>                   (smacking his lips)\n            Now don't get nervous.
