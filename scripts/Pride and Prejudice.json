Suddenly Elizabeth\r\n          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played\r\n          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She\r\n          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she\r\n          is outside the room where the music is being played.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          87.\r\n</b>          She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the\r\n          better of her and she discretely peeps in.\r\n\r\n<b>                         \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\r\n</b>          Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful\r\n          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and\r\n          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After\r\n          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly\r\n          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind\r\n          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.\r\n          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She\r\n          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.\r\n          It is Darcy.\r\n          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him\r\n          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.\r\n          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with\r\n          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,\r\n          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DARCY\r\n</b>          Miss Bennet!\r\n          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches\r\n          up with her.

From the drawing room, the sound\r\n          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played\r\n          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.\r\n          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel\r\n          her heart racing.\r\n          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the\r\n          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the\r\n          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite\r\n          smile falters.

He loves\r\n          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no\r\n          doubt.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MR BENNET\r\n</b>          I cannot believe that anyone can deserve\r\n          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I\r\n          heartily give my consent.\r\n          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MR BENNET\r\n</b>          I could not have parted with you, my\r\n          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ELIZABETH\r\n</b>          Oh thank you!\r\n          She starts to rush out.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MR BENNET\r\n</b>          (calls out after her)\r\n          And if any young men come for Mary or\r\n          Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 leisure.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          119.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 134 EXT.

Let everyone have an end.\r\n          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off\r\n          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.\r\n          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy\r\n          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades\r\n          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past\r\n          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to\r\n          Elizabeth and smiles.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DARCY\r\n</b>          Allow me, Mrs Darcy.\r\n          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the\r\n          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by\r\n          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ELIZABETH\r\n</b>          How did it begin?\r\n\r\n<b>                         DARCY\r\n</b>          I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or\r\n\r\n<b>                         \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\r\n</b>          the look.
