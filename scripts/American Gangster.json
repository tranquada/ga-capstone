With his trademark\n    tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a\n    camera - including the Feds - before going inside.\n\n6   INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6\n\n    The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:\n    a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem\n    gangster, Robin Hood and killer.\n\n                              REPORTER ON TV\n                 He was a Great Man, according to the\n                 eulogies. A giving man. A man of the\n                 people. No one chose to include in their\n                 remembrances the word most often\n                 associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:\n                 Gangster.\n\n    Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,\n    heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners\n    circling the place like vultures:\n\n    Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and\n    tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present\n    coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian\n    capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.\n\n                              TOSCA\n                 White wine, please.\n\n    A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down\n    next to Frank.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 How you doing, Frank?\n\n                              FRANK\n                 All right.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 What a loss.\n                        (Frank nods)\n                 How are you otherwise?

It feels unseemly to him to be talking\n    about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery\n    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 Bumpy set something up for you?\n\n    Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where\n    Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.\n\n                              TANGO\n                 Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while\n                 you're at it.\n\n    Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his\n    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He\n    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens\n    a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -\n    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.\n\n    Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope\n    man.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 You going to be all right?\n\n                             FRANK\n                 Yeah.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he\n                 made me promise, anything ever happened\n                 to him, I'd make sure you didn't go\n                 without.\n\n                              FRANK\n                 I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people\n                 here owed Bumpy money when he died. A\n                 lot of money. If they think I'm going\n                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 That's the spirit. Go get them.\n\n    On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime\n    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered\n    that Bumpy's death \"marks the end of an era ...\"\n\n                                                                     5.\n                              \n\n\n\n\nA7   INT.

Someone is going to\n                allow that?\n\n      Frank shrugs. The general regards one of his men.

Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,\n     the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives\n     and kids, and their mother.\n\n     Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as\n     sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar\n     parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for\n     trespassing.\n     The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his\n     dog.

EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY                                   144\n\n      The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue\n      grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car\n      stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.\n\n      Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is\n      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to\n      go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the\n      block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the\n      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who\n      has to double back quickly not to be seen\n\n      Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading\n      crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck\n      on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.\n      Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries               \n      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.                   \n\n                               RICHIE\n                   Get out.\n\n                               TAXI DRIVER\n                   What?\n\n                                RICHIE\n                   Get the fuck out of the car!\n\n      The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and\n      tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets\n      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags\n      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.\n\n      He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,\n      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead\n      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his\n      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -\n\n      The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another\n      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple\n      car-lengths ahead - in sight.\n\n145   EXT.

Richie detours into an alley as\n      they enter the restaurant.\n\n      Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy\n      basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst\n      in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on\n      the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in\n      a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to\n      protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.\n\n      Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but\n      take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride\n      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits.

Just coming off\n      his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented\n      as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement.\n\n                             RICHIE\n                Because it's an attempted homicide,\n                that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury\n                could come in very favorably. Might turn\n                out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self\n                Defense even. She had a knife. Depends\n                on how I want to deal with you. You see\n                where this is going.\n\n      Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.\n\n                             JIMMY\n                The fuck is this place?\n\n                             RICHIE\n                Let's say you beat it somehow.

And then you beat\n                an attempted murder? Is he stupid?\n                He'll assume you talked.\n\n      Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.\n\n\n                                                                   (CONT)\n\n                                                                      79.\n                                \n205   CONTINUED:                                                      205\n\n\n                                RICHIE\n                   You fucked up, Jimmy.

Or do you\n                   want to walk out of here - no bail, no\n                   trial - just walk out, now.\n\n206   EXT.

He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands\n      it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's\n      direction. Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave\n      to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -\n\n                                                                   80.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n211    EXT.
