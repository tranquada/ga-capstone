BANK VAULT - DAY\n</b>\nAn iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of\nthem switches on the lights. On the shelves which line\nthe walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped\npackages, etc. The guards move along the shelves\nsearching for something.\n\n<b>                        WATSON'S VOICE\n</b>           Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in\n           London is a tin dispatch box with my name\n           on it. It is not to be opened until\n           fifty years after my death.\n\nThe guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name\nJOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from\nthe shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with\nheavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the\ncord is the key.\n\n<b>                        WATSON'S VOICE\n</b>           It contains certain mementos of my long\n           association with a man who elevated the\n           science of deduction to an art -- the\n           world's first, and undoubtedly most\n           famous, consulting detective.\n\nWhile one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts\nthe cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the\nkey in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing\nthe dusty contents of the box.\n\n<b>OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE.\n</b>\nThe guards now start to remove the objects from the box,\none at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing,\nand Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes'\ndeerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass;\nWatson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel\nsign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs;\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          2.\n</b>\n\na sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a\nviolin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.;\nA pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a\nphotograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing\nthe initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass;\na worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model\nhypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken,\nproduces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see\na bust of Queen Victoria.\n\n<b>OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE\n</b><b>SUPERIMPOSED.\n</b>\nThe last item out of the box   is a thick stack of\nmanuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon. The guard\nundoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as CAMERA\nMOVES IN CLOSER.  Written in   ink, in the cursive\npenmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph:\n\n          To my heirs:\n\n          In my lifetime, I have recorded some\n          sixty cases demonstrating the singular\n          gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes --\n          dealing with everything from The Hound of\n          the Baskervilles to his mysterious\n          brother Mycroft and the devilish\n          Professor Moriarty. But there were other\n          adventures which, for reasons of\n          discretion, I have decided to withhold\n          from the public until this much later\n          date. They involve matters of a delicate\n          and sometimes scandalous nature, as will\n          shortly become apparent.\n\nOVER THIS, WE HEAR THE VOICE OF DR.

COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWN\n</b>\nThere are but two passengers in the compartment --\nsitting by the window, facing each other. In fact they\nare dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness\ncape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler,\na furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the\nseat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on the\nracks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and\nDR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty-\nthree and thirty-five respectively.\n\n<b>                          WATSON'S VOICE\n</b>             You may recall that he broke the\n             murderer's alibi by measuring the depth\n             to which the parsley had sunk in the\n             butter on a hot day.\n\n<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.

The front door opens\nand MRS. HUDSON,   a plump, motherly woman in her fifties,\nwearing an apron,   hurries down the steps. She greets\nHolmes and Watson   warmly as they alight.\n\n<b>                          WATSON'S VOICE\n</b>             I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but\n             he could also be moody, unpredictable,\n             egocentric, and more often than not,\n             completely infuriating -- as our\n             landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest --\n             bless her kind soul.\n\nThe cabbie   starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes,\nWatson and   Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP\nTHE FACADE   OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the\nbay window   on the second floor.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         4.\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>INT.

Watson has\nremoved his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag\ndown on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their\nluggage, is just leaving.\n\n<b>                       MRS.

ASHDOWN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nThis is a run-down district in the northwestern part of\nLondon. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidated\nabandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up.\n\nAs CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing from\ninside.\n\n\n<b>INT. EMPTY SHOP - DAY\n</b>\nIt is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. In the rear\nwall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into\nthe shop. Nearby stands a large, square object, covered\nwith a tarpaulin.\n\nHigh up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted\nwith an iron grill. From outside, Holmes, in deerstalker\nand Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars.\nWatson and Gabrielle are beside him.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Hammer... Chisel.\n\nWatson hands him the indicated tools. Holmes chips away\nthe cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then\nusing it as a hinge, swings the grill open. He lets\nhimself through the skylight, drops to the floor. Watson\nnow helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her\ntoward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases\nher to the floor. For a brief moment he keeps his arms\naround her. Watson has now squeezed through the\nskylight.\n\n<b>                        WATSON\n</b>          Here!\n\nHe hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor.\nGabrielle is looking around the shop.\n\n<b>                       GABRIELLE\n</b>          It's so strange to think I've been\n          writing to a place like this all these\n          months.\n\nWatson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object.\nHe lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a\nloud twittering of birds.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                      63.\n</b>\n\nWhat he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a\nhundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around\nunside.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Look at all these canaries.

He drops a letter through the slot\nin the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a\nsection of floor which is solidly covered with dust --\nexcept for a series of double tracks, running to the door\nand curving back.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Now we are faced with the most nerve-\n          wracking part of the detective's job --\n          doing nothing.\n\nHe reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into\nanother, to form a cane.\n\n<b>                       GABRIELLE\n</b>          Mr. Holmes --\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Yes?\n\n<b>                       GABRIELLE\n</b>          I don't know how I'm going to pay you for\n          all this.

The noise\nstops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the\nrattle of a chain.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>                 (in a frantic whisper)\n          What do we do now?\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>                 (unfazed)\n          This way.\n\nHe leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right\nnext to the door. They flatten themselves with their\nbacks to the wall, just as the door slides open --\nconcealing them from view.\n\nRevealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an\nold BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair.\nIn her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled\nwith water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled\nwheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the\ncage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the\nceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing\nthe canaries.\n\n<b>                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR\n</b>                 (addressing birds)\n          Good morning, my pretties.

You never told me we had a letter.\n\nShe starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop.\n\nThrough a crack in the door behind which our three are\nhiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her.\n\nThe old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies\nthe address. Then she hears something, glances toward\nthe open rear door.\n\nA horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling\ninto the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's\nseat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the\nback of the wagon. As they start in through the door,\nthe old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels\nherself toward them.\n\n<b>                       FIRST CARTER\n</b>          Morning, Duchess.\n\n<b>                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR\n</b>          Morning.\n\n<b>                       SECOND CARTER\n</b>          What have you been doing with yourself?\n\n<b>                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR\n</b>          What do you think?

The masthead reads:\n<b>INVERNESS COURIER.\n</b>\n<b>                       FIRST CARTER\n</b>                 (counting as he transfers\n                  canaries)\n          ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-\n          four.\n\nHe closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small\ncage.

Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered\ncage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it\nshut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding\nplaces behind the door.

It\nconsists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller\nones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple\nof workmen.

A couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully,\ncaps in hands.\n\nHolmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearby\nheadstone, stop and watch.\n\nAt the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service.\n\n<b>                       MINISTER\n</b>          ... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust\n          to dust.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         88.\n</b>\n\n          In sure and certain hope of the\n          resurrection to eternal life through our\n          Lord, Jesus Christ.

They hand it to a workman, who starts up the\nsteps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass\ndown an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass\nbottles protected by wicker.

Reaching the top, he looks off in the\ndirection of the tower.\n\nThe workman carrying the canary cage, and the two\ncarrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the\ntower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross\nthe moat and enter the tower.\n\n<b>                          HOLMES\n</b>                    (looking off)\n             That tower may be more interesting than I\n             thought -- and not just architecturally.\n\nOut of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two\nmastiffs on leashes.

An ominous mist is beginning to\nsettle on the water.\n\nGabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her\nparasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk\njacket over her dress to ward off the chill.\n\nOn the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes,\nthe latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in,\nand they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite\nside of the lake.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          We have now observed the castle from the\n          front, from the back, from the side, from\n          land, from water... what now?

After it!\n\nHe grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They\nstrain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept\nthe monster.  Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying\nto peer past them through the curtains of mist.\n\nThe monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter\nof a mile away.\n\nSuddenly Watson stops rowing.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Holmes, what are we doing?

As they row, Holmes\nlooks over his shoulder.\n\nThe monster has started to submerge. Its head disappears\nbeneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves\nbehind soon trails off into the mist.\n\nHolmes ships his oar.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          We've lost it.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>                 (stops rowing)\n          At least you admit there's an it, not\n          just a figment of my imagination.\n\n<b>                        HOLMES\n</b>          Quiet.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                      107.\n</b>\n\n\nHe listens intently. There is only the sound of water\nslapping against the side of the boat.

Holmes plugs in\nthe ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends\nthe other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the\nwater.\n\n<b>                        WATSON\n</b>          What is it?\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          I can hear something...\n\nWe become aware of the faint beating of engines,\naccompanied by a bubbling sound.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          It's getting closer -- closer --\n\nSuddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty\nyards away from them, and the head and neck of the\nmonster rear up from the depths. Watson is first to\nnotice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises.\nGabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar,\nthrows it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash\nhits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson\nand Gabrielle are spilled into the lake.\n\nThe monster moves away from them, heading in the general\ndirection of the castle. It disappears into the mist.\n\nHolmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees\nGabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Are you all right?\n\n<b>                       GABRIELLE\n</b>          I lost my parasol.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                        108.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Where's Watson?\n\nHe glances around, sees Watson's bowler floating nearby,\nswims over to it.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Watson?\n\nHe lifts the hat -- but Watson isn't under it.\n\nAs Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson\nclambers over the other side.

A couple of workmen are\nare unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance\nof the tower.\n\nAs Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and\nMycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          Mr. Ashdown, I presume.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>                 (turning)\n          The red runner, I presume.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                       114.\n</b>\n\n                 (indicates carpet)\n          You shouldn't have gone to all this\n          trouble just for me.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          It's not for you.\n                 (calling into tent)\n          McKeller.\n                 (to Holmes)\n          May I have the champagne, please?\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>                 (handing him bottle)\n          1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it?\n\n<b>                        MYCROFT\n</b>          Mediocre.   But then again, it's not for\n          drinking.\n\nA black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroft\ngives him the champagne.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          Tie it up, will you?\n\nThe man moves off toward the tower.   Mycroft pulls back\nthe flap of the tent.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          In here.\n\nHolmes passes inside, Mycroft following.\n\n\n<b>INT. TENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge-\npole. There are several cots, one of them with the\nbedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is a\ntrunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying on\na table, among a group of engineering models, are\nGabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There are\nalso a couple of drafting tables, with plans and\nblueprints tacked to them.\n\nHolmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          Interesting -- and educational.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                             115.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>Despite my most emphatic warning, you\npersisted in meddling.

I think it's an\nexperimental model, operated by a crew of\nmidgets. I think it is powered by\nsulphuric acid batteries, and uses\ncanaries to detect escaping gas...\nAltogether a strange contraption.\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>Not quite that unique. Right now, four\ncountries are trying to develop what we\ncall a submersible. But none of them\ncould solve the critical problem -- how\nto stay submerged long enough to make it\neffective.\n\n<b>             HOLMES\n</b>What does the Good Book say? \"And Jonah\nlived in the belly of that fish for three\ndays and three nights.\"\n<b>\n</b><b>                                            116.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>That was our goal. And thanks to\nValladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the\nrest of them. It's a highly complex\nsystem of filtration -- so we had a\nseries of trials --\n\n<b>             HOLMES\n</b>And at least one error.\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>During a test run in Moray Firth,\npressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea\nwater mixed with the acid in the\nbatteries to produce chlorine gas.\nBefore they could reach the surface,\nValladon and the crew were dead.\n\n<b>             HOLMES\n</b>So you had them buried in unmarked\ngraves, to preserve your secret.\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>It was essential to keep the information\nfrom your client.\n\n<b>             HOLMES\n</b>You went to all those lengths to prevent\nMadame Valladon from fiding her husband?\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's\nthe Imperial German Government. They\nwere after the Belgian engineer -- or\nrather, his invention. They knew he was\nemployed by us, but they couldn't find\nout where -- so they enlisted the best\nbrain in England to help them. You, my\ndear brother, have been working for the\nWilhelmstrasse.\n\n<b>             HOLMES\n</b>And Madame Valladon -- what part did she\nplay in all this?\n\n<b>             MYCROFT\n</b>Madame Valladon is dead.\n\n<b>            HOLMES\n</b>Dead?\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                       117.\n</b>\n\n\nMycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          The Germans disposed of her three weeks\n          ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle\n          Valladon.\n\nHe hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looks\nat it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture\nis of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous\nGabrielle. Holmes lowers  the photograph. Behind it,\nMycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          The woman who was brought to your house\n          in the middle of the night -- apparently\n          fished out of the Thames -- and\n          apparently suffering from amnesia -- is,\n          in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of\n          their most skillful agents. Am I going\n          too fast for one of the \"best brains in\n          England?\"\n\n<b>                        HOLMES\n</b>          Go on.\n\nAs Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked\nparasol and examines it.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          They planted her on you quite neatly, I\n          must admit, so that you could lead them\n          to their objective, the air pump. Very\n          much like using a hog to find truffles.\n          And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I\n          am expecting a certain royal personage\n          from Balmoral.\n\n\n<b>EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the\ndoor of the coach are the initials \"V.R.\"\n\n\n<b>INT.

Lined up on the other side of the\ntorch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in\ntheir best clothes.\n\nOut of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty,\nQUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India.\nShe is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black.\n\nMycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          Your Majesty.\n\nHe bows. The Queen extends her hand to him, and he\ntouches it.\n\n<b>                       MYCROFT\n</b>          I trust you had a pleasant journey,\n          Ma'am.\n\n<b>                       QUEEN VICTORIA\n</b>          It was long and it was tedious.

Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and the\nequerry, then the scientists.\n\nAs they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piper\nfalls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward the\ndrawbridge. Then he steps aside,  as the royal party\ncrosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the\ntower.\n\n\n<b>INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT\n</b>\nA high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron\nstaircase leading down. The floor is a concrete ramp,\nthe lower end of it covered with water. Beyond is the\nentrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and\nvegetation.\n\nOn the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive\nsubmarine, resting on wheels. Prominently lettered on\nthe bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a rope\nfrom the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes\ndelivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted\nover the conning tower is the head and neck of the\n\"monster\" we saw in the lake.\n\nPresent are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an\nofficer. As the royal party comes down the spiral\nstaircase, the officer snaps to attention.

It's quite\n          fatiguing to pin on all those medals\n          while standing on our toes.\n\nThere is the sound of the engines starting. Mycroft\nleads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the\nsub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind.\n\nInside, all is noise and confusion. Metal rods are\ndipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated\nmachinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are\ninflating and deflating, etc. The midgets are at their\nstations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches,\noiling the engines, operating the periscope.

BAKER STREET - DAY\n</b>\nThere is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up\nalong the curbs. Traffic is light. Householders are\nshovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians\nare hurrying along bundled up against the cold.\n\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY\n</b>\nHolmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking\njacket, are at the breakfast table. There is snow on the\nwindow-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate.\nWatson is reading the morning paper. Holmes is sorting\nthrough his mail.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>                 (holding up envelope)\n          H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for\n          membership.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          If only to have the distinct pleasure of\n          blackballing his brother.\n\nHe has slit open the envelope. Watson watches him\ncuriously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face\nremains expressionless. Slowly he puts down the letter,\nrises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out\ninto the wintry street.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Aren't you going to finish your\n          breakfast?\n\nHolmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out\nof the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his\ncoffee.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                        137.\n</b>\n\nThen glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't\nwatching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs.\nIt is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads:\n\n                                   9th December, 1888\n          Dear Sherlock,\n            My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse\n          von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by\n          the Japanese counter-intelligence service\n          for spying on naval installations in\n          Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial,\n          she was summarily executed by a firing\n          squad.\n\n            It might interest you to know that\n\nThe page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of\npaper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the\nother side.\n\n          she had been living in Japan these past\n          few months under the name of Mrs.\n          Ashdown.\n\n                       Sincerely,\n\n                       Mycroft\n\nWatson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with\nhis back to the room, gets up from the table.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>                 (quietly, without turning)\n          Where is it, Watson?\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>                 (after a beat)\n          In the files. May to July, 1885.\n\nHolmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk.   From a\nrow of similar volumes, he slides out the three  files\nmarked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's   the\nmedical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  three\nvolumes pasted on the bottom.\n\n<b>                       HOLMES\n</b>          You're getting better.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                      138.\n</b>\n\n\nHe sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a\nbottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion as\nhe crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in,\nshuts the door.\n\nFootsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a\nmoment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches\nthe door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- a\nshort, nervous man whose features are sharper than his\nmind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his\nhands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.\n\n<b>                       LESTRADE\n</b>          Good morning, Watson.\n                 (stepping in)\n          Just happened to be in the neighborhood,\n          and I thought --\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade?\n\n<b>                       LESTRADE\n</b>          We've had three rather nasty murders in\n          Whitechapel.

Watson starts to ease\nLestrade out of the door.\n\n<b>                       WATSON\n</b>          Good day, Lestrade.\n\nHe shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the\nviolin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker\nchair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out\nof the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his\npen in the inkwell, starts to write.\n\nThe violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitely\nromantic, infinitely sad.\n\n<b>                                                FADE OUT.\n</b>\n\n<b>                         THE END\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Billy Wilder\" title=\"Scripts by Billy Wilder\">Billy Wilder</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=I.A.L Diamond\" title=\"Scripts by I.A.L Diamond\">I.A.L Diamond</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:13:51.030141"}
