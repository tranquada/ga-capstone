In\r\n           just thirty minutes, I felt like my\r\n           whole life was done. Of the\r\n           thirteen maids, seven of us got\r\n           fired. Several other maids got\r\n           fired who had nothin' to do with\r\n           our book. Guess our stories\r\n           weren't so unique after all...But,\r\n           like Minny, we was all free.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

A smug smile forms.\r\n          She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out\r\n          to: TWO-SLICE HILLY!\r\n          Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.
