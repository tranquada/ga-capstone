CIA ARCHIVES - DAY 333\r\n\r\n          And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a\r\n          vault in the basement of the main building.\r\n          Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES\r\n          OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items.\r\n          Separating Mendez's personal things from material related\r\n          to the operation.\r\n          Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a\r\n          sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on\r\n          the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that\r\n          reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.\r\n          Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it --\r\n          it's empty -- no. There's something inside.\r\n          In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO.\r\n          One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer\r\n          is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into\r\n          the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal\r\n          things.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           ARGO - Final 119.\r\n\r\n          334 EXT. CIA - FRONT PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 334\r\n\r\n           O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is\r\n           heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead.\r\n\r\n                          O'DONNELL\r\n           And I left my autograph book at \r\n           home. His Eminence called me. He \r\n          wants to see you.\r\n\r\n                         MENDEZ\r\n          He wants to fire me himself.\r\n\r\n                         O'DONNELL\r\n          He wants to give you the\r\n          Intelligence Star.

Ceremony's two\r\n          weeks from today.\r\n          Mendez stops walking. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         MENDEZ\r\n          If they push it a week, I can \r\n          bring Ian. That's his winter \r\n          break.\r\n\r\n                         O'DONNELL\r\n          The op was classified so the\r\n          ceremony's classified. He can't\r\n          know about it. Nobody can know\r\n          about it.\r\n\r\n                         MENDEZ\r\n          They're gonna hand me an award,\r\n          then they're gonna take it back?\r\n\r\n                         O'DONNELL\r\n          If we wanted applause, we would\r\n          have joined the circus.\r\n\r\n                         MENDEZ\r\n          I thought we did.\r\n          O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder.

Holds tight. \r\n          It's something in between romantic and fraternal. Not\r\n          reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She\r\n          reciprocates. It feels right, and good.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           ARGO - Final 121.\r\n\r\n                         337 CONTINUED: 337\r\n          WIDEN to HOLD ON them holding each other in the dark hall\r\n          of the very American, even Hummel-kitschy house.
