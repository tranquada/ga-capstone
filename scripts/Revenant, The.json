UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp...\r\n          clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on\r\n          an otherwise barren tree.\r\n                         \r\n          A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down,\r\n          landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf\r\n          of the fall, taking its final journey south.\r\n                         \r\n          As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the\r\n          current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement...\r\n          the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until\r\n          DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but\r\n          growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING.\r\n                         \r\n          And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A\r\n          BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we\r\n          rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR\r\n          at the center of the river.\r\n                         \r\n          Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky\r\n          Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling\r\n          wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for\r\n          makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because\r\n          these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched\r\n          wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for\r\n          them to claim their share.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CAMP - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin\r\n          jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around\r\n          his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He\r\n          stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to\r\n          be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his\r\n          gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm.\r\n                         \r\n          From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and\r\n          thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges\r\n          MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life.\r\n                         \r\n                          FITZGERALD\r\n           Likely got a splinter.

Just\r\n           make sure you have the fires ready.\r\n                         \r\n                          FITZGERALD\r\n           My supper's in the hands of a\r\n           hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy.\r\n           Hell, my belly feels full already.\r\n                         \r\n          Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does,\r\n          we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN\r\n          ANSTADT RIFLE.\r\n                         \r\n          The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the\r\n          face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still\r\n          closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and\r\n          filthy, races past.\r\n                         \r\n                          PIG (CONT'D)\r\n           Square as a barn door.\r\n                         \r\n          JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot,\r\n          nods to Glass as he follows Pig.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a\r\n          fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this\r\n          world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he\r\n          was born with it there. Pig crouches over the dead elk...\r\n          grins up at Glass.\r\n                         \r\n                          PIG (CONT'D)\r\n           Right where you said he'd be.\r\n                         \r\n                          BRIDGER\r\n           But bigger than we figured. Gonna\r\n           be a load to haul back to camp.\r\n                         \r\n                          PIG\r\n           Have to split it up I reckon.\r\n                         \r\n                          GLASS\r\n           Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and\r\n           Pig you haul the rest.\r\n                         \r\n          And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow,\r\n          because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail\r\n          off for Bridger.\r\n                         \r\n          Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices\r\n          something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the\r\n          ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt... touches\r\n          a broken twig.\r\n                         \r\n                          BRIDGER\r\n           Another one close by?\r\n                         \r\n          Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby\r\n          brush... inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig\r\n          watch him... exchange a confused glance. And then in a flash\r\n          of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away.\r\n                         \r\n                          PIG\r\n           Hugh?\r\n                         \r\n          Glass just keeps running. Pig and Bridger chase after him.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Pig trips... slams to the\r\n          ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP...\r\n                         \r\n          ...seeing other men playing cards. He stops along the edge\r\n          of camp, drops the wood to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOONE\r\n           No rule says I'm the only one\r\n           that's gotta gather this shit.\r\n                         \r\n          The other men don't even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES\r\n          THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... THWACK... it hits him in\r\n          the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat.\r\n                         \r\n          Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the\r\n          bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. And that's when\r\n          a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that\r\n          arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish.\r\n                         \r\n          AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH\r\n          THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR\r\n          SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.\r\n                         \r\n                          TRAPPER\r\n           `REE!\r\n                         \r\n          WHOOSH...

The camp explodes into chaos... men\r\n          YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other\r\n          as they duck behind trees.\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT...\r\n                         \r\n          ...taking aim at the attacking figures.\r\n                         \r\n          The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and\r\n          hatchets swinging. And this is a massacre... the Arikara\r\n          wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing...\r\n          scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening\r\n          mix of war cries and screams of death.\r\n                         \r\n          Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle...\r\n          BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading\r\n          as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife.\r\n          Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make\r\n          it in time... the warrior leaps toward him...\r\n                         \r\n          ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall...\r\n          flies back to the ground, very dead.

An arrow drives\r\n          into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man\r\n          to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in\r\n          the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS,\r\n          dropping the WARRIOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING\r\n          back at the attacking Arikara.

He crashes face\r\n          first into the shallows.\r\n                         \r\n          The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into\r\n          his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck,\r\n          straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by\r\n          the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to\r\n          Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start\r\n          scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the\r\n          wooden boat.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger\r\n          as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back\r\n          into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the\r\n          warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass\r\n          SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's\r\n          head.\r\n                         \r\n          The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs\r\n          Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck.\r\n                         \r\n                          BRIDGER\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          But Glass is already gone...

His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he\r\n          isn't giving up his rifle.

But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't\r\n          let him lose this tug of war.\r\n                         \r\n                          FITZGERALD\r\n           I'd be careful if I was you, boy.\r\n                         \r\n          And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until...\r\n                         \r\n                          HENRY\r\n           That's enough, Fitzgerald.

THWACK.\r\n                         \r\n          The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but\r\n          Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it\r\n          around to aim it at the boy.

His fingers dig into the earth,\r\n          pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out\r\n          of his own grave.\r\n                         \r\n          He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back\r\n          hits the cold, hard surface.\r\n           38.\r\n          Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he\r\n          has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with\r\n          that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it\r\n          around him.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move...\r\n          his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water...\r\n          and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any\r\n          predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN,\r\n          and drags himself toward the cover of brush.\r\n                         \r\n          And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push\r\n          with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm...\r\n          inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face\r\n          as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues\r\n          on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a\r\n          desperate, hopeless crawl for survival.\r\n                         \r\n          But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain\r\n          overwhelm him.

Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN\r\n          STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands.\r\n                         \r\n          He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing\r\n          he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy\r\n          leg... pull with his good arm.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Every aching\r\n          breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air.\r\n           39.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. MARSH - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature\r\n          cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two-\r\n          foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of\r\n          the marsh, and stops.\r\n                         \r\n          We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying\r\n          among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with\r\n          the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the\r\n          tender flesh beneath.\r\n                         \r\n          Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face...\r\n          arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at\r\n          a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws\r\n          on the Cattail.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He\r\n          flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but\r\n          freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy...\r\n          pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and\r\n          there it is at the bottom of the ridge...\r\n                         \r\n          ...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of\r\n          water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding\r\n          the pain to gulp it down.\r\n                         \r\n          As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows\r\n          beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it\r\n          darts easily away.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he\r\n          feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down\r\n          his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his\r\n          reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched-\r\n          together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off\r\n          the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag,\r\n          and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river,\r\n          then cleaning his wounds.\r\n           40.\r\n                         \r\n          He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the\r\n          open, wet hole. He cups another handful of water to his\r\n          mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT\r\n          OF THE HOLE.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press\r\n          the flesh together... no good. He dumps out his Possibles\r\n          bag... stares at the meager contents. He picks up one of the\r\n          flints... looks to the powderhorn.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

And only then do we realize what he's about to do...\r\n          because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward\r\n          his gunpowder-covered throat.\r\n                         \r\n          The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS,\r\n          igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass falls back to the ground in agony... TRIES TO SCREAM,\r\n          but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him.\r\n                         \r\n          The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads...\r\n          Glass' flesh sears... melts. And the pain is too much for\r\n          Glass... he passes out.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

RATTLING, growing\r\n          LOUDER... FASTER... BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm\r\n          in protection as the snake STRIKES... SINKS ITS FANGS INTO\r\n          HIS FOREARM.\r\n           41.\r\n          He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next\r\n          strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. Glass\r\n          opens his mouth to scream.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens\r\n          from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. His hand\r\n          instinctively jumps to his melted throat. No bites.\r\n                         \r\n          But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same\r\n          RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward\r\n          the sound...\r\n                         \r\n          ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away.\r\n          Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. It's facing the other\r\n          way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock.\r\n                         \r\n          The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. The\r\n          field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs\r\n          through its body, then dies.\r\n                         \r\n          As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse,\r\n          his hand grips a rock. He drags himself toward the occupied\r\n          snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE\r\n          SNAKE'S HEAD.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices\r\n          off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged\r\n          halfway inside. Glass then drags the razor down the length\r\n          of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then\r\n          peels the outer layer down off the rattler.\r\n                         \r\n          With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh,\r\n          Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. He\r\n          gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food\r\n          past his injured throat.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE...\r\n                         \r\n          ...the head, skin, and not much else.\r\n                         \r\n          GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his\r\n          charred, melted throat... no leaks. He opens his Possibles\r\n          bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a\r\n          beat, then slips it over his head.\r\n           42.\r\n                         \r\n          He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws\r\n          a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line...\r\n          a rough guess of his location.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON THE MAP...\r\n                         \r\n          ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. Fort\r\n          Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald\r\n          and Bridger just ahead of him. Then he looks back down to\r\n          his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. He\r\n          looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good\r\n          arm. It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone.\r\n                         \r\n          So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around\r\n          his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK,\r\n          FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. Glass crawls in\r\n          behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to\r\n          carry the weight of his mangled body downstream.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts\r\n          floating... letting the river do the work. He watches the\r\n          land move past him faster than it has in days... and without\r\n          all the agony of every move.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Winding through the open prairie. Glass hangs onto the\r\n          log... floats with the gentle current.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. Glass\r\n          floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the\r\n          riverbank. The animals don't even notice him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs\r\n          over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes\r\n          closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then\r\n          his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything\r\n          clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too\r\n          dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in\r\n          front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air.\r\n           43.\r\n                         \r\n          But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog,\r\n          scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty...\r\n          that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST\r\n          AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but\r\n          it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside\r\n          down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT\r\n          WATERFALL.\r\n                         \r\n          He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current.\r\n          He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They\r\n          pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out.\r\n                         \r\n          The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing...\r\n          turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he\r\n          spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking\r\n          him down the rocky gauntlet.\r\n                         \r\n          He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps\r\n          loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped\r\n          down another set of falls.\r\n                         \r\n          The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the\r\n          rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body\r\n          drifts face-down toward shore.\r\n                         \r\n          And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his\r\n          arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the\r\n          muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded\r\n          in that mist.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The sun beats down... then\r\n          SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing\r\n          over Glass.\r\n                         \r\n          And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME...\r\n                         \r\n          ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it...\r\n          stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see\r\n          THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing\r\n          at his battered wounds.\r\n           44.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away.\r\n          He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from\r\n          his throat.\r\n                         \r\n          The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing\r\n          to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks\r\n          on his flesh.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them\r\n          back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the\r\n          sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM...\r\n          waiting for him to die.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He\r\n          glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away.\r\n                         \r\n          At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free,\r\n          creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it.\r\n          And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than\r\n          when he started this journey.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the\r\n          cave floor... he must be dead. The rabbit continues on past.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. CAVE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. He stares\r\n          straight ahead, unmoving.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CAVE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the\r\n          sun, as he takes in the scene.\r\n                         \r\n          The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered\r\n          and muddy. The water is thick and brown with all the flooded\r\n          earth it pulled up.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then\r\n          higher... onto his healthy leg. He braces himself against a\r\n          tree. He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first\r\n          time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than\r\n          an animal. He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred\r\n          up from the flood. He moves along the washed-out area,\r\n          searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from\r\n          the ground to chew on the roots.\r\n                         \r\n          He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in\r\n          the flood, frozen on its back. Glass kneels down to pick up\r\n          the turtle... sniffs it. As he does, he spots something\r\n          across the river... a DEER, staring back at him.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim\r\n          at the deer... pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt.\r\n                         \r\n          But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass.\r\n          Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and\r\n          the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the\r\n          flood. He looks back across the river... THE DEER IS LONG\r\n          GONE.\r\n           47.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now\r\n          crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... HIS\r\n          FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him.\r\n          He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could.\r\n          So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet-\r\n          first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him,\r\n          wiping them away as he moves. And his eyes are locked on the\r\n          Arikara... watching to see if they spot him.\r\n                         \r\n          But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward...\r\n          five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky\r\n          water and sludge. But if he goes any further, the current\r\n          will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent\r\n          rapids... and make him a clear target.\r\n                         \r\n          The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep\r\n          coming... near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         UNDERWATER -\r\n                         \r\n          And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. He\r\n          grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the\r\n          rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the\r\n          river bottom.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to\r\n          the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         UNDERWATER -\r\n                         \r\n          Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up\r\n          through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY\r\n          A FEW FEET AWAY.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass...\r\n          looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the\r\n          surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see\r\n          anything below.\r\n           48.\r\n                         \r\n          But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to\r\n          explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't...\r\n          and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until\r\n          finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path.\r\n                         \r\n          Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in\r\n          some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into\r\n          the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and\r\n          boulders... pulling himself to the other side.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy\r\n          water of the Grand.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD\r\n          MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the\r\n          ground after it. He's starving to death.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a\r\n          cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the\r\n          cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin\r\n          boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the\r\n          rainfall that it's caught.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak...\r\n          starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to\r\n          his hands and knees.\r\n                         \r\n          And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling\r\n          under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration.\r\n          A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest\r\n          of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a\r\n          HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.\r\n           49.\r\n                         \r\n          An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their\r\n          hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind\r\n          them.\r\n                         \r\n          Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN\r\n          BUFFALO.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND\r\n          SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the\r\n          closest he's been to food in days.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts\r\n          bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads\r\n          snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS.\r\n                         \r\n          And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass...\r\n          limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a\r\n          BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS\r\n          clawing in the night.\r\n                         \r\n          The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching.\r\n          They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his\r\n          best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He\r\n          swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the\r\n          air.\r\n                         \r\n          The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But\r\n          Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames...\r\n          driving each wolf back.\r\n                         \r\n          Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its\r\n          ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away...\r\n          SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure\r\n          what its up against.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS'\r\n          ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across\r\n          the wolf's head.\r\n                         \r\n          The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns\r\n          back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready...\r\n          throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it\r\n          with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn.\r\n                         \r\n          The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground,\r\n          then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe\r\n          distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass.\r\n           50.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground,\r\n          igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming\r\n          wall between him and the wolves.\r\n                         \r\n          He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds\r\n          the fallen buffalo.\r\n                         \r\n          The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the\r\n          flames.\r\n                         \r\n          As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants...\r\n          attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of\r\n          flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a\r\n          starving animal that's finally found food.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Glass and the buffalo at the\r\n          center of that glowing ring of fire.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up\r\n          to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something\r\n          in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE.\r\n          Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of\r\n          roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. He starts to\r\n          take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE\r\n          BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass freezes... he isn't alone. He rises... grabs a\r\n          splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway...\r\n          raises the post to swing...\r\n           51.\r\n                         \r\n          ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room.

And her eyes\r\n          are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A\r\n          CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this\r\n          stranger to kill her.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass stands frozen... confused. He tries to speak, but his\r\n          throat still won't let him. He crouches down in front of the\r\n          old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away.\r\n          He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she\r\n          calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and\r\n          bones... she's obviously dying.\r\n                         \r\n          He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes\r\n          it into the squaw's hand. She immediately jerks it to her\r\n          mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH...\r\n          she can't eat.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He tries to ease it into her\r\n          hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up\r\n          Glass' arm to his face... patting it...

The squaw lies atop the pyre,\r\n          covered in the blankets he gathered for her. Glass stands\r\n          beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand.

FAST.\r\n                         \r\n          And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so\r\n          he just stands there. But the dog's seen enough... darts\r\n          away.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their\r\n          braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've\r\n          seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass\r\n          knows it.\r\n                         \r\n          The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass.\r\n          The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong,\r\n          points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass.\r\n           53.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat.\r\n          Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two\r\n          warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same...\r\n          close in on Glass.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse says something else to him.\r\n          Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from\r\n          his sides... no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard...\r\n          reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost\r\n          testing to see if the color comes off.\r\n                         \r\n          One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says\r\n          something to the others. Spotted Horse and the other warrior\r\n          join him, each touching Glass' hair.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw\r\n          hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to\r\n          Glass' stitching and scars.\r\n                         \r\n                          SPOTTED HORSE\r\n           Griz-lee.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass hears the familiar word... nods. Three Feathers pulls\r\n          a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to\r\n          Spotted Horse.\r\n                         \r\n          Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused...\r\n          holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three\r\n          Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his\r\n          jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted\r\n          Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass\r\n          GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down\r\n          Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a\r\n          MASS OF WHITE WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON\r\n          GLASS' BACK.\r\n                         \r\n          The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously\r\n          never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction...\r\n          throws a nervous glance... what?\r\n                         \r\n          Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a\r\n          HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in\r\n          panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against\r\n          Glass' head.\r\n                         \r\n          Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted\r\n          Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass\r\n          tumbles unconscious to the dirt.\r\n                         \r\n          Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab\r\n          Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses.\r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various\r\n          tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the\r\n          village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other\r\n          riders splash across the stream.\r\n                         \r\n          The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over\r\n          the back of Three Feather's horse.

Glass CRIES\r\n          OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. As he\r\n          does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing\r\n          back... sliding to the center of the river.\r\n                         \r\n          The thin ice around him splinters... cracks.

Fitzgerald\r\n          speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the\r\n          knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the\r\n          surface.\r\n                         \r\n          Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his\r\n          feet, forcing him back.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          UNDERWATER...\r\n                         \r\n          ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current.\r\n          His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n           102.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          FITZGERALD...\r\n                         \r\n          ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice,\r\n          searching for Glass.
