It comes from \"The\r\n           Iliad,\" but I think it was popularized by\r\n           Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:\r\n           ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the\r\n           woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,\r\n           also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I\r\n           mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,\r\n           cuz he's been eating Mexican. The\r\n           wiping's taking forever, and his shit\r\n           keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what\r\n           happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the\r\n           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The\r\n           rabbit says no, shit just slides right\r\n           off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up\r\n           and wipes his ass with him.\r\n           (pause, as if for applause)\r\n           Well, I never said it was a good joke.\r\n           And see, that makes it perfect, because\r\n           it's pretty much the story of my life.\r\n                         \r\n           We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-\r\n           shirt and old jeans.

Even if I did spend my\r\n           childhood hearing my father go on and on\r\n           about how, like, Nirvana would never mean\r\n           anything because they're not the Beatles,\r\n           blah-blah.

Julie, Beth, and Annie.\r\n           Three women in my life and I was\r\n           desperate for one.\r\n                         \r\n          REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps\r\n          the headphones over her ears.\r\n                         \r\n           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)\r\n           Of course, I saw her again. It's a small\r\n           campus. The last time was at a film\r\n           festival. We're better friends now then\r\n           ever, and there's always a chance we can\r\n           have some kind of future together. So\r\n           far, so good.\r\n                         \r\n          Finally, Beth turns and walks away.\r\n                         \r\n          CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller.\r\n          Soon all we see is fog.\r\n                         \r\n           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)\r\n           She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's\r\n           nice to run into her and reminisce about\r\n           what we, ya know, went through. It was a\r\n           weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I\r\n           really got off track there, didn't I?\r\n                         \r\n<b>           FADE TO BLACK\r\n</b><b>                          \r\n</b>\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Burning-Annie.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Burning Annie</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Zack Ordynans\" title=\"Scripts by Zack Ordynans\">Zack Ordynans</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Burning Annie Script.html#comments\" title=\"Burning Annie comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:01:35.703106"}
