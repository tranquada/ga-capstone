Phew!\n               One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually\n               forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits\n               there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the\n               contents.\n\n                                          BOB (CONT'D)\n\n                                 (OBLIVIOUS)\n                            Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here,\n                            huh?\n               The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's\n               bag and inspects it.\n\n                                          YOUNG IRAQI\n                                 (to the other)\n                            Deep Purple.\n               They laugh.\n\n                                          BOB\n                                 (laughing too)\n                            Oh, you speak English?

You like rock or, or...\n               He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN.\n               The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over\n               the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes\n               off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it.\n\n                                          BOB (CONT'D)\n                                 (smile fading)\n                            Lyn?

From next door comes the\n               faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.\n\n                                          BOB\n                            We're going to die!

When I said I was\n                            retired from the unit, that was a\n                            lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was\n                            just my cover. I've been\n                            reactivated. I couldn't tell\n                            you because this is a Black Op,\n                            but...I think you have a part to\n                            play. I think that's why you're\n                            with me.\n               Bob collapses face down on the mattress.\n\n                                          BOB\n\n                                 (MUFFLED)\n                            You're an idiot.

(Starting to cry a little)\n                            I got drunk and I just wanted to\n                            get into Iraq so I could prove to\n                            my wife I wasn't...just once that\n                            I...And now I'm going to die.\n                            She's right.

(No answer)\n                            Your life is like a river, Bob. If\n                            you're aiming for a goal\n                            that isn't your destiny, you will\n                            always be swimming against the\n                            current. Young Ghandi wants to be\n                            a stock-car racer? Not gonna\n                            happen. Little Anne Frank wants to\n                            be a High School teacher. Tough\n                            titty Anne. That's not your\n                            destiny.

Groggily Bob opens his eyes\n                just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him,\n                the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it\n                pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination.

He staggers, barely able to put one\n                foot in front of the other.\n                At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves\n                looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms.
