Next he \"lands\" Buzz\nLightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's\nlaser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if\nhe'd been blown away by the laser.\n\nC) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and\ncowboy pajamas.\n\n<b>                                            MATCH CUT TO:\n</b>\nAndy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas\nand a homemade spaceman's helmet.\n\n<b>                         ANDY\n</b>            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.\n\nD) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom\ntransform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the\nwall, the pillow, the bedspread.\n\nE) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger\nsuggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this\ntime giving a \"JURASSIC PARK\" ROAR.\n\nThe roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.\n\nF) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of\nBuzz.\n\nWoody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's\nhair, chatting away like a hair dresser.\n\nWoody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.\n\nG) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys\nas weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,\nusing his feet as a treadmill.\n\nPotato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends\nup tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the\nbarbell.\n\nH) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the\ncheckerboard.\n\nWoody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and\nRobot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's \"ship\" up on\ntop of ABC blocks for repair.\n\nIn frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the\npieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the\ndresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.\n\nI) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is\nstretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's\nwagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.\n\nWoody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his\nfront end no choice but to eventually follow.\n\nJ) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until\njust Woody and Buzz are left.
