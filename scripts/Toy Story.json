His eyes widen at the sight of...\n\nBUZZ LIGHTYEAR\n\nWe see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age\naction figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head\nto toe.

ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER\n\nA) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,\nrunning around the room.\n\nB) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he \"lands\" Buzz\nLightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's\nlaser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if\nhe'd been blown away by the laser.\n\nC) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and\ncowboy pajamas.\n\n                                            MATCH CUT TO:\n\nAndy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas\nand a homemade spaceman's helmet.\n\n                         ANDY\n            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.\n\nD) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom\ntransform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the\nwall, the pillow, the bedspread.\n\nE) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger\nsuggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this\ntime giving a \"JURASSIC PARK\" ROAR.\n\nThe roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.\n\nF) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of\nBuzz.\n\nWoody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's\nhair, chatting away like a hair dresser.\n\nWoody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.\n\nG) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys\nas weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,\nusing his feet as a treadmill.\n\nPotato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends\nup tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the\nbarbell.\n\nH) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the\ncheckerboard.\n\nWoody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and\nRobot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's \"ship\" up on\ntop of ABC blocks for repair.\n\nIn frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the\npieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the\ndresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.\n\nI) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is\nstretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's\nwagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.\n\nWoody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his\nfront end no choice but to eventually follow.\n\nJ) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until\njust Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which\ntoy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.\n\nINT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\nAndy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next\nto him.\n\nWoody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks\nback into the box, closing the lid to...\n\nBLACK\n\nEND MONTAGE/SONG ENDS\n\nThe black screen splits horizontally to become...\n\nINT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM\nFROM THE TOY BOX\n\nAll is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid\nof the toy box.\n\n                         WOODY\n            Finally!\n\nHe takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers\nthat his hat is missing.\n\n                         WOODY\n                   (looking back into\n                   the toy box)\n            Hey!

That's it!\n\nWoody angrily marches across the room.\n\nAcross the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the\nABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under\nthe ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting\nfor instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.\n\n                         BUZZ\n            Unidirectional bonding strip.\n\nRobot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape\ndispenser.\n\n                         ROBOT\n            Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!\n\nSnake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.\n\nWoody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot\nand rolls him out from under the ship.\n\n                         WOODY\n            Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away\n            from Andy.

Woody rolls him out again.\n\n                         WOODY\n            And another thing.  Stop with this\n            spaceman thing.

He drops to his knees\nand begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.\n\nWoody is unsure how to react.\n\nSuddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.\n\n                         BUZZ\n            The air isn't toxic.\n\nBuzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.\n\n                         BUZZ\n            How dare you open a spaceman's\n            helmet on an uncharted planet!
