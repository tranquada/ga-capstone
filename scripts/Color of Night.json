We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see\r\n          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the\r\n          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and\r\n          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.\r\n           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various\r\n          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.\r\n           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not\r\n          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which\r\n          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her\r\n          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away\r\n          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           God !...... No !......\r\n                         \r\n          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She\r\n          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her\r\n          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in\r\n          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.\r\n           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put\r\n          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the\r\n          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to\r\n          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while\r\n          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.\r\n                         \r\n          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,\r\n          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more\r\n          understandable...\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL'S VOICE\r\n           So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a\r\n           specific answer...\r\n                         \r\n          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green\r\n          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.\r\n           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-\r\n          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves\r\n          with leather-bound books.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower\r\n           of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real\r\n           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points\r\n           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...\r\n                         \r\n          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is\r\n          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no\r\n          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and\r\n           swoop down to finish me off.\r\n          He stands up.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You\r\n           think that everything got to be either black or white\r\n           because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He\r\n           knows I'm not like you\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           We all do what ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a\r\n           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have\r\n           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           I don't know what you mean.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You invent enemies to test your strength against. You\r\n           invent gods to protect you from these enemies.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n          Cutting him.\r\n           What a depressing view of life you have, that is such\r\n           horse-shit !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next\r\n           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder\r\n           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember\r\n           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           No, why don't you tell me\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Take a look in the mirror, Michelle\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n           Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Any mirror. Tell me what you see.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHELLE\r\n          We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.\r\n           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there\r\n           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the\r\n           view outside actually...\r\n                         \r\n          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with\r\n          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward\r\n          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her\r\n          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells\r\n          \u00abMichelle\u00bb twice.\r\n                         \r\n          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office\r\n          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A\r\n          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if\r\n          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from\r\n          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.\r\n                         \r\n                          SEVERAL VOICES\r\n           All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your\r\n           car... Stop it...\r\n                         \r\n          BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,\r\n          and look outside.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          Voice over.\r\n           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around\r\n           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...\r\n                         \r\n          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He\r\n          finishes the preceding reply.\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from\r\n           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.\r\n                         \r\n          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and\r\n          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of\r\n          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and\r\n          then they become grey.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.\r\n          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but\r\n          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.\r\n          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the\r\n          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York\r\n          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : \u00abPatient's\r\n          family sues Manhattan shrink\u00bb\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I\r\n           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Starts to stand up.\r\n           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a\r\n           bitch.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.\r\n          Bill laughs.\r\n           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her\r\n           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking\r\n           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that\r\n           easily.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with\r\n           anyone else ?\r\n                         \r\n          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated\r\n          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey\r\n          cat who is lying on the table.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be\r\n           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of\r\n           them want to love me\r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage\r\n           once.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody\r\n           else to death.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to\r\n           deny emotion.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Oh yeah !\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           As you know, that could be very dangerous.\r\n                         \r\n          Bill stands up.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got\r\n           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get\r\n           fixed.\r\n                         \r\n          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man\r\n           like you to forgive himself.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.\r\n                         \r\n          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Don't run away because of one treatment failure.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los\r\n           Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up\r\n           here, isn't it...\r\n          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.\r\n           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.\r\n                         \r\n          ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing.\r\n          On these two short shots, we hear :\r\n                         \r\n                          STEWARDESS\r\n           Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain\r\n           seated until the aircraft comes...\r\n                         \r\n          The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed\r\n          with the sound of a radio set in a car.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE IN THE RADIO\r\n           Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender\r\n           on 405, slowing thing down.\r\n                         \r\n          TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.\r\n          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign\r\n          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill\r\n          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo\r\n          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAXI DRIVER\r\n           Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an\r\n           accident !...\r\n          Short shot of the accident.\r\n           ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?\r\n          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves\r\n          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.\r\n           What are you doing ?

Furniture is modern and functional, but with a\r\n          little personal touch.\r\n           Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then\r\n          we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is\r\n          dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie,\r\n          a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless\r\n          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her\r\n          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear\r\n          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a\r\n          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice\r\n          counting the books on a shelf.\r\n                         \r\n           BITS OF CONVERSATION\r\n           Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK...

Bill seems impressed by the\r\n          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob\r\n          stops the car and they get out of it.

The best and\r\n          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings\r\n          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on\r\n          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the\r\n          pictures from all the security cameras.\r\n           So, how are we as we approach forty ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           We are in a good shape.

So...\r\n          Bill plays with a \u00abpiece of art\u00bb, consisting of an assembly of\r\n          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The\r\n          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you\r\n          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.\r\n           You're ready yet ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Ready to what ?\r\n          We see the distorted face of Bill through the \u00abpiece of art\u00bb, or\r\n          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of\r\n          the individual square of glass.

So hard to talk about...\r\n          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.\r\n           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game.

What make you think it's somebody in the\r\n           group ?\r\n                         \r\n          Bob spins the pedals to check the chain.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple\r\n           of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Call the cops ?...\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n          He puts his bike back on the wheels.\r\n           Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in\r\n           L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if\r\n           anything happened.\r\n                         \r\n          They put their sunglasses on.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He laughs.\r\n           That makes sense.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah !\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           How about you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           About me... what ?\r\n          We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider\r\n          rides near them.\r\n           What would you give a suicidal patient that's got\r\n           everything ?\r\n          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back\r\n          wheel.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Parachute, I heard it already.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Out here already, huh ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Come on, old timer !...\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in.\r\n          They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their\r\n          bikes on the ground.\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.\r\n                         \r\n          They hold each other by the waist and the shoulders.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about\r\n           that : \"Learning to loose\" by Doctor Bill Capa !\r\n                         \r\n          A beep and the second gate gets open.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Got a ring to it !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !\r\n                         \r\n          They enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Short low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's\r\n          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.\r\n          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session\r\n          with a patient.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           See you next week. All right ?\r\n                         \r\n          He escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's\r\n          secretary.\r\n                         \r\n                          BARBARA\r\n           I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?\r\n                          BOB\r\n           That'll be great, Barbara.\r\n                         \r\n          She gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes\r\n          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the\r\n          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his\r\n          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange\r\n          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer\r\n          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his\r\n          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and\r\n          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes\r\n          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels\r\n          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He\r\n          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that\r\n          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.\r\n          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his\r\n          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was\r\n          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves\r\n          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,\r\n          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through\r\n          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           Barbara ?...\r\n                         \r\n          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the\r\n          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We\r\n          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the\r\n          glass on the door.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely\r\n          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass\r\n          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets\r\n          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and\r\n          falls down.\r\n           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a\r\n          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top\r\n          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers\r\n          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of\r\n          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He\r\n          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns\r\n          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles\r\n          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by\r\n          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.\r\n                         \r\n                          BOB\r\n           No... Nooooo !... Why ?\r\n                         \r\n          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He\r\n          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his\r\n          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his\r\n          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over\r\n          Los Angeles.\r\n          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue\r\n          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter\r\n          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at\r\n          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the\r\n          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a\r\n          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.\r\n          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes\r\n          Bill into the building.\r\n                         \r\n          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Classical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms\r\n          are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in\r\n          front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy\r\n          clothes.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN\r\n           Have you thought about...\r\n                          THE HOOKER\r\n           Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very\r\n           cute. I love you.\r\n                         \r\n           THE POLICE OFFICER\r\n           I love you too !\r\n                         \r\n          Anderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits\r\n          down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink\r\n          shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open\r\n          collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file\r\n          in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           You're Capa ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind\r\n          the desk.\r\n           You're here because of the dead doctor ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yes...\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about\r\n           this Monday group.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember\r\n           their names right now.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental\r\n          illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his\r\n          hand.\r\n           Like five cuckoos.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At\r\n           least, that's what Bob thought.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Bob Moore ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Good.

Anderson ! This is civilization, man.\r\n           What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...\r\n          Anderson gives Bill the cup.\r\n           Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like\r\n           that, bro. Hey !\r\n          Anderson leaves the room and closes the door.\r\n           It's third world thing !...

You can go home now, take a shower.\r\n          He turns back to Bill.\r\n           And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going\r\n           for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't\r\n           want the press fucking things up.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n          Bill plays with the \u00abpiece of art\u00bb made of pieces of glass. He\r\n          pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We\r\n          then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that\r\n          Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the\r\n          house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the\r\n          bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe.

On the wall near\r\n          the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On\r\n          the screen, we see Hector's face.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Oh shit !\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Hector is waiting in front of the gate. He is wearing a grey\r\n          shirt, a beige blazer and a necktie, and a police badge on his\r\n          belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police\r\n          officer.

He quickly looks\r\n          through the books, takes a step back, then thrusts his hand behind\r\n          a row of books, and grabs a photo album. While flipping through\r\n          the pages, he goes to the sofa and sits next to Bill. Bill is\r\n          wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Hector goes on turning\r\n          the pages, and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked\r\n          woman.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Nice bush !\r\n                         \r\n          Bill closes the album, takes it from Hector's hands and gets up.\r\n          He turns to look at Hector.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I'll tell you said so...\r\n          He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found.\r\n          He looks at Hector.\r\n           I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Close-up of the head of the bed.

The gate starts sliding between him and Hector.\r\n           Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in\r\n           this relationship is wasted.

In the rear-view mirror of the car, we\r\n          see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof\r\n          open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps\r\n          into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car.\r\n           I have to call you back.

Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a\r\n           window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in\r\n           right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's\r\n           turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so\r\n           I can't help you...

I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than\r\n           happy to help you in anyway.\r\n          Clark gives his business card to Bill, who takes it. Then he gives\r\n          him a kleenex. Bill wipes his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          We see, through the window, light-beams crossing in the sky.\r\n                         \r\n          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Usual atmosphere of a well-known bar. At a short distance from the\r\n          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of\r\n          which are sweeping the sky. Those beams make the connection with\r\n          the preceding scene.\r\n                         \r\n          THE WHISKY BAR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Quick shot on the very noisy orchestra. A long hair bearded guy is\r\n          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed\r\n          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.\r\n          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits\r\n          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.\r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           You bring me a confession ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Listen, maybe it was not one of the group\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob\r\n           Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hey... Why...

They used to come here a lot.\r\n           I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's\r\n           parents. It's a nice place. I like it.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for\r\n           you. I'll see you around.\r\n                         \r\n          Bill gets up and leaves the bar. Hector gets up behind him and\r\n          follows him. They meet back in the street.\r\n                         \r\n          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           So, that's it, hey ?\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Anything you want to tell me ?...\r\n                         \r\n          They put back their jackets.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n                          NO\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE OF THE CAR VALET\r\n           Yeah, it's a four-door, man !\r\n                         \r\n          Hector and Bill are walking slowly in front of the bar.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           So you better shut the group down.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Who say I hadn't ?\r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Oh, have you or haven't you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           They ask me to take over the group.

Are you really color-blind, or is\r\n           that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for\r\n           you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No, unfortunately I am color...

He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive\r\n          Bill on the sidewalk.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked\r\n          behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind\r\n          the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.\r\n          He presses a switch to close the gate.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n          Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and\r\n          walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a\r\n          moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor !\r\n          He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the\r\n          whole floor is flooded.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a\r\n          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the\r\n          corridor.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see\r\n          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which\r\n          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out\r\n          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor\r\n          and turns off the garden hose faucet.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he\r\n          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet\r\n          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already\r\n          drying.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Hello !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Who's there ?\r\n                         \r\n          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Hi !...

We are looking above\r\n          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing\r\n          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and\r\n          Rose are seated at a table.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           You can't ? ... At all ?...

Right ?\r\n                         \r\n          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front\r\n          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's\r\n          back.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What is that ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Well, I haven't asked you what you do.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           That's right.

While\r\n          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the\r\n          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress\r\n          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her\r\n          thigh.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE OF THE VALET\r\n                         VOICE OVER\r\n           Cab's here !

The tracking shot moves on to a\r\n          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a\r\n          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.\r\n          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.\r\n          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.\r\n                         \r\n           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n           Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father\r\n           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having\r\n           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to\r\n           continue ? Let me know, okay ?\r\n                         \r\n          A click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot\r\n          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head\r\n          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to\r\n          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting\r\n          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman\r\n          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another\r\n          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of\r\n          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a\r\n          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where\r\n          a dumbbell is resting.\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           I think I want to continue.\r\n          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only\r\n          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.\r\n           You bitch !\r\n          Another whip crack.\r\n           I called you a bitch !\r\n          Whip crack.\r\n           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\r\n          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a\r\n          larger angle.\r\n           Oh!\r\n          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.\r\n           Oh! I'm sorry.\r\n          Almost hysterical laugh.\r\n                         \r\n          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,\r\n          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly\r\n          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when\r\n          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back\r\n          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled\r\n          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,\r\n          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its\r\n          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated\r\n          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in\r\n          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.\r\n           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked\r\n          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely\r\n          avoid driving on Bill.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          Yelling to the driver.\r\n           Hey !\r\n                         \r\n          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes\r\n          very close to Bill.\r\n                         \r\n                          THE DRIVER\r\n           You idiot !\r\n                         \r\n          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing\r\n          dead leaves on the bank of the road.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power\r\n          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his\r\n          work.\r\n           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !\r\n          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He\r\n          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.\r\n           Fuck !\r\n          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.\r\n           Hello !\r\n          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall\r\n          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the\r\n          road.\r\n           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck\r\n           with me !\r\n          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks\r\n          at the envelopes.\r\n           Fuckin' bill. Great.\r\n                         \r\n          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the\r\n          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter\r\n          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face\r\n          Hector.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Capa !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He comes back to the car. He looks very angry.\r\n           Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a\r\n           cop !

They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes\r\n          her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose\r\n          tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his\r\n          ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis.\r\n           Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists.\r\n          Bill is kissing Rose's breasts.\r\n           Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's\r\n          legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic\r\n          hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her\r\n          stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily.\r\n           Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of\r\n          the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to\r\n          their waists.\r\n           Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down\r\n          his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view\r\n          of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to\r\n          avoid being X-rated).\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Multiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the\r\n          \u00abpiece of art\u00bb.

They are sweating profusely. Their\r\n          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,\r\n          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying\r\n          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very\r\n          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.\r\n           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an\r\n          orgasm.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          Still holding the bedposts.

In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose\r\n          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the\r\n          other side of the table.\r\n           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.\r\n           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see\r\n          that Rose is naked.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           You're not eating.

On\r\n          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked\r\n          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The\r\n          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another\r\n          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.\r\n                         \r\n                          THE ARCHIVIST\r\n           It's a miracle. I found it.\r\n          She starts walking between two rows of shelves.

Kids were put under care, let's see,\r\n           about six years ago.\r\n                          BILL\r\n          He tries to read above her shoulder.\r\n           Does it say why?\r\n                         \r\n                          THE ARCHIVIST\r\n           Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...\r\n          She flips a page in the file.\r\n           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie\r\n           was 12.\r\n          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist\r\n          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.\r\n           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple\r\n           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until\r\n           recently.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What do you mean, \"lost track\" of them?\r\n                         \r\n                          THE ARCHIVIST\r\n          She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of\r\n          shelves, followed by Bill.\r\n           Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.\r\n           Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children\r\n           of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and\r\n           there's two more down the hall.\r\n                         \r\n          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of\r\n          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an\r\n          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the\r\n          bed, a small upholstered bench.\r\n           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,\r\n          which they throw on the bed.\r\n                         \r\n                          BONNIE\r\n           Nobody's like your ex-husband!\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           That's for sure. That's for sure.\r\n          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.\r\n           Okay, okay, okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          BONNIE\r\n          She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see\r\n          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different\r\n          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.\r\n           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it\r\n           great ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           I know. It's incredible.

Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.\r\n           I think I should have got it in green or something.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh ! Oh ! Lush !\r\n          She has put the white dress on.\r\n           What do you think?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She seems very moved.\r\n           I think... you look beautiful.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           You sure ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Oh, yeah.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Come zip me up.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Okay. Okay.\r\n          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.\r\n           Oh, this is so tight.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           I need to find a new husband.\r\n          They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking\r\n          through the parcels.\r\n           I need some more money.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings\r\n           anywhere ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face.\r\n           Yes, I've got them.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh, sweet !\r\n          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by\r\n          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.\r\n           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           They're so gorgeous, yes.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Try yours on.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of\r\n          undressing in front of her friend.\r\n           Okay.\r\n          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her\r\n          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks\r\n          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at\r\n          her without really understanding what's going on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           What now ?

Rose starts laughing.\r\n           You better get that.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She takes the phone.\r\n           Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um...

Yeah. You\r\n           are? Okay !...\r\n          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's\r\n          car in the street.\r\n           Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay.

Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did\r\n           you know that he was... molested as a child ?\r\n          She has tears in her eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No, I didn't know that.\r\n          He comes back to her.\r\n           It's sticking out all over.\r\n          He sits on the bench of the piano.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           It's fashionable.\r\n          She laughs nervously.\r\n           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a\r\n           book, go on Oprah.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie\r\n           has a violent streak ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She sighs.\r\n           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.\r\n           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...\r\n          She gets up.\r\n           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while\r\n           pretending to help your patients ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You really think that I don't care about Richie ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She gets upset.\r\n           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at\r\n           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who\r\n           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Clark ?\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n          She gets more and more upset.\r\n           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son\r\n           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I\r\n           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on\r\n           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...\r\n           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And\r\n           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over\r\n           again.\r\n          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without\r\n          reacting.\r\n           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes\r\n          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.\r\n           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.\r\n           Wow ! That's my trainer.\r\n          She gets up and sniffs a bit.\r\n           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.\r\n          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young\r\n          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.\r\n           This is my trainer, Chris.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hi.\r\n          Chris just nods his head.\r\n           Bye-bye.\r\n          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally\r\n          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           I don't feel like lifting weights today.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHRIS\r\n           Okay.\r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Let's do something else.\r\n          She bursts laughing.\r\n           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the\r\n          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !\r\n                         \r\n          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a\r\n          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory\r\n          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very\r\n          high chimney above the building.\r\n           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the\r\n          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that\r\n          indicates the location of the \u00aboffice\u00bb. He knocks at a door with a\r\n          window and a grating and a sign that says \u00abbeware of the dog\u00bb. The\r\n          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through\r\n          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.\r\n           Bill comes back the way he came toward the \u00aboffice\u00bb. He stops in\r\n          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He\r\n          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick\r\n          glimpse of someone behind the window.\r\n           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men\r\n          are unloading.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?\r\n                         \r\n          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.\r\n                         \r\n          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He\r\n          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and\r\n          gets in.\r\n           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.\r\n          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted \u00aboffice\u00bb)\r\n          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to\r\n          watch Bill.\r\n           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.\r\n          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.\r\n           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are\r\n          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,\r\n          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Excuse me.\r\n                         \r\n          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He\r\n          raises his mask : It's Dale.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Hello. Did you go to the house?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...\r\n          Dale shuts his blowtorch off.\r\n           I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone\r\n           number in our file.\r\n                          DALE\r\n          He takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.\r\n           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another\r\n           psychiatrist ?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           No. No, we moved.\r\n          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.\r\n           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I\r\n           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on\r\n           the brink.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at\r\n          Bill.\r\n           A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they\r\n           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain\r\n           is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What's the bullet ?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Whatever it was, I got him away.\r\n          He has taken protection glasses to work.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You want to talk about that ?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let\r\n           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's\r\n           gonna blow up in your face.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You think he's violent ?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Not with me.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I think you're making a mistake, Dale.

He is wearing light-colored pants, a\r\n          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps\r\n          toward the house.\r\n           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door\r\n          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the\r\n          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.\r\n           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face\r\n          appears.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Mrs. Niedelmeyer?\r\n                         \r\n                          EDITH\r\n           Yes.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hi, I'm Bill Capa.

And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I\r\n           don't know what to do about that.\r\n          He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Do you think she loves you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           No. No.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Do you care, Casey ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           I don't know.

You want to share something, share the ashtray.\r\n          He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on\r\n          it.\r\n           I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's\r\n           young. Auburn hair, 5'5\", 105. Pretty as hell.

It's like she's running through\r\n           my fingers. Two people I loved died.

Medical leave.\r\n          He puts his glasses on.\r\n           \"Just please, please don't come back.\"\r\n          He sits down and sighs.\r\n           I do apologize for my outburst in group.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?\r\n                         \r\n                          CLARK\r\n          He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start\r\n          walking in the room.\r\n           I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra\r\n           is... A very warmhearted woman, but...\r\n          While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants.\r\n           Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without\r\n           cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.\r\n           Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman\r\n           used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the\r\n           shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There\r\n           were 22 items I couldn't take.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to\r\n           your keen sense of order.\r\n                         \r\n                          CLARK\r\n           I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.\r\n           She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except\r\n           for the faint smell of perfume.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          Bill sneers.\r\n           Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?\r\n                          CLARK\r\n           Take a look at this.\r\n          He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags\r\n          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.\r\n           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was\r\n           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next\r\n           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm\r\n           terrified to go near the woman.\r\n                         \r\n          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is\r\n          ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is\r\n          wearing sunglasses.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.\r\n                         \r\n           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE\r\n          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.\r\n           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the\r\n           red car.\r\n          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his\r\n          right.\r\n           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.\r\n           Shithead Capa.\r\n          Strange sounding giggles.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?\r\n                         \r\n           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE\r\n           Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my\r\n           scalpel, Doctor.\r\n                         \r\n          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red\r\n          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him\r\n          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Goddamn it !\r\n                         \r\n          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its\r\n          radiator grill.\r\n           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road\r\n          downtown.\r\n           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of\r\n          honking.\r\n           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and\r\n          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous\r\n          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on\r\n          following him.\r\n           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and\r\n          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the\r\n          pavement.\r\n           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches\r\n          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car\r\n          right side.\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Fuck you !\r\n          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.\r\n           Fuck you!\r\n          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.\r\n          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close\r\n          to the curb as possible.\r\n           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...\r\n          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open\r\n          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of\r\n          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her\r\n          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump\r\n          again into each other and arrive into a main road.\r\n           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on\r\n          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The\r\n          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on\r\n          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.\r\n          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and\r\n          causes a pile-up on the road.\r\n           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a\r\n          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.\r\n          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then\r\n          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and\r\n          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the\r\n          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.\r\n           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?\r\n          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and\r\n          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.\r\n           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car\r\n          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.\r\n           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.\r\n          We see the train moving behind him.\r\n                         \r\n          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two\r\n          hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see\r\n          Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on\r\n          his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose.\r\n           There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others\r\n          drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored\r\n          bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on\r\n          playing.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey !\r\n          He kisses a passing Mexican woman.\r\n           ? Como esta? Gracias.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car\r\n           wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a\r\n           spooky feeling.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really\r\n           something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !\r\n          He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we\r\n          see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The\r\n          puppet is dressed in a cop's costume !\r\n          Hector and Bill come to the buffet table.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He gets a notebook from his pocket.\r\n           You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday\r\n           group ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.\r\n          He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from\r\n          the buffet.\r\n           Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in\r\n           intensive care.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a\r\n           fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands\r\n           died of unnatural causes.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Probably lost some body fluids.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for\r\n           drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the\r\n           house on fire. So what do you think of that ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.\r\n                         \r\n          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the\r\n          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a\r\n          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.\r\n                         \r\n                          THE VOICE\r\n           Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up\r\n           and your legs spread !\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           What the hell is this ?\r\n                         \r\n          We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight.\r\n                         \r\n                          THE VOICE\r\n           Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We\r\n           got something for you !\r\n                         \r\n          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word \u00abpolice\u00bb is\r\n          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the\r\n          right skid. One has a megaphone.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICES OF THE COPS\r\n           Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !\r\n          The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra.\r\n                         \r\n                          THE CROWD\r\n           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good\r\n           fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !\r\n          Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up.\r\n           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !\r\n          People yell and whistle.\r\n                         \r\n          One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets\r\n          her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop,\r\n          on the other skid, has another megaphone.\r\n           People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by\r\n           tomorrow.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Me too.\r\n                         \r\n          The helicopter flies away.\r\n           Large shot on the orchestra singing.\r\n                         \r\n                          ORCHESTRA\r\n           Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.\r\n                         \r\n          In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly.\r\n          Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two\r\n          men get up to find a shelter.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.\r\n           Ivengan a buscar el cake !\r\n                         \r\n          People stop dancing and run to find a shelter.\r\n                          A MAN\r\n           Everybody inside !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           How come you didn't mention Buck ?\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           There wasn't anything on him.\r\n                         \r\n          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the\r\n          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red\r\n          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car\r\n          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket\r\n          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes\r\n          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill\r\n          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops\r\n          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters\r\n          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after\r\n          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns\r\n          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.\r\n                          BUCK\r\n           You caught me at a bad time.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Can we get in out of the rain?\r\n                         \r\n          Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill\r\n          starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house.\r\n                         \r\n          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights\r\n          and a unique lamp above the desk.\r\n           Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and\r\n          practical.\r\n           We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.\r\n                         \r\n                          BUCK\r\n           Have a seat.\r\n                         \r\n          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and\r\n          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill\r\n          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan\r\n          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's\r\n          hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I don't like guns.\r\n                         \r\n          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of\r\n          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill\r\n          takes his jacket off.\r\n           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light.

We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy\r\n           comes out wavin', \"Stop!\" So I slow down. My wife said,\r\n           \"No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the\r\n           baby's asleep in the back.\" And I said, \"Bad neighborhood,\r\n           nothing.\" So I stopped. Never even made it to the other\r\n           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes\r\n           wouldn't open. L...\r\n          Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head.\r\n           Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy\r\n           rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull\r\n           my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head\r\n           for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my\r\n           daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They\r\n           got $31.

He shuts his car door, and walks\r\n          quietly toward the house. He looks around him in the garden,\r\n          seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house.\r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Still anxious, Bill walks along the corridor.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on\r\n          the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling\r\n          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Hey.\r\n          She snickers.

He looks shocked.\r\n           No ? Okay.\r\n          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her\r\n          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is\r\n          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on\r\n          her buttocks.\r\n           Oh!

Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in\r\n          her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose\r\n          bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass\r\n          table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her\r\n          other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her\r\n          chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides\r\n          completely out of her chair and under the table.\r\n                         \r\n          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs.

Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.\r\n          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing\r\n          on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's\r\n          naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub.\r\n           Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem.

Was there an investigation ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANDERSON\r\n           Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a\r\n           suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck\r\n           forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What do you think ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANDERSON\r\n           I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the\r\n           street. This was just payback\r\n           for both of 'em.\r\n          They have come to a fishmonger stall. The fishmonger wraps a fish\r\n          for Anderson.\r\n                         \r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Casey is lying on an exercise bench and lifting weight with a\r\n          pulleys and cables device.\r\n           The phone rings.

Can't get to the phone right now, but\r\n           please leave a message.\r\n          A beep, then Bill's voice.\r\n                         \r\n           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n           Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can\r\n           make it today. Are you there ?\r\n                         \r\n          A hand appears holding a leather collar, which the hand wraps\r\n          around Casey's neck.\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?\r\n                         \r\n           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n           Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just\r\n           hang in there, okay ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           Let me get this, huh ? No ?\r\n                         \r\n           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n           I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30.\r\n                         \r\n                          CASEY\r\n           Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?\r\n                         \r\n          He snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck.\r\n                         \r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing\r\n          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,\r\n          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is\r\n          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read\r\n          \u00abNate Starkman & Son\u00bb on the front of the building.\r\n           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom\r\n          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above\r\n          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of\r\n          the building.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He yells.\r\n           Casey !\r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are\r\n          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He\r\n          groans through the gag.\r\n                         \r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder.\r\n           Casey !\r\n                         \r\n          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several\r\n          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He\r\n          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of\r\n          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches\r\n          the ladder, which he brings down.\r\n                         \r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort\r\n          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern\r\n          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a\r\n          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,\r\n          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of\r\n          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along\r\n          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Oh, Jesus Christ.\r\n          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke\r\n          gets out of it.\r\n           Casey ! Hey !\r\n          He walks through the open window.\r\n           Casey!\r\n                         \r\n          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes\r\n          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He\r\n          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.\r\n           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are\r\n          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put\r\n          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and\r\n          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.\r\n           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,\r\n          flooding the room with bright light.\r\n           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings\r\n          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair\r\n          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the\r\n          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought\r\n          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from\r\n          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a\r\n          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.\r\n           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on\r\n          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this\r\n          slimy liquid.\r\n           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable\r\n          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the\r\n          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead\r\n          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is\r\n          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's\r\n          blood.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns\r\n          red.\r\n                         \r\n          A ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Sondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat,\r\n          with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a\r\n          song.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           I love this song.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           I know.\r\n                         \r\n          Honking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car.\r\n                         \r\n           THE RED CAR PASSENGER\r\n           You girls want to go dancing ?\r\n                         \r\n           THE RED CAR DRIVER\r\n           Yeah. We're going to a party.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Hi ! Hi !...\r\n                         \r\n          Rose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly.\r\n                         \r\n           THE RED CAR PASSENGER\r\n           Well, pardon me !\r\n          The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away.\r\n          The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof\r\n          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and\r\n          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           What are you doing ?\r\n          Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her\r\n          crotch.\r\n           Wha... No!\r\n          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on\r\n          cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving.\r\n           Don't ! Don't !\r\n                         \r\n          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The\r\n          two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a\r\n          tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which\r\n          shows her belly.\r\n                          SONG WORDS\r\n           Out all night Lady did.

In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing.\r\n          The music stops.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Sondra, come here. Oh, come here.

Sondra strokes Rose's\r\n          naked stomach, then her face.\r\n           Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,\r\n          between the girls legs.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !\r\n                         \r\n          The camera remains on the mirror, which shows the two girls\r\n          climbing on the bed to get a better look.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Oh, what are they doing now ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           I can't tell.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Are they gonna do it ? No !\r\n                         \r\n          We see the couple in the house across the street. She is only\r\n          wearing panties and her breast is naked. He is only wearing his\r\n          trunks. They flirt on the couch.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           My God ! It's gonna happen right now.\r\n                         \r\n          Back to the mirror shot. The two girls, still standing up, are\r\n          slapping each other buttocks. Rose raises Sondra's dress.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Ow !\r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\r\n          She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass.\r\n           Oh, champagne.\r\n                         \r\n          Sondra comes and sits next to her. Rose gives her her glass.\r\n          Sondra drinks.\r\n                         \r\n                          SONDRA\r\n           Mmm.\r\n                         \r\n          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.\r\n          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging\r\n          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and\r\n          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved\r\n          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face.

He start looking for another\r\n          album.\r\n           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except\r\n           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which\r\n           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead\r\n           as they were pretending.\r\n          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.\r\n           I don't know who these people are.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          She seems very worried all of a sudden.\r\n           No. It's morbid.

He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a\r\n          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it\r\n          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him.

It is a photo of Rose\r\n          naked.\r\n           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and\r\n           that's why I lost my temper.

He is wearing sunglasses.\r\n           As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the\r\n          \u00abred car\u00bb, also dented all over. It starts following Bill.\r\n           Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking\r\n          building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building.\r\n           Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the\r\n          car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following\r\n          him from the roof.\r\n           The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,\r\n          then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and\r\n          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car\r\n          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just\r\n          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.\r\n          We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken\r\n          guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of\r\n          broken cars are flying all around him.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He yells.\r\n           Damn !\r\n                         \r\n          BUILDING WITH GALLERIES - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries. On\r\n          one of the galleries, Anderson walks toward Hector who is pointing\r\n          a menacing finger to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           I ought to shoot you!\r\n                         \r\n                          ANDERSON\r\n           I came to make amends.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           So make 'em, loudmouth !\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the building. Very typical L.A. architecture, looking\r\n          almost like a movie set. Anderson and Hector are leaning against\r\n          the bannister of one of the upper galleries.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANDERSON\r\n           I just spoke to Bill Capa.

Anderson gives to Hector the\r\n          piece of paper Bill had given to him. Hector reads the paper.\r\n                         \r\n          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Bill runs to the door of the house.

Several heavy blows on the door,\r\n          which eventually crashes open and gives access to Bill.\r\n           The house is very heavily decorated.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I need you to listen to me !

She\r\n          leans against the frame of the door.\r\n           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I\r\n           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What about the family ?\r\n                          EDITH\r\n           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were\r\n           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,\r\n           Rose.\r\n                         \r\n          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the\r\n          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a\r\n          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling\r\n          its tongue out.\r\n                         \r\n          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's\r\n          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than\r\n          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly\r\n          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the\r\n          first floor of the building.\r\n           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car\r\n          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the\r\n          sign \u00abBeware of dog\u00bb.\r\n                         \r\n          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.\r\n          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred\r\n          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..\r\n           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.\r\n                         \r\n          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small\r\n          cage hanging from the ceiling.\r\n           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with\r\n          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill\r\n          raises his head.\r\n           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.\r\n           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood\r\n          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the\r\n          workshop.\r\n           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the\r\n          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with\r\n          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Richie.\r\n          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.\r\n           Jesus Christ !\r\n          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn\r\n          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts\r\n          moaning. Bill kneels near him.\r\n           What did he... What did he do to you ?\r\n                         \r\n                          RICHIE\r\n          He can hardly talk, and stammers even more than usual.\r\n           W-What I... d-deserved.

I need to know.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,\r\n           \"Richie, come here.\" And I told him, I told him, \"My name\r\n           is Rose !\" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And\r\n           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did\r\n           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I\r\n           was Richie from then on.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What happened to Rose ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           And you had to come to group.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           They were our world. They were our family.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           But then what ? Rose started coming back ?\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie\r\n           was first.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Oh, honey.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Help me, please ! Help me.\r\n          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers\r\n          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the\r\n          armchair.\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Jesus! Oh, my God !\r\n          Bill stands up.\r\n           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !\r\n          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and\r\n          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.\r\n           That crazy bastard !\r\n          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          She cries and yells.\r\n           Oh, God !\r\n                         \r\n          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are\r\n          rolling upwards.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He feels that she is going away from him.\r\n           Rose !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering\r\n          again.\r\n           Get away f-from me!\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          Still talking like Richie.\r\n           I never get to be out a-anymore.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Rose. Come on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose.\r\n           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.\r\n          Bill takes off the other nail.\r\n           It did. It did.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           I know. Come on, let's go.\r\n          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.\r\n           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.\r\n          They start going down to the workshop.\r\n           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of\r\n          metal near them.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh !\r\n                         \r\n          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various\r\n          wooden objects around them.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n          Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting\r\n          nails.\r\n           Back up!\r\n          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a\r\n          carved wooden panel.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          She yells and holds Bill tightly.\r\n           No ! No, Dale, don't !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Get back ! Get back !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Dale, no !\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.\r\n          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through\r\n          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.\r\n           Deadly.\r\n                         \r\n          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a\r\n          wall, holding a \u00abreal\u00bb gun.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it\r\n           in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What are you doing here, Martinez ?\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes\r\n          away from Dale.\r\n           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !\r\n           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let\r\n           that be your psych lesson for the day !\r\n                         \r\n          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward\r\n          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little\r\n          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is\r\n          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood\r\n          panel.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n          He yells.\r\n           Go ! Run !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           No ! No !\r\n                         \r\n          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's\r\n          fingers.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR\r\n           Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !\r\n          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with\r\n          Rose.\r\n           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,\r\n          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in\r\n          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on\r\n          the controls of a handling machine.\r\n           Bill moves Rose away from him...\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Let's go!\r\n                         \r\n          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls\r\n          down, stuck under the furniture.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           No ! Get out !\r\n                         \r\n          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his\r\n          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the\r\n          belt across the workshop.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Come on ! Come on !\r\n                         \r\n          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of\r\n          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from\r\n          his throat.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You fucking son of a bitch !\r\n          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on\r\n          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.\r\n           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little\r\n           brother killed.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           No !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           No, I saved him !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           You knew what was happening...\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           I didn't know !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Because it happened to you before !\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Would you goddamn shut up ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed\r\n           himself.\r\n                          DALE\r\n          He is getting angry.\r\n           Shut up !

And you made Rose become Richie !\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n          He calms down and smiles.\r\n           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,\r\n           but I put a stop to that.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Yeah, you did.\r\n          He coughs.\r\n           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't\r\n           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and\r\n           pushin'. Huh ?\r\n          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Why'd you do it, Dale ?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking\r\n           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after\r\n           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...\r\n           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed\r\n           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.\r\n           - And now...\r\n          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.\r\n           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He snickers.\r\n           The inspiration of madness, Dale.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.\r\n                         \r\n          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We\r\n          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's\r\n          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,\r\n          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALE\r\n           Richie.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           My name is... My name is Rose.\r\n          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of\r\n          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.\r\n           No ! No !\r\n          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to\r\n          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She\r\n          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.\r\n           No !\r\n          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has\r\n          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.\r\n           No !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He runs after her.\r\n           Rose ! Rose ! Come back !

Bill follows her and yells.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Rose ! Rose ! Stop !

Thunder\r\n          is rumbling.\r\n           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill\r\n          climbing on it.\r\n           Wait !

Stop !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n          He reaches the platform.\r\n           No ! No. No !\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Wait !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Why ?\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !\r\n          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.\r\n           Just stay there !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Why would you do that ?\r\n                          BILL\r\n           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.\r\n           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in\r\n           dying. Come on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Oh, Capa.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Come on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound\r\n          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts\r\n          falling backward.\r\n           L... No...\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           No !\r\n                         \r\n                          ROSE\r\n           Capa !\r\n          She yells.\r\n           No !\r\n                         \r\n          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the\r\n          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm\r\n          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he\r\n          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They\r\n          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,\r\n          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           Come on.\r\n                         \r\n          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,\r\n          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the\r\n          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is\r\n          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even\r\n          more tightly.\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR'S VOICE\r\n          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole\r\n          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's\r\n          voice.\r\n           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me\r\n           hanging here all night, huh ?\r\n          Bill starts laughing.\r\n           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking\r\n           Band-Aids !\r\n          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.\r\n           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !\r\n                         \r\n                         CREDITS\r\n                         \r\n          During the credits, we hear the following song :\r\n                         \r\n           WORDS OF THE CREDITS SONG\r\n           You and I - Moving in the dark - Bodies close But souls\r\n           apart - Shadowed smiles - Secrets unrevealed - I need to\r\n           know The way you feel - And I'll give you everything I am\r\n           And everything I want to be - I'll put it in your hands -\r\n           If you could open up to me - Oh, can't we ever Get beyond\r\n           this wall 'Cause all I want Is just once To see you in the\r\n           light - But you hide behind The color of the night - Ooh,\r\n           ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - God save me - Ooh, ooh, ooh\r\n           Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh - Everything I am -\r\n           Everything I am - And everything I want to be - Oh, can't\r\n           we ever get beyond this wall 'Cause all I want Is just once\r\n           - Forever and again - Ever and again - I'm waiting for you\r\n           - I'm standing in the night But you hide behind The color\r\n           of The night - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - Please come\r\n           out from the color of The night\r\n                         \r\n                          HECTOR'S VOICE\r\n          At the end of the credits, we hear Hector's voice again.\r\n           Hey !
