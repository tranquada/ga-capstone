RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)\n</b>\n               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-\n               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty \n               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She \n               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus \n               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, \n               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the \n               b.g., which she hums along with.\n\n<b>               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n</b>\n               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming \n               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, \n               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left \n               from last night's dinner which had to \"soak\".  She is still \n               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.\n\n               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering \n               project going on in the dining room, an obvious \"do-it-\n               yourself\" attempt by Thelma.\n\n<b>               INT.

We see various recipes torn out \n               from women's magazines along the lines of \"101 Ways to Cook \n               Pork.\"\n\n<b>                                     THELMA\n</b>                         He already thinks you're out of your \n                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much \n                         weight with Darryl.

Honey, you'd better hurry \n                         up.\n\n               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made \n               for this man, and he's dripping in \"men's\" jewelry.  He \n               manages a Carpeteria.\n\n<b>                                     DARRYL\n</b>                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like \n                         that!

He exudes over-confidence \n               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think \n               of himself as a real lady killer.\n\n               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed \n               hair.

REVEAL Thelma, standing \n               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, \n               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was \n               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.\n\n<b>               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY\n</b>\n               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and \n               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long \n               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, \n               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.\n\n               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.\n\n               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, \n               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take \n               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the \n               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.

Her attitude is \n               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's \n               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision \n               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking \n               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there \n               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It \n               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up \n               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.\n\n<b>                                     THELMA\n</b>                              (muttering to herself)\n                         Psycho killers...\n\n               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She \n               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out \n               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and \n               heaves all her weight against the top.\n\n<b>               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway \n               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is \n               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that \n               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a \n               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in \n               there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.\n\n<b>                                     LOUISE\n</b>                         We don't need the lantern.

The trunk barely closes.  \n               Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the \n               car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the \n               street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.\n\n               She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the \n               air.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She tests the weight of it, and \n               then puts it under the seat.
