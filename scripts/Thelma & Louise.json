RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)\n\n               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-\n               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty \n               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She \n               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus \n               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, \n               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the \n               b.g., which she hums along with.\n\n               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming \n               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, \n               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left \n               from last night's dinner which had to \"soak\".  She is still \n               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.\n\n               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering \n               project going on in the dining room, an obvious \"do-it-\n               yourself\" attempt by Thelma.\n\n               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING\n\n               Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.\n\n               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n               Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (hollering)\n                         I got it!   Hello.\n\n               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                              (at pay phone)\n                         I hope you're packed, little \n                         housewife, 'cause we are outta her \n                         tonight.\n\n               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Well, wait now.  I still have to ask \n                         Darryl if I can go.\n\n                                     LOUISE (V.O.)\n                         You mean you haven't asked him yet?  \n                         For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your \n                         husband or your father?  It's just \n                         two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.  \n                         Don't be a child.  Just tell him \n                         you're goin' with me, for cryin' out \n                         loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous \n                         breakdown.\n\n               Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out \n               coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board \n               already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out \n               from women's magazines along the lines of \"101 Ways to Cook \n               Pork.\"\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         He already thinks you're out of your \n                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much \n                         weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?\n\n                                     LOUISE (V.O.)\n                         No, I'm callin' from the Playboy \n                         Mansion.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         I'll call you right back.\n\n               Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the \n               stairs and leans on the banister.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry \n                         up.\n\n               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made \n               for this man, and he's dripping in \"men's\" jewelry.  He \n               manages a Carpeteria.\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like \n                         that!  Haven't I told you I can't \n                         stand it when you holler in the \n                         morning.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want \n                         you to be late.\n\n               Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and\n\n               it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence \n               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think \n               of himself as a real lady killer.\n\n               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed \n               hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Hon.\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         What.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (she decides not to \n                              tell him)\n                         Have a good day at work today.\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Hon?\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         What?!\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         You want anything special for dinner?\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what \n                         we have for dinner.  I may not even \n                         make it home for dinner.  You know \n                         how Fridays are.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Funny how so many people wanna buy \n                         carpet on a Friday night.  You'd \n                         almost think they's want to forget \n                         about it for the weekend.\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         Well then, it's a good thing you're \n                         not regional manager and I am.\n\n               He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma \n               the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.\n\n                                     DARRYL\n                         See ya.\n\n               Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he \n               closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         He's gonna shit.\n\n               Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen \n               and picks up the phone and dials it.\n\n               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING\n\n               The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his \n               50's, answers.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is \n                         this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you \n                         gonna run away with me?\n\n               Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                              (to Albert)\n                         Not this weekend, sweetie, she's \n                         runnin' away with me.\n                              (into phone)\n                         Hi.  What'd he say?\n\n                                     THELMA (V.O.)\n                         What time are you gonna pick me up?\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be \n                         there around two or three.\n\n                                     THELMA (V.O.)\n                         What kind of stuff do I bring?\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess.  \n                         It's the mountains.  I guess it gets \n                         cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring \n                         everything.\n\n                                     THELMA (V.O.)\n                         Okay.  I will, too.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.\n\n                                     THELMA (V.O.)\n                         I don't know how to fish, Louise.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl \n                         does it, how hard can it be?  I'll \n                         see you later.  Be ready.\n\n               They both hang up.\n\n               EXT.  RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n               Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.\n\n               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY\n\n               Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel \n               pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way \n               too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing \n               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, \n               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was \n               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.\n\n               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY\n\n               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and \n               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long \n               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, \n               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.\n\n               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.\n\n               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, \n               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take \n               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the \n               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We \n               hear:\n\n                                     ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)\n                         Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here \n                         right now, but I'll probably be back \n                         'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave \n                         a message.\n\n               Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and \n               Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of-\n               factly slams that face down, too.\n\n               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks \n               to herself quietly the whole time.\n\n               She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, \n               fingernail scissors, etc.\n\n               She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is \n               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's \n               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision \n               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking \n               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there \n               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It \n               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up \n               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (muttering to herself)\n                         Psycho killers...\n\n               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She \n               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out \n               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and \n               heaves all her weight against the top.\n\n               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway \n               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is \n               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that \n               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a \n               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in \n               there, too.

The Waitress \n               sees her and nods.  She turns back to face her friend.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Givin' him a taste of his own \n                         medicine.

She smiles and waves at him.\n\n               Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Jimmy'll come in off the road, you \n                         won't be there, he'll freak out and \n                         call you a hundred thousand times, \n                         and Sunday night you'll call him \n                         back and, by Monday.  He'll be kissin' \n                         the ground you walk on.\n\n               Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at \n               which she speaks can be staggering.  Louise is used to it.  \n               Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the \n               situation.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Exactly.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         In the meantime, you said we were \n                         gonna have some fun.  So let's have \n                         some!\n\n               She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up \n               her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.\n\n               Practically the whole place \"whoops\" and heads for the dance \n               floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her \n               glass, too.\n\n               LATER\n\n               Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.  \n               Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma \n               is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in \n               one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan \n               is studying her closely.  Louise notices this.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                              (over the noise)\n                         Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little \n                         girls' room, and then we gotta hit \n                         the road.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (eyes closed, swaying \n                              with the music)\n                         Ready when you are.\n\n               Louise heads off to the bathroom.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (eyes still closed)\n                         Louise, I'm gonna come with you.\n                              (she gets a funny \n                              look on her face)\n                         I don't feel so good.\n\n               She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.\n\n               Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a \n               line of at least fifteen women in front of her.\n\n                                     HARLAN\n                              (catching Thelma, \n                              copping feels)\n                         Oopsy-doopsy.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is \n               wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but \n               he's right back in there.\n\n                                     HARLAN\n                         How you feelin' now, darlin'?\n\n               Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her \n               head away.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         I guess I'm startin' to feel a little \n                         better.\n\n                                     HARLAN\n                         Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty \n                         good to me, too.\n\n               He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.  \n               Thelma pulls away.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (uncomfortable)\n                         I think I need to keep walking.\n\n               INT.

She doesn't see her.  \n               She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.  \n               She picks up the check and looks at it.\n\n               EXT.

He lets go of her face and pins her \n               arms behind her.  He holds both of her arms with one hand.\n\n                                     HARLAN\n                         You just shut up.\n\n               With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her \n               dress up.

He holds both her arms in one hand and continues \n               pulling her dress up over her hips.  He starts to undo his \n               pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.\n\n                                     LOUISE (O.S.)\n                         Let her go.\n\n                                     HARLAN\n                         Get lost.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Louise!\n\n               TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into \n               the nape of Harlan's neck.

She is still \n               backing away with the gun raised.  Thelma is inching away as \n               well.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Just for the future, when a woman's \n                         crying like that, she's not having \n                         any fun!\n\n               Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.

We hear his body HIT \n               the gravel parking lot.  LOUISE'S POV.  The car behind him \n               is splattered with blood.  Thelma and Louise are both silent.  \n               We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance.

As they speed out of the \n               parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the \n               nightclub.

She stops when she gets \n               to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in \n               the car and moves over to the passenger side.

THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Phone RINGS.\n\n               VARIOUS SHOTS of the interior of the empty Dickinson house:\n\n               THE BEDROOM\n\n               exactly as Thelma left it.  The drawer of the nightstand \n               still open.\n\n               THE NOTE TO DARRYL\n\n               taped to the refrigerator.  The interior of the microwave \n               with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the \n               package in a little puddle.\n\n               INT.

As the door closes \n               behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and \n               starts putting it into the phone.  She dials a number.  It \n               RINGS for a long time.  She hangs up and goes into the \n               bathroom.  She looks at herself in the mirror.\n\n               She notices a tiny speck on her cheek.  She takes a paper \n               towel and wets it and rubs the spot.  She looks at the towel \n               and there is a bright red streak.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Thelma... Come on, Thelma!\n\n               The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging \n               out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at \n               Louise.  Louise charges out after her.  They head out of the \n               restaurant and, THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them get into the \n               car and drive away.\n\n               EXT.

We'll get a motel room.  I \n                         can rest for a while and then figure \n                         out how to get some money.  We're \n                         gonna need money.

Let me \n                         look.\n\n               Thelma is rummaging through her purse.  She finds her wallet \n               and takes it out.  Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the \n               change compartment and takes them out.  She straightens the \n               money out.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Sixty-four dollars.\n\n               As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her \n               hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars.\n\n               Louise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her \n               driving.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         I'm cash poor.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Hmmm.

MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.)\n\n               The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right \n               outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at \n               the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting \n               things in drawers.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Why are you unpacking?

Hal looks closely at \n               the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of \n               hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints \n               so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His \n               face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear \n               drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood \n               splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician \n               over and points it out.\n\n                                     HAL\n                              (pointing)\n                         What's that?\n\n               The I.D.

Louise is really touched that \n               he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is \n               very kind to him.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Oh... now... it's probably not such \n                         a good idea right now.

He covers her hand with his.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         You keep this!\n\n               Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.  \n               A taxi pulls up outside.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Your taxi's here.\n\n               Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that \n               employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself \n               with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at \n               his watch.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         Are you happy, Louise?

Happy as I can \n                         be.\n\n               Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches \n               him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         Good thing he left when he did.

Louise \n               waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks \n               at her.  She smiles to herself.\n\n               INT.

It got messed up.\n\n               Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her \n               seat, barely able to contain herself.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         What's wrong with you?\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Nothing.

It's \n                         okay.\n\n               They are both leaving the restaurant now.

I don't believe it.\n\n               Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.  Thelma \n               comes and sits beside her.  Neither one says anything for a \n               moment.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Louise?

It's \n                         definitely not okay.  None of this \n                         is okay.  What are we going to do \n                         for money?

This causes Thelma to \n               leap into action.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                         Come on.  Stand up!

People livin' like \n                         Superman, all day and all night.  I \n                         won't say if it's wrong or I won't \n                         say if it's right.
