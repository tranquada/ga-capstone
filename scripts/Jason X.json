Death, destruction, fear.  All images \n\ttaken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  \n\n\tAGAIN, DARKNESS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPEN ON:\n\n\tThe year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a \n\thazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of \n\tdark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.\n\n\tBLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM \n\tbelow. \n\n\tSmall groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work \n\tnearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings \n\twith strange devices.\n\n\tThis is an archeological expedition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.  DARK PLACE\n\n\tThe dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small \n\tobject buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch \n\tand slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool \n\tto remove the dirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE\n\t\tCareful . . .\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE\n\t\tI know.\n\n\tThey take off their masks and goggles. They are both young.

A sign from the \n\tceiling states -\n\n\tCRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.\n\n\tThey all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists \n\tof DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming \n\tAZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; \n\tTHORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tAmazing! But, how . . I've been coming\n\t\there for ten years. We never picked this up on\n\t\tour . . . KAY-EM?\n\n\tKAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil.

Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled \n\tthrough the forehead by an iron spike. \n\n\tKKINSA SCREAMS!\n\n\tKicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as \n\n\tJANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! \n\n\tKAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.\n\n\t\t\t\tKAY-EM 14\n\t\tWas that out loud?\n\n\t\t\t\tDELONGPREE\n\t\tThorgan, have you been screwing with . . .\n\n\tTHORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHORGAN\n\t\tCool! This is an automatic \"A\".\n\n\tAzrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some \n\tcds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into \n\this pack.\n\t\t\t\tAZRAEL\n\t\tI've got my project.

I'm working on it.\n\t\tYou won't believe what we found.\n\t\t\t(calls out)\n\t\tAdrienne! Stoney!\n\n\tYllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass \n\tanother hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE \n\tFLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the \n\tbeginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOEMAN\n\t\tThere was a hall of a battle down here.\n\n\tS they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING \n\tVOICE sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMPUTER VOICE\n\t\tDan-danger. Do not enter-er.\n\n\tBut the group keeps moving. \n\n\t\t\t\tKKINSA\n\t\tI feel compelled to ask why we are\n\t\tignoring that.\n\n\tA corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a \n\twarning written in ancient blood . . .\n\n\tHELP ME . . .\n\n\tSuddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! \n\tEveryone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get \n\tthe corpse off her. \n\n\tDELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear \n\thysterical laughter and look up to see -\n\n\tADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing \n\tuncontrollably.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELONGPREE\n\t\tDamnit!\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tWhat the hell are you two doing?!\n\n\tKkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.\n\n\t\t\t\tKKINSA\n\t\tYou're toast, mister.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tYou're both toast!\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIENNE\n\t\tYou gotta see this!\n\n\tThey turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of \n\ta jumbled mess of jagged metal.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHORGAN\n\t\t\t(re: ceiling)\n\t\tThat's a strange design, don't you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tKICKER\n\t\tWe don't have time for this shit.\n\n\tAs they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and \n\tsqueeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .\n\n\tSTONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . \n\tCRYOGENICS LAB.\n\n\tAdrienne points to a small window in the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELONGPREE\n\t\tYeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIENNE\n\t\tCheck it out.\n\n\tWith a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in \n\tthe door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -\n\n\tA SKULL AND CROSSBONES \n\n\t\t\t\tKKINSA\n\t\tSo don't open the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIENNE\n\t\tLook beyond it, yesterday's news.\n\n\tYllo pushes his way to the window.\n\n\tShocked faces.\n\n\tINSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's \n\tmassive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled \n\tup into a ball, is a body - female, young.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tIs that?\n\n\t\t\t\tKAY-EM 14\n\t\tThe room's still operational.\n\t\tShe's perfectly preserved.\n\n\tYllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\t\t(into radio)\n\t\tFat Lou, bring the ship to the\n\t\tfollowing coordinates.

I don't think you\n\t\tshould open that door.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tThis is a science excursion corporal.\n\t\tJust stay out of the way.\n\n\tYllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tOkay, no screwing around. This is the real\n\t\tthing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, \n\t\topen it up.\n\n\tThorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.\n\n\t\t\t\tKKINSA\n\t\tYou're opening the door?\n\t\tWhat about the . . . ?\n\n\tShe points to the skull and crossbones. \n\n\t\t\t\tDELONGPREE\n\t\tI'm thinking we should call in some\n\t\texperts.\n\n\t\t\t\tYLLO\n\t\tThis is your find people.

The metallic door \n\tcracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes \n\twith the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas.
