He stops, glances at the clock, faces \n               the door, opens it, closes it. He paces, opens the door, \n               takes some deep breaths, twists his cheeks, then like a man \n               jumping into cold water, bolts out.\n\n               INT.

A bus squeals up to the curb, \n               belches smoke, then moves on. A garbage can is kicked over. \n               Bob starts to take a step when suddenly he gets dizzy. He \n               steps back and hyperventilates. Bob puts on a dust mask, \n               steps bravely onto the sidewalk, and walks, eyes fixed \n               forward.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel \n                         wonderful.\n                              (repeats)\n\n               A man passes Bob, eyes fixed forward.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I'll \n                         get you!\n                              (repeats)\n\n               EXT.

He walks in a straight line to the building \n               directory. He finds:\n\n                 \"Dr. Leo Marvin, A Psychiatric Corporation, suite 4616.\"\n\n                                     DOORMAN (O.S.)\n                         Help you?\n\n               This startles Bob but he recovers.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I'm going to see Dr. Leo Marvin.\n\n                                     DOORMAN\n                         Second elevator. 46th floor.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Elevator.

The elevator \n               arrives and the door opens. The elevator is filling up with \n               passengers. Bob doesn't move.\n\n               INT.

Under it he wears \n               a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         How do you know it's a death fixation? \n                         Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost \n                         childhood.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         What do you mean by that?\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         What do you mean by asking?\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Come on, get on the board and let's \n                         see your approach.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                              (striking a pose)\n                         My approach is to be suave and \n                         debonair and sophisticated.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like \n                         we learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.\n\n               Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together, \n               then takes a step with his right foot.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1, \n                         2, 3 fall.

He awkwardly takes two steps \n               then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water, \n               afraid to dive.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Why didn't you dive?\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         With all the horror that's going on \n                         in the world, what difference does \n                         it make?\n\n               INT. MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME\n\n               The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo \n               Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund \n               Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy, \n               Fay, and Leo. Anna is at the family stereo, selecting a CD. \n               Fay is on the chordless phone at the kitchen window, giving \n               milk to some stray cats.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (INTO PHONE)\n                         Of course I'm excited Ellie. The \n                         last person they interviewed on \n                         vacation was Dr Ruth.\n\n               Siggy enters and walks upstairs. Marvin enters and heads to \n               the living room chair. Fay hangs up.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         He didn't dive.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         No.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         He's a little afraid of it, dear. \n                         Have patience.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         It's not like I'm making him jump \n                         out of an airplane. When I was growing \n                         up, I thought diving was fun.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         I thought you were born grown up.\n\n               Marvin stares at Anna. She puts on raucous heavy metal.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         You're masking hostility, Anna Marvin. \n                         Turn that down.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         It's full of Freudian symbols, dad. \n                         It's educational.\n\n               Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair, \n               then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding \n               Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly. \n               Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window. \n               It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin \n               looks up and sees Bob.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         What the...?\n                              (he bolts to the front \n                              door)\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n               Bob stands holding Gil (in the glass) and his bag.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I'm sorry. Don't be mad. The Guttmans \n                         brought me.\n\n               Bob turns and waves at the Guttmans who are walking into an \n               OLD TRAILER that occupies next lot.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Thank you Mr. and Mrs. G.!\n\n                                     MRS.

THE MARVIN DOCK, SAME\n\n               Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now, \n               getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but \n               this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges \n               down the dock, Fay right behind him.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Enough. Let go of him!

He \n               realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does. \n               He looks at the Guttmans.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         What are you staring at?

THE MARVIN HOUSE DECK, AFTERNOON\n\n               Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay, \n               Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the \n               house and talks in low tones to his family.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Listen, everybody, I'm not wrong \n                         often, but when I am, I admit it. \n                         I'm sorry. I mean it. How can I make \n                         it up?\n\n               There is a pause.

Marvin turns to her. He keeps his \n               voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is \n               about to explode.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Leo...\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.

Anna heads over to him too. Marvin stands \n               speechless, ready to commit hari-kari.\n\n               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE PATIO, EVENING\n\n               Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the \n               moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along \n               the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin \n               family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking \n               the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob, \n               swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Get away.

Marvin \n               sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at \n               Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this \n               exchange of looks.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Did I do something?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         No, Bob.

In my home \n                         you will call me Dr. Marvin.\n\n               Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly \n               at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (low)\n                         He's nervous about the interview \n                         tomorrow.

Congratulations.\n\n               Marvin nods and eats. Bob throws salt over his shoulder then \n               salts his food.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Your book's going to do a lot of \n                         people a lot of good, Le-- Dr. Marvin. \n                         I'm walking proof of that.\n\n               Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad \n               on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         Dad?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Sweetheart?\n\n               Marvin turns red and points to his throat.

On the second try, Marvin's throat clears. \n               Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         Dad, you okay?\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         Daddy?!\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Honey?!\n\n               Marvin says something.

Bob is on \n               the couch, sitting alone, wearing Marvin's yellow slicker, \n               looking unwanted. Anna, Siggy and Fay sit quietly, watching \n               Marvin.

Bob smiles innocently. \n               Suddenly Bob takes out his air sickness bag and holds it out \n               as if to throw up in it.

A tiny, sadistic smile comes across his \n               face. There are a million things he'd like to say about Bob -- \n               to humiliate him, punish him, discredit him, ridicule him, \n               vilify him, pillory him -- on national TV.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Nothing.\n\n                                     MARIA\n                         Nothing?

Bob takes out his air sickness bag again. \n               He holds it for a long time then puts it away.

As Marvin \n               struggles, the car slips off the jack and slams to the \n               pavement. Marvin begins kicking the tire and hitting it with \n               the jack.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         What about Bob?! Think about Bob! \n                         What about Bob? What about Bob? WHAT \n                         ABOUT BOB!!\n\n               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK\n\n               Mumbling to himself, soaking wet, and filthy with tire grime, \n               Marvin walks to his house. He kicks open the front door.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         I'm home!\n\n               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK. MARVIN'S P.O.V.\n\n               Lights go on. Thirty people stand around the room with party \n               favors and drinks. In unison they yell:\n\n                                     PARTY GUESTS\n                         Surprise!\n                              (then sing:)\n                         \"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday \n                         to you! Happy Birthd...\n\n               The singing tapers into silence. Flabbergasted by Marvin's \n               disheveled appearance, the party guests stare. Fay and the \n               kids approach, tentatively.\n\n                                     SIGGY\n                         Dad, what happened?\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Nothing.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Leo, look at yourself!\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Just a little car trouble, hon. I'm \n                         fine.\n\n               Fay is speechless. So are Siggy and Anna. Not wanting to let \n               things sink, party-hardy well-wishers approach Leo.\n\n                                     PARTY GUEST 1\n                         Happy Birthday, Leo.\n\n                                     PARTY GUEST 2\n                         Some night to have car trouble. You \n                         almost missed your own surprise party!\n\n                                     BOB (O.S.)\n                         Happy Birthday, Dr. M!\n\n               Marvin turns and stares at Bob.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I couldn't miss your birthday!\n\n               Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He \n               pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         I want you dead! Dead, you hear me, \n                         dead!\n\n               Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull \n               him off.\n\n               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, NIGHT\n\n               Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the \n               party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest \n               whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man \n               who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's \n               bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak \n               in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         I've never seen him like this, Phil. \n                         He's got this delusion about Bob \n                         Wiley being the cause of all his \n                         problems and I don't know what to \n                         do.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His \n                         book, his interview which frankly \n                         didn't go so well, his birthday. \n                         That's a lot to bite off all at once. \n                         I'll give him a sedative and he'll \n                         be fine.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         You really think so?\n\n               Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.\n\n               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, NIGHT\n\n               Bob sits on the couch beside Siggy. Anna approaches.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         You feeling better?\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I'm fine. It's your dad I'm worried \n                         about. How is he?\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         Upstairs. Resting. I can't understand \n                         why he'd attack you like that.\n\n               Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across \n               the room, smiling at Anna.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I can't either. But one thing I've \n                         learned about psychiatrists: they're \n                         brilliant manipulators. I trust your \n                         dad completely. I'm sure everything \n                         he's done has been to help me.\n                              (pause)\n                         How come you aren't making a move on \n                         George Stark?\n\n                                     ANNA\n                              (glancing at George)\n                         Bob, we've talked about this.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         No, you've talked about it and I've \n                         listened. In my opinion, George \n                         Stark's smile is not Oedipal \n                         regression and it's not confused \n                         libido. It's one good looking guy \n                         drooling over you, Anna Marvin.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         Bob...\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Go ask if you can put your tongue in \n                         his mouth. I hear it works every \n                         time.\n\n               Anna smiles then summons her courage, and smilingly approaches \n               George. He is clearly delighted. A woman walks up to Bob.\n\n                                     WOMAN (LILY)\n                         Hi.

MARVIN'S DARKENED BEDROOM, NIGHT\n\n               Phil empties a large syringe into Marvin's buttock. He swats \n               Marvin's behind and Marvin pulls up his pj's.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         That should give you some interesting \n                         ideas for your next book.

I just can't believe \n                         you'd block something like that out. \n                         Carswell was at Harvard with us. You \n                         turned him in for cheating.\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         What...?\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Don't you remember? You brought action \n                         against him for stealing your \n                         psychoanalysis notes and they booted \n                         him. The only place that would take \n                         him after that was University of \n                         Guadalajara.\n\n               Marvin tries to speak but nothing comes out of his mouth. \n               Tomsky watches with concern.\n\n                                     TOMKSY\n                         Leo, is there something about Carswell \n                         that's disturbing you?

Marvin begins \n               shaking all over. As he does the bed rattles rapidly against \n               the wall. Leo's losing it. He's no longer the same sane man. \n               In the darkness we hear:\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         Baby steps, make a plan.\n\n               INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\n\n               Fay sleeps soundly next to Marvin who is wide eyed, staring \n               at the ceiling, twitching. Marvin pulls himself carefully \n               out of bed and crawls on the floor to the door.\n\n               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME\n\n               Marvin, carrying his shoes, crawls outside. He tries to put \n               his shoes on and falls flat on his face. He then pulls himself \n               up and hobbles away.\n\n               EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, MORNING\n\n               This is where the Marvin family was shopping when Bob first \n               came to town. Marvin paces outside until the owner opens the \n               front door for business.\n\n               INT. THE GENERAL STORE, MORNING\n\n               Marvin wanders through the hardware section, looking around. \n               FRED, the owner, works behind the counter.\n\n                                     FRED\n                         Can I help you, doctor?\n\n                                     MARVIN\n                         I want to buy a gun.\n\n                                     FRED\n                         Okay.\n\n               Fred walks to a case.\n\n                                     FRED\n                         I've got Winchesters.
