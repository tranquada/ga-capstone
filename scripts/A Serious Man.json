This white half-globe is a\n          plug set in a flesh-toned\n          field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting\n          toward the white plug\n          and, as we do so, the music grows louder still.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          AN EARPIECE\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          9\n</b>          A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap\n          white plastic earpiece\n          of a transistor radio.

A classroom,\n          apparently.\n          The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book\n          held open before it.

Its stained glass windows further weaken\n          the late-afternoon light.\n          In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas.\n          A long hold on their still backs.\n          At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and\n          we hear him sucking on\n          the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to\n          Ronnie Nudell.\n\n<b>          SUBURBAN STREET\n</b>          We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed,\n          still wearing his\n          yarmulka. It is dusk.\n          After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just\n          behind DANNY opens. A\n          husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run.\n          The sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins\n          to run. He reaches up\n          and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping\n          fists.\n          Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.\n          Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the\n          Brandt's front yard,\n          approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the\n          door.\n          Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          42\n</b>          Lights are on inside.

LARRY's head enters.\n          He climbs onto the roof.\n          He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively,\n          making sure of his\n          balance. He looks around.\n          His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective\n          on the street and\n          the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically,\n          gently\n          waves the trees.\n          LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof.\n          We are hearing a rhythmic\n          popping noise.\n          LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it.

With each toss\n          the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's.\n          Precariously balanced, LARRY reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively\n          touches it. He\n          grasps it.

Cantorial music.\n          LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly\n          til it dies, the sound drifting\n          away into the sybillant shushing of trees.\n          LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal\n          hum... cantorial singing...\n          and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.\n          Music. Crystal hum. Wind.\n\n<b>          MITCH\n</b>          Ow.\n          LARRY's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep\n          angle of father and son\n          playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in\n          the white fence that\n          encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.\n          Gar (off)\n          Good toss, Mitch.\n          On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon\n          bands woven over an\n          aluminum frame.

But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes\n          closed he relaxes, continu-\n          ing to stare.\n          She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY's age. Peaceful.\n          After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side.\n          It finds an ashtray on the\n          table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette.

Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding\n          head domed by a yarmul-\n          ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men\n          at the door without totally\n          revealing himself.

When at length he is finished he carefully justifies\n          the edges of the closest\n          pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that\n          seems to take some effort,\n          and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray.\n          He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked. His stunned look\n          on LARRY holds for a\n          long beat.\n          LARRY returns a bewildered look.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          100\n</b>          Solomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of\n          monster, emits one barking\n\n<b>          SYLLABLE:\n</b>          Solomon Schlutz\n          Gah!\n          His stare holds.

His backflung weight and twisting\n          body send his chair\n          tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the\n          other frantically waves.

The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam,\n          leaving sepulchral quiet.\n          DANNY, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study.\n          Minda's elderly\n          eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him.\n          Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop.\n          His look, eyes\n          magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read.\n          DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk. He gingerly sits on\n          the squeaking leather\n          upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare.\n          Minda breathes regularly through his mouth. It is the only sound\n          in the room.\n          A long beat. The two sit face to face.\n          Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak.\n          Another beat.\n\n<b>          FINALLY:\n</b>\n<b>          MINDA\n</b>          When the truth is found.

Minda stares.\n          He smacks his lips again.\n          . Then what?\n          DANNY doesn't answer. It is unclear whether the question was\n          directed at him.\n          Quiet.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          130\n</b>          Minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking.\n          The hawking abates. Minda sniffs.\n          . Grace Slick. Marty Balin. Paul Kanta. Jorma...\n          somethin. These are the membas of the Airplane.\n          He nods a couple of times.\n          . Interesting.\n          He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something\n          out. He lays it on\n          the bare desk and pushes it partway across.\n          . Here.\n          It is DANNY's radio.\n          .
