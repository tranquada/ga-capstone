She turns\n      her key in the lock, opens the door, then steps OUT OF\n      VIEW.\n\n14    INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              14\n      Joan stands briefly in the dark, apprehending something\n      untoward. She reaches to a wall switch, turns on the\n      lights and sees:\n\n      The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures\n      have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept\n      from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie\n      rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand\n      piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished\n      surface.\n\n      Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden\n      patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the\n      window stands partly open.\n      ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the\n      room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens\n      it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door\n      after her.\n\n\n15    INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY                    15\n      A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the\n      devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him:\n      (In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the\n      piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints\n      around the frame of the broken window.)\n\n                              MELVENOS\n                You sure nothing of value has been\n                removed from the dwelling?\n\n                              JOAN\n                No, nothing.

Just before she approaches the\n      mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her\n      thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:\n                                 JOAN\n                   No, no, Duke, don't do that,\n                   that's not nice.

Stopped by the sounds of\n      HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered\n      by her crutches and unable to move.\n      ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent\n      from Helen to Joan.\n\n      Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to\n      pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.\n      The man begins stalking around the front of the car\n      toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises\n      it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and\n      tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at\n      him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts\n      an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-\n      tinues to tug at the ax handle.\n                                  JOAN\n                   Helen!

I can't move!!\n\n      Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced\n      to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with\n      Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst\n      of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her\n      grasp and lunges at her.\n\n)O(    MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 5/30/91                           69.\n\nX64A   INT.

Thinking he's gone\n       rabid, she screams and tries to hide behind one of the\n       weight racks.

In the\n       struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand.\n       He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She\n       reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes\n       him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and\n       enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately\n       grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns\n       fiercely toward him.\n       Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently\n       having had enough, he begins to back away from her.

He goes\n      through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of\n      suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands.\n      Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its\n      mate on the other side of the bed.\n\n      CLOSE ON HARRY\n      He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close\n      it when he sees:\n\n\n      POV OF DRAWER\n      A gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small\n      wrapped box.\n      He picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain\n      white card with a handwritten message on it:\n\n\n      CLOSE ON CARD\n      \"Thank you for everything you've done for me, Harry, and\n      mostly, for being in my life.

Then he puts\n      the card back, picks up the box and without removing it\n      from the drawer, gives it a little shake.\n\n72A   EXT.

On his way, he glances somberly\n       over his shoulder at the house. In so doing his gaze\n       falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the Mercedes. He\n       stops and walks back to the car.\n       Once again, he takes hold of the ax handle and makes\n       several attempts to dislodge it. In a final Arthurian\n       effort, the blade yields and he pulls the ax free. He\n       suddenly steps back away from the car, as a steamy spray\n       of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top\n       of the hood. Then he glances guiltily toward the house,\n       and moves to his van with Duke following.\n\n\n101A   EXT.
