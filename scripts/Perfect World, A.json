At\n              approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed\n              a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed\n              the store's owner.\n                               REPORTER #1\n              Is the prison employee with them?\n                               RED\n              Was when they left the prison.\n     Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern\n     observing.

Sally is taken aback but then\n     warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press\n     conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off\n     a bit, but....\n\n     There are no questions. In fact there is utter silence as\n     every raised hand drops.

Every reporter, that is,\n     except one.\n     He's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his\n     hand.\n     Sally, unsure what to do, looks to him...\n                               SALLY\n              You have a question?\n\n                               REPORTER\n              Yes I do.\n     Sally smiles a bit then puts on her serious face awaiting...\n                               REPORTER\n              You doin' anything tonight?\n     Sally, steamed, glares at the guy and stomps out of the\n     room.\n                               REPORTER\n              I'm serious!\n36   INT.

Jerry smiles,\n     almost to himself, and FIRES TWICE more for the hell of it.\n     The ROOF of the Impala EXPLODES with two holes as the car\n     speeds off down the highway.\n\n39   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                         39\n     Red is finishing up with several reporters near the door to\n     the parking lot. Adler jumps in, holds up his hands.\n                               ADLER\n              All right, that's it, boys.   Chief's got\n              work to do.\n     Red and Adler move through the parking lot to SAUNDERS, 50, an\n     aide to the Governor. Saunder's seconds are a PHOTOGRAPHER,\n     young and energetic, and SUTTLE, 35, dark-haired, with a\n     cowlick.\n     Saunders shakes Red's hand and they turn to gaze upon...\n     '60-STYLE AIRSTREAM MOBILE HOME\n     parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new\n     Chevy truck. The Airstream is painted in state colors and\n     sports banners, decals and logos.\n\n40   EXT.

He moves in next to Red and poses as the camera\n     clicks.\n                                SAUNDERS\n              We are very proud of this baby.

Adler and a few others start to\n     load equipment, guns and files into the motor home. In\n     addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc.\n     and stack them in a pile outside the motor home.\n     The Photographer continues to snap photos.\n\n                               SAUNDERS\n                      (to Red)\n              Whattaya' doin', Red?!\n                      (to Photographer)\n              Stop takin' pictures!\n     Red does away with the parade banner.

He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure,\n     wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots.\n                               ADLER\n                      (to Saunders)\n              S'cuse me.\n                      (to Red)\n              This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist\n              with the Feds. They want him to tag along.\n     Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.

Red closes the door as the\n     motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger\n     side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window.\n                               SAUNDERS\n              Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle?\n              Not a scratch!\n     Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's\n     pissed and overloaded with files.\n     AIRSTREAM\n     about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later\n     the door opens and the steps pop out.\n     Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door...\n     ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.   The Airstream\n     moves another 20 feet then stops.\n     Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out\n     of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously\n     forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again,\n     when she gets close...\n\n     ...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure\n     wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box\n     in anger.\n     The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS,\n     i.e. -- \"Okay, Okay.\" More LAUGHTER. Red steps    out the door,\n     turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop\n     on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight\n     for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream.\n     When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who\n     stews and holds her ground.\n                               RED\n              You comin' or not?\n     She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red,\n     grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.\n\n                                                                29.\n41   OMITTED                                                          41\n42   INT.

A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily\n     gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man,\n     and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee.\n     When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and\n     drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help\n     but she gives them the evil eye.\n                                SALLY\n               I've got it.\n     She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She\n     looks up to the men staring at...\n     Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh.\n     She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll\n     dangling on his chin.\n                                SALLY\n               You've got shit on your face.\n     Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face.\n43   EXT.

She giggles and licks her lips.\n      Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who\n      immediately turns away from them. When Butch returns his\n      attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is\n      refilling ketchup bottles.\n                                BUTCH\n               Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want.\n                                PHILLIP\n               No thankyew.\n\n      Eileen slides back down toward Butch.

They're gone.\n      Phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front\n      window of the diner.\n\n      PHILLIP'S POV - DINER\n      It is empty. He sees that the kitchen swinging door is still\n      swinging on its hinges.\n150   INT. DINER - ADJUNCT OFFICE - NIGHT                             150\n      A one room addition office built onto    the kitchen. It has a\n      desk against one wall, a few chairs, a    fan -- pretty sparse.\n      Two large windows throw light from the    outside neon sign onto\n      the room. A large lamp provides harsh     light.\n      Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door\n      behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch\n      lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and\n      neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the\n      ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress\n      outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and\n      suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins\n      kissing her voluptuous backside.\n\n151A EXT.

He moves down the wall to a\n      window positioned right at the desk. When he stops he's right\n      in front of the window, separated from Butch and Eileen by\n      only a foot of air and a thin plate of glass.\n\n                                                              96.\n151D PHILLIP'S POV - BUTCH AND EILEEN                               151D\n      Kissing, writhing, but FROM this ANGLE  all he can really see\n      is a mane of hair swinging to and fro.   Butch is out of sight\n      but it's obvious that his lips continue  to caress Eileen's\n      backside. She cranes her neck, arching   it like a swan,\n      moaning like a wildebeast and then...\n      She stops and stares STRAIGHT AHEAD. Butch continues to kiss\n      but only for a beat, sensing the locomotive he's on has\n      stopped at an unscheduled station. He slides his face from\n      around her rear, a la Kilroy, and he stares, too. Except for\n      their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art\n      statues staring STRAIGHT AHEAD AT...\n152A INT.
