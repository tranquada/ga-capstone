Phillip backs\n      away two steps and falls to his knees. Butch wavers for a\n      second then topples on his back.\n      Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT still\n<b>      ECHOING.\n</b><b>      AT ROADSIDE\n</b>      Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of\n      officers.\n\n<b>                                  HENDRICKS\n</b>                 Keep everybody back!\n      Bobby Lee stands, lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at\n      Hendricks.\n<b>                                     BOBBY LEE\n</b>                 No need to worry.

After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of\n      shoes with   a sudden right cross that floors the younger man.\n      Red starts   to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps\n      in, grabs   Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the\n      older man   back. Shouting, i.e. \"Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!\"\n      Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises\n      to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who\n      is still breathing hard.\n<b>                                  HENDRICKS\n</b>                 What the hell was that all about?!\n<b>                                  RED\n</b>                 I didn't say 'when.'\n<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                143.\n</b><b>229   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               229\n</b>      Red turns and walks away.

There\n                was just no way of knowin'.\n      Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking.    Adler\n      stops, his eyes following Red.\n      Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away.\n<b>      PHILLIP\n</b>      is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly\n      to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained\n      Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume\n      and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead\n      Phillip off but he won't leave until...\n      He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand.\n<b>      CLOSEUP - PHILLIP\n</b>      Staring down at Butch.\n<b>      CLOSEUP - BUTCH\n</b>      His eyes flutter a bit with recognition.\n\n<b>      AT PATROL CAR\n</b>      Red leans against the car.   After a few seconds Sally walks\n      up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she, too,\n      leans against the car. After a few more seconds.\n<b>                                 SALLY\n</b>                You did everything you could.
