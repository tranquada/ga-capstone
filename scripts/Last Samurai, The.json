One samurai is just sitting\non his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.\n\nThe MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.\n\nAlgren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He\nspears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in\nhalf, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.\n\nThe Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.\nHe continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after\nThose around him have fled.\n\nThen a blaze of bright yellow \u00ad a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing\narrows steadily from horseback.

He kills one\nsamurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.\n\nIn agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried\ndeep in his chest, and fights on.\n\nHe manages to parry a blow \u00ad which SLICES into his side. The next blow\ntakes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.\n\nAlgren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against\ncertain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren\nwhirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still\ndangling from the end.\n\nThe MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,\nwhose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His\neyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger\nholding the dogs at bay.\n\nIn SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing\nBLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his\nkatana.\nAlgren seems spent \u00ad he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing\nconsciousness.\n<b>                                                                      .\n</b>But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren\nsuddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his\nattacker.\n\nAs the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.\n\nA harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.\n\nThe Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially\nso that be might pass by without being jostled.                    .\n\nHe looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.\n\nAnd we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai.

His sword flashes--\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                                                      35.\n</b>Gant is eviscerated.

He crawls to Gant,\nblood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.\n\nGant is dead.\n\nAlgren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.\nOr are surrendering, injured or dead.\n\nAnd he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,\nhead down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.\n\nKatsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems\nto agree to something.\n\nBoth men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who\nholds it out firmly.\n\nGeneral Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging\nit into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.\n\nIt is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.\n\nAlgren watches, stunned.\n\nThen a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.\n\nAlgren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial\nsoldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.\n\nAlgren looks over the slaughter.\n\nAnd then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him.\n\nFade to...\n\n<b>EXT.

As he passes, ever y person in\nthe village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect.\n\nMost of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with\ncuriosity. And suspicion.\n\nKatsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai\nhelps Algren painfully slide from his horse.\n\nKatsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house.

He wants Algren to drop the sword.\nIt is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.\n\nUjio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,\nonly his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.\n\nUjio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's\nsword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid\nmovement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the\nchest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his\nkneels.\n\nSatisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the\nbystanders cause him to turn back: .\n\nAlgren is standing again, and again holding the sword.\n\nWith grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.\n\nAgain Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before\nhe is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                                          45.\n</b> Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling\non the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.\n\nAgain, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.\n\nBut Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren\nin the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,\nAlgren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into\nAlgren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.\n\nThe ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.\nThis time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's\nnow defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then\nfinally the head.\n\nAlgren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.\nUjio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.\n\n<b>INT.

A steep mountain pass. Slopes on either\nside create a funnel ahead of them. The Imperial Army will have to pass through the\nfunnel to reach them.\n\nOn a hill above them\n\nHigen is revealed. He looks down first at the five hundred Samurai, then\nsees, beyond, the overwhelming mass of the IMPERIAL ARMY.\n\nBack on the battlefield\n\nA distant thud followed by a high-pitched whine.

Then artillery rounds begin to fall among them.\n\nSamurai are blown to pieces as they bravel y stand and await\ndeath. Katsumoto BARKS a command to Ujio.\n\nSuddenly, the Samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense\nalignment. The artillery rounds now fall ineffectually where once\nthey stood.\n\nBagley directs the artillery to be re-targeted, It is a laborious, clumsy\nprocess. They fire again. Another command.

Many fall.\n\nAlgren nods to Katsumoto, Katsumoto then calls out a command and the\nsamurai retreat.\n\nThey race back toward the rear of the funnel.\n\nThe Imperial Army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and\npursue--\n\nThe samurai, meanwhile, have taken cover behind a second barricade that\nhad been hidden from the Imperial soldiers' view. Now safel y behind\nthe second barricade, Katsumoto calls out a command and--\n\nThe samurai fire!\n\n500 arrows explode -- almost instantly followed by 500 more --\n\nLike an image from Agincourt, the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky --\n\nImperial Soldiers fall, the attack falters--\n\nFrom behind the new barricades, archers fire FLAMING ARROWS, that\nHit the old barricade.
