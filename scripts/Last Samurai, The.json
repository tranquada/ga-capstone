Union and Confederate soldiers slam together, falling, drowning in mud\nand blood, stepped on by panicked hones.\n\nAlgren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other, serving\ndeath on all sides.\n\n\nA soldier riding next to Davey is shot.

He is a truly gifted swordsman.\n\nA tree branch knocks Davey from his horse. He sits, dazed, on the ground.\nAlgren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him.\n\nSingle-handedly, be rallies his men, screaming orders, then lifts his wounded\nbrother onto the saddle beside him.\n\nHe leads them downhill toward safel y, Davey clinging to him for dear life.\n\nBack to the convention hall:\n\n                                             ALGREN\n                           Before they knew what hit them, we had broken\n                           through into the rear of the rebel army.\n\nOn Sutter's Hill:\n\nAlgren and his men gather in a copse of trees.

Trees are shredded.\n\n\nAlgren's men are literally cut to pieces-\n\nDavey is riddled with bullets, his dead body shielding Algren from harm until\nhe slides, lifeless, to the mud.\n\n                                                ALGREN\n                            Davey---!!!!\n\nMen and horses are torn apart -- they contort and writhe in agony \u00ad jerking\ngrotesquely as the bullets rip into them. Algren frantica1ly tries to locate the\nsource of this firepower. Then he sees:\n\nA Gatling Gun.\n\nSix barrels glisten like steel teeth. This early machine gun is the pinnacle of\ncurrent military might -- 60 rounds a second -- a triumph in engineering.\n\n                                        ALGREN\n                            AHHHHHHH--!!!!!\n\nWith insane courage, he wheels and charges the gun.\n\nBullets rip into horse and rider alike.

TOKYO \u00ad STREET                           EVENING\n\nTokyo is a city in chaos. Everything seems out of balance. Dystopic. A\ncollision of Eastern and Western.

Something draws his attention:\n\nAcross the street. a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk. His martial\nbearings, two swords, traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly\nidentify him to us as a samurai.                                       .\n\nWe will meet him again later, he is UJIO. A terse, grim man in his 40's.

But two young\nJapanese in Western dress do not.\n\nUjio stands before them, waiting for them to move. They don't.\nTense words are exchanged. Ujio glares at them.

He's\n                           waiting for them to show deference.\n\nAcross the street, Uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two\nJapanese men. They laugh in response. Then one of the men raises a hand\nand barks some clearly disrespectful words back--\n\nLike lightning-- Ujio pulls out his long samurai sword - it flashes --\n\nCleanly beheading the disrespectful Japanese man --\n\n\nThe beheaded corpse begins to fall--\n\nIn one smooth motion, Ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls\nand sweeps it back into its scabbard. The other man immediately drops to\nhis belly, prostrating himself.\n\nWithout another glance, Ujio walks awa y.

A light SNOW begins to fall.\n\nAlgren continues to peer into the fog. Nothing.\n\nThen a sound ... distant ... building through the fog...\n\nThe steady rumble of horses. Slowl y approaching. Closer and closer...\n\nAlgren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear.\n\nAlgren peers again into the fog. Nothing. But the sound is closer.\n\nThen the sound abruptly stops.\n\nSilence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers.\n\n                                              ALGREN\n                            Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume\n                            staggered firing positions.\n\n                                             GANT\n                            Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.\n\nHis order is translated. The Japanese soldiers prepare to fire, one\nrow kneeling, the other standing behind them.\n\nOne of the Japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension.\n\nAlgren can see nothing through the dense fog. The tension is unbearable.\n\nThen a form on horseback... ghostly... like lame sort of medieval\nmonster. An elaborate, horned helmet. Sweeping samurai armor.\n\nAll we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog.\n\n\nLike something from a nightmare.\n\nAnd then another figure... and another ... as 500 mounted samurai warriors\nslowl y move into position.\n\n                                                                                     32.\nThe Japanese troops are terrified\n\n\n                                              GANT\n                                   (quickly)\n                           Hold the line ... hold the line...\n\nThe order is translated.\n\nA terrible, beautiful moment of absolute stasis.\n\nNothing moves.\n\nThe Japanese soldiers wait.\n\nThe ghostly silhouettes wait.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen -- as if a silent signal were given -- the samurai suddenly CHARGE,\nemerging from the fog in a great wave--! The force of a tsunami.\n\nThe silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war-\ncries that chill the blood -- sweeping forward on their hones like\nlightning -swords and spears flashing\n\n                                               ALGREN\n                           FIRE!\n\nThe Japanese troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot\nrifles -- others fumble at the ask and then break and run--\n\nPanic and chaos--\n\n                                               ALGREN\n                           Hold the line!\n\nToo late-- the samurai are on them--\n\nThey attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese\nsoldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered--\nrun through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata.\n\nThose soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly\nmowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted\nSamurai.\n\n                                             ALGREN\n                           Sound fall back! Sound fall back!\n\nA bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat.\n\nBut suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the\nfog and more mounted samurai appear.\n\n                                                                                     33.\n\nThey are surrounded.\n\nAlgren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline\nsoon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--\n\nThe battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by\nlances, run down and trampled by horses.\n\nEach samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle\nflags sweep through the fog.\n\nGant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of\nammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester\nrepeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--\n\nAlgren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when\nthe revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry\nthe lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --\n\nBut one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course\nand SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground.\n\nAlgren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another\nrider heads toward him carrying a lance.\n\nAlgren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the\nlance from his grip and running him through.\n\nIn the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting\non his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.\n\nThe MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.\n\nAlgren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He\nspears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in\nhalf, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.\n\nThe Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.\nHe continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after\nThose around him have fled.\n\nThen a blaze of bright yellow \u00ad a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing\narrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding.\n\nWe will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai.\n\nYoritomo fires arrow upon arrow \u00ad the speed is breathtaking \u00ad Two arrows\nslam into Gant, knocking him to the ground.\n\nThe battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight\nare easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey.\n\nLeft alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru \u00ad samurai foot\nsoldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other\n\n                                                                                                         34.\nsamurai wielding katana \u00ad the lethal long sword.\n\nBut rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one\nsamurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.\n\nIn agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried\ndeep in his chest, and fights on.\n\nHe manages to parry a blow \u00ad which SLICES into his side. The next blow\ntakes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.\n\nAlgren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against\ncertain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren\nwhirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still\ndangling from the end.\n\nThe MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,\nwhose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His\neyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger\nholding the dogs at bay.\n\nIn SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing\nBLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his\nkatana.\nAlgren seems spent \u00ad he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing\nconsciousness.\n                                                                      .\nBut as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren\nsuddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his\nattacker.\n\nAs the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.\n\nA harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.\n\nThe Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially\nso that be might pass by without being jostled.                    .\n\nHe looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.\n\nAnd we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an\nimposing man of about Algren's years.\n\nSensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto.\nWith blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard.\n\nAlgren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO.\n\nKatsumoto looks down at Algren.\n\nThen Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his\nrifle, urgently trying to save Algren--\n\nUjio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to\nprotect his Lord. His sword flashes--\n\n                                                                                                      35.\nGant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror.\n\nA dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he\nsinks to his knees.\n\nKatsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off.\n\nAlgren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,\nblood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.\n\nGant is dead.\n\nAlgren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.\nOr are surrendering, injured or dead.\n\nAnd he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,\nhead down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.\n\nKatsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems\nto agree to something.\n\nBoth men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who\nholds it out firmly.\n\nGeneral Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging\nit into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.\n\nIt is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.\n\nAlgren watches, stunned.\n\nThen a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.\n\nAlgren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial\nsoldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.\n\nAlgren looks over the slaughter.\n\nAnd then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him.\n\nFade to...\n\nEXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                               DAY\n\nAlgren is unconscious, tied to a horse.\n\nThe mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing\ninto the soaring mountains of Yoshino.\n\nEXT.              VILLAGE                                    SUNSET\n\nKatsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen.\n\nThe gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow-\ncapped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields.\n\n                                                                                    36.\n\nAfter the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional,\nwooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly\nabsent from the cities.\n\nAlgren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood.\n\nKatsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in\nthe village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect.\n\nMost of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with\ncuriosity. And suspicion.\n\nKatsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai\nhelps Algren painfully slide from his horse.\n\nKatsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall\ninto formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed\nGant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y.\n\nUjio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't\nmove. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a\ncaged panther spitting invective at Algren.\n\nAlgren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will.\nHis wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand.\n\nSUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the\nblade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face!\nAlgren doesn't move.\n\nUjio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs\nwhere even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move.\n\nUjio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away.\n\nKatsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English.\nAlgren is surprised.\n\n                                            KATSUMOTO\n                           You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains\n                           and winter is coming.\n\nKatsumoto turns and walks into his house. Uji o follows him. Algren collapses.\n\nFade to black.\n\nAs Algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world.\n\n\nINT.

The woman is changing the dressing on\nhis wounded right shoulder and arm.\n\nYoritomo kneels across from Algren. He is impressed at the many battle\nwounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. In Japanese, he\nindicates his admiration.\n\nAlgren his no idea what Yoritomo is saying.

His body is convulsed with shivering.\nHis withdrawal from alcohol, his wounds, his isolation and his imagined sins\nare devouring him.                                                                .\n\nThen we see he is not alone.

YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           DAYS LATER\n\nDaylight streams in, finding Algren lying on his back. The worst of the detox\nis past. As be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to:\n\nA sudden flash of memory:\n\nThe beautiful blond WOMAN from the picture laughs merrily, and falls\nback languorousl y in a grassy fi eld.\n\nBack in the room\n\nAlgren shakes off the memory as harsh SOUNDS from outside draw him to\nthe window.                  .\n\nEXT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      MORNING\n\nAlgren watches from the window as the samurai train. It is like nothing else\nin the world. Part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training\ncom bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.\n\nFinally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the\nspectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master\npractice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control.\n\nNAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed,\nfour samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly\ndefeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.\n\nKyudo (\"The Way of the Bow\") masters use their bows for target practice.\nYoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums.\n\nAlgren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open.\n\nAnd then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- Yoritomo fires the arrows --\none after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. The final arrow\nsplits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree.\n\nA wooden sword leans against the porch.\n\nAlgren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and\ngrabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him.\n\n                                                                                  41.\n\n\nThe training stops, as everyone watches Uji o berate Algren.\n\nEven as Ujio continues screaming. Algren simply shakes his head, turns\nawa y, and walk back into the house.\n\nINT.               YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         DAY\n\nAs the sounds of training resume outside, Algren explores the house.\n\nHe comes upon Higen and Toshiie playing with the red ball. They are\nembarrassed to encounter him alone. There's a moment of suspension, and\nthen Higen throws the ball to Algren.\n\nAlgren looks back and forth between the two boys, fixes his gaze on Higen\nbut throw the ball to Toshiie, causing both boys to laugh and run awa y.\n\nAlgren walks on.\n\nINT.                SMALL ROOM                           DAY\n\n\nAlgren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been\nmade into a kind of shrine.\n\nCand1es and incense burn, a small Buddha sits on a dais, and Algren's eyes\nare drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner.\n\nThe BRIGHT RED ARMOR of the warrior Algren killed in the fog, is held\nupright by an unseen stand. It is almost as if the dead warrior himself is\nswing back at him.\n\nAlgren senses someone behind him and turns. The woman is standing across\nthe hall. Their eyes meet. She turn, and walks away.\n\nEXT.               VILLAGE                            NIGHT\n\nA first, light snowfall has covered the ground. A1gren walks out into the still\nnight. He turns a corner and confronts curious sight:\n\nTen warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration.\n\nAs Algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that Katsumoto is now\nstanding next to him.\n\n                                                   KATSUMOTO\n                              They are training.\n\n                                                   ALGREN\n                              Training what?\n\n                                                 KATSUMOTO\n                              Their minds.

A banked fire smolders beneath it.\n\nEmbarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren\nstrips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water.\n\nYoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to\nWestern privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man.\n\nYoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they\nbathe, showing off his old battle wounds.\n\n                                                                                      44.\nAlgren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother\nappears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub!\n\nAlgren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at\nhim with her toothless grin.\n\nEXT.            VILLAGE                          DAY\n\nAlgren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first\ntime, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at\nhis Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass\nby Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords.\n\nNearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden\nswords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly,\nmurmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking\nabout.\n\nHigen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren,\nwho deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the\nboys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren.\n\nAlgren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish --\ncausing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in\nHigen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on\nthe attack.\n\nAlgren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer.\n\nSuddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns.\n\nUjio is standing behind him, arms folded.\n\nUjio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword.\nIt is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.\n\nUjio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,\nonly his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.\n\nUjio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's\nsword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid\nmovement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the\nchest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his\nkneels.\n\nSatisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the\nbystanders cause him to turn back: .\n\nAlgren is standing again, and again holding the sword.\n\nWith grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.\n\nAgain Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before\nhe is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.\n\n                                                                                          45.\n Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling\non the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.\n\nAgain, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.\n\nBut Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren\nin the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,\nAlgren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into\nAlgren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.\n\nThe ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.\nThis time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's\nnow defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then\nfinally the head.\n\nAlgren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.\nUjio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.\n\nINT.

AROUND THE INN                                 NIGHT\n\nThe samurai guards are alert, their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions.\n\nBut there is another way. Another way of learning combat. A wa y without the\nbeaut y, the philosophy and the moral code.\n\nThey are almost imperceptible at first... their head-to-toe black clothes a perfect\ncamouflage... their silence and stealth are otherworldly.\n\n                                                                                                     66.\n\nThey were then known as Shinobi, masters of stealth and spying.\n\nWe know them as Ninjas.\n\nThey float across the ground ... creeping an inch ever y hour... complete\nphysica1 control. One black-gloved finger moves. Then the next...\n\nThey crawl and then wait\n\n\nPoised on their fingertips and toes.\n\nThere is no sound as they strike.\n\nThe samurai guards are garroted in an instant. Other Ninjas catch the\nsamurai's weapons as they fall. No sound disturbs the peaceful night.\n\nEXT.

Ten feet awa y.\n\nHe pulls out a shuriken -- a small needle-shaped projectile, dips it into a sack of\npoison. Places it carefully into the palm of his hand. And with the flick of his\nwrist--\n\nThe needle flies -- stabbing into the samurai -- he crumples.\n\nOther Ninjas immediately pour over the edge of the roof -- catching the samurai before he falls...\n\nINT.

Above his head, unbeknownst to him, two Ninjas descend on ropes.\nOne of them swings a long chain - to which I barbed-knife is attached.\n\nAs it lodges in the guard's chest, the second Ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard,\nsilently, before his body hits the ground.\n\nINT.

He instantly\nkills one Ninja using his steel-tipped \"war fan\" to slash his attackers throat. Another smashes\nin through the window.\n\nINT.

The Ninja dodges the blow and slices at Algren with short-sword.\n\nAlgren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword LODGES\ndeep in the wood.

Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood-\nstain SPREADS across the pastoral painting.\n\nBut another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As\nAlgren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF.\n\nHe drops the sword, momentarily defenseless.\n\nAcross the hallway\n\nYoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls.\nAlgren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow.\n\nIn Katsumoto's room\n\nAlgren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade.

Men bite and wrestle and gouge to\nsurvive in close quarters.\n\nAll of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired, heaving for breath, their skin flayed\nopen, their kimonos ripped, their hands and arms and faces blood-stained.\n\nBut more samurai reinforcements follow Ujio up the stairs: Together with Yoritomo\nand Nakao, they have begun to gain the upper hand.\n\nUjio flings both his swords through the air -- killing two Ninjas -- and dives to\nfight others - his martial arts skills are dazzling.\n\nAlgren and Katsumoto are fighting sidc by side\n\nAnd we cut to --\n\nEXT.

Then one from his own.\n\nWe move up another level, past more bodies...\n\nUjio moves through the Ninjas. Making sure they are dead.

Finally, Algren nods.\n\nKatsumoto moves to Yoritomo, leans in for a few final words, taking his\nhead and pressing his forehead to Yoritomo's.\n\nBullets begin ricocheting around them -- Yoritomo looks to Algren:\n\n                                              YORITOMO\n                                    (subtitled)\n                           Tell my family.\n\nAlgren bows his bead in respect.\n\nThen Algren leads them up the stairs.

Smiles.\n\nThen he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs--\n\nThe guards fire hitting Yoritomo - but still he comes -- wading into them\nswords flashing -- he is hit again and again -- but still he comes.\n\nIt is a glorious death.\n\nEXT.

But now three more soldiers have levelled their\nweapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he\ntries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him.

The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement\nbefore a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him.
