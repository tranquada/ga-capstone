Sinatra used to play at the\n               500 Club, and we used to take our\n               dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna\n               go and hear Sinatra?' Then we'd\n               just lean on the door of the club\n               in the alley and listen to the\n               music. I think the girls were\n               looking for something a bit more\n               uptown.\n     Nora laughs.\n                             NORA\n               I'd go with you and lean against\n               the door.\n     They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans\n     toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the\n     RECORD STICKS on the words \"that's the time\"... \"that's\n     the time\"... \"that's the time\"... BB slips off one of his\n     loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it\n     hits the side of the record table.
