The\nbackyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn\nfrom use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a\npicnic table.\n\nThe backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. \nSix feet high.\n\nEverything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A\nCHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S\nCOMING FROM.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nGRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard\nsomething.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE\nREFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS\nOUTSIDE CHIRPING.\n\nGraham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and\nwhite Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the\nbedroom door.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING\n\nGraham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors\nmeet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings\ntaped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.\n\nHe relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up\nsweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He\nputs it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his\nbedroom.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING\n\nA bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR\nTHE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.\n\nOutside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded\noutline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's\nghostly stained forever on the blank wall.\n\nA CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.\n\nThe water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the\ndoorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very\nstill.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nThe bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his\nchildren's room.  There are children's books everywhere. \nOverflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.\n\nGraham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both\nempty.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nWE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT\nINTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.\n\nMERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings\nonto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. \nMerrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His\nmuscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and\nlooks around bewildered.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

CROPS - MORNING\n\nThe tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as\nthey run through the crops.\n\nA LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them\nlike an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.\n\nThey reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. \nHer hair is messed from sleep.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Bo where's Morgan?\n\nBO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Bo?\n\nBo finally looks at her father.  Beat.

He's\nclose.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.\n\nHe finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his\npajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Morgan what's happening?\n\nGraham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of\nMorgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.\n\nGraham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's\nlooking straight at him.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Are... you... hurt?\n\nBeat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          I think God did it.\n\nBeat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Did what Morgan?\n\nMorgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his\nface.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham\nsees something.\n\nGraham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving\nforward towards something.\n\nHe walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a\nclearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. \nThey are clearly agitated.\n\nGraham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING\nFLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED\nFEET WIDE.\n\nGraham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the\ncenter.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.\n\nThe dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL\nTHE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.\n\nWE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE\nHUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,\nUNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.\n\nLEGEND:\n\n               \"BUCKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA...\n             THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA\"\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME\n\nGraham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the\nright temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to\nhis ear.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (into phone)\n          ... Lee actually the reason I'm\n          calling is about Lionel.\n\nGraham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (into phone)\n          Was he at home last night with you\n          or was he out and about with the\n          Wolfington brothers?\n\nGraham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads\ntowards the house.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (into phone)\n          Well, there was a little mischief\n          done to our crops last night.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (into phone)\n          I know he's a fine boy... No one's\n          saying otherwise.\n\nGraham steps through the back screen door into his\n\nKITCHEN.\n\nGraham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED\nVOICE.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (into phone)\n          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it\n          was him.  You could just talk to\n          him and that would be enough for\n          me... See it was kind of strange\n          finding the crops like that.  The\n          kids were... confused by it.  It\n          would take the strangeness away if\n          we knew it was Lionel and the\n          Wolfington brothers just messing\n          around...\n              (beat, listens)\n          The movies...\n              (beat)\n          Are you sure?\n              (beat)\n          Okay, then... Thank you for your\n          patience Lee.\n\nGraham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the\ncounter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen\nfloor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a\nLARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.\n\nGraham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.\n          Reynolds.\n\nMorgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on\ntheir faces.\n\nGraham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the\npuddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his\nknees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down\nthe hall.\n\nA balding police officer stands on the other side of the\nscreen door.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          That was quick Edgar.  I only\n          called you boys about two hours\n          ago.\n\nOFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as\n          she put it, \"diving for her life\"\n          when a bunch of school kids rode\n          down the sidewalk on skateboards. \n          She went down to Thorton's store\n          this morning and started spitting\n          on the new skateboards.

He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,\nbefore walking over to Houdini.\n\nThe two children sit down in the grass with the dog.\n\nBo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. \nShe stops.

It's here that\nhe notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces\nwatching him from the station wagon.\n\nThe leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets\nin, turns it on, and without looking over to the station\nwagon, backs out of the parking lot.\n\nBeat.

Morgan raises the\nmonitor above his head.\n\nTHE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.\n\nTHE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES\nSOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN\nTHE DISTANCE.\n\nTHE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND\nLOUDER.\n\nBo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Hold on.\n\nGraham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes\nhold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.\n\nMorgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill\nholds him by the waist.\n\nBo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and\nthe windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both\nhands.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Merrill you got her.\n\nMerrill reaches out his free hand.

Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the\nroof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor\nraised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still\non the hood of their station wagon as they listen.\n\nTHE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND\nUPFRONT.

THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED\nBY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE\nTONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS\nANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.\n\nGraham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her\narms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the\nincredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.\n\nTHE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.\n\nMorgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER\nAND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES\nALMOST GONE.\n\nTHE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST\nVIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.\n\nBeat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights\nare off.

BACKYARD - EVENING\n\nWE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. \nThe LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and\nthe children doing dishes after dinner.\n\nThe DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.\n\nOUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. \nIsabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post\noutside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically. \nShe keeps looking in our direction.\n\nWE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE\nHOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of\ndog food and a bowl of water.\n\nWe watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he\ngets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully. \nHe places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has\nno interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our\ndirection.\n\nGraham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND\nLOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.\n\nWE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BARN - EVENING\n\nGraham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the\ndog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes\nstay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to\nno one.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You know something?  Even\n          entertaining the possibility of\n          this for a minute has been\n          exciting.\n\nBeat.  Graham starts to move.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I can see how people can get\n          carried away with this type of\n          thing.\n\nGraham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on\nthe picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW\nBEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.\n\nGraham starts toward the crops.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          It's a kind of faith.  It's an\n          intoxicating thing to believe in\n          something you can't see.\n\nTHE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE\nBACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and\nthen steps into the field of\n\nCORN CROPS.\n\nWe can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of\ncorn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A\nWAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You were always good at that...\n\nTHE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham\nstarts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either\nside.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Believing in things you couldn't\n          see.\n              (beat)\n          You would have been the first\n          person on that station wagon\n          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would\n          have been wrestling for that baby\n          monitor.\n\nSOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.\n\nGraham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing\nbut crops disappearing into darkness.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          It'll be secretly kind of sad for\n          everybody, when this turns out to\n          be -- all just make believe.\n\nTHERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims\nthe FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY\nPENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (yelling)\n          You're wasting your time here!  I'm\n          not going to report this or\n          anything you do to me crops, to the\n          news or TV or anybody!  You're not\n          going to get famous!\n\nBeat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN\nBREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF\nHIM.\n\nBeat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE\nBREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.\n\nGraham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE\nBEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.\n\nGRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE\nBREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS\nFAST AND LOUD NOW.\n\nGraham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands\nsearch over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch\nthe flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the\n\"on\" button.  He does.\n\nA BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY\nWHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.\n\nIt instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get\nup.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in\ncrops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts\nrunning.\n\nLeaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. \nHe doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING\nBEHIND HIM.\n\nGraham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front\nof him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as\nhe can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.\n\nAnother sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his\n\nBACKYARD.\n\nGraham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS\nFRANTICALLY.\n\nWhen Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.\n\nThere is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet\naway sway in the gentle night breeze.\n\nGraham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to\nthe screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - EVENING\n\nGraham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His\nshirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He\nlocks the back door.\n\nThe children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing\neach other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.\n\nGraham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. \nHe sees Merrill there.\n\nMerrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN\nBASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't\nnotice him either.\n\nGraham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes\na seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs\none shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and\nthinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows\nhis mind.  Beat.\n\nMerrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the\nbaseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the\nchildren at the sink, he turns off the faucet.\n\nThe children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They\nfollow his stare to the kitchen table.\n\nBeat.  Graham looks up at them.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          Okay.\n              (beat)\n          Let's turn on the TV.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

The\n          first sighting was made by an Air\n          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan\n          to New York as the unidentified\n          crafts entered Mexico City air\n          space.  They were not detected by\n          radar by either country.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          The crazies were right.\n\nBeat.

This is very important. \n          Everything people have written\n          about in science books is going to\n          change.  The history of the world's\n          future is on the TV right now.

He\nfinds one and reaches for the VCR.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.\n\nMorgan slams the tape marked \"Bay Watch\" into the VCR and\npresses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing\nactually.\n\nMorgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his\nfather and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. \nThe four of them stare at the television.\n\n                    TV ANCHOR\n          ...

FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT\n\nThe family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The\nSOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on\nthe television now.\n\nThe fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan\nis asleep on Graham's lap.

There are all different ways\n          you can tell that there's someone\n          really there watching out for us. \n          You see signs.  Sometimes they're\n          little ones.  You think of someone. \n          The phone rings.  They're on the\n          phone... Sometimes they're big,\n          like fourteen lights hovering over\n          Mexico City.\n              (beat)\n          Sure, there are a lot of people\n          watching this who think this could\n          be a bad thing.  But there are a\n          lot of people watching this, who\n          think it's a miracle.  A sign of\n          God's existence.  It's all in how\n          you look at things Merrill.\n              (beat)\n          What you have to decide is what\n          kind of person you are?  Are you\n          the type who believes in miracles\n          and looks for signs or are you the\n          kind who believes, things just\n          happen by chance?\n\nBeat.  Merrill is deep in thought.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I was at this party once.  I'm on a\n          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was\n          just sitting there, looking\n          beautiful and staring at me.  I go\n          to lean in and kiss her and I\n          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I\n          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff\n          it in my paper cup next to the sofa\n          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney\n          throws up all over herself.\n              (beat)\n          I knew the second it happened.  It\n          was a miracle.  I could have been\n          kissing her when she threw up. \n          That would have scarred me for\n          life.  I may never have recovered.\n\nMerrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights\n          are a miracle.\n\nGraham smiles.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          There you go.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (whispers)\n          So which type are you?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          Do you feel comforted?\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (whispers)\n          Yes.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          What does it matter then?\n\nThe two of them turn back to the silent screen of the\ntelevision.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          Do you know what Colleen's last\n          words were before they killed her?\n\nBeat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          She said, \"See\", and then her eyes\n          glazed a bit and she said... \"Tell\n          Merrill to swing away.\"\n\nMerrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at\nhis expression.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          Do you know why she said that?\n\nMerrill nods, \"No.\"\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          Because the nerve endings in her\n          brain were firing as she died, and\n          some random memory of us at one of\n          your baseball games popped into her\n          head.\n              (beat)\n          There is no one watching out for us\n          Merrill.

FAMILY ROOM - DAY\n\nGraham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is\nalone on the couch.  Alone in the room.\n\nHe looks to the television.  It's not there.\n\nGraham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes\nstop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the\nfamily room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.\n\nGraham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. \nGraham opens the\n\nCLOSET.\n\nMerrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the\ntelevision on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          For the kids protection.  All they\n          were doing was watching TV from\n          five a.m.  I felt like they were\n          getting obsessed like you said. \n          They should be playing furry, furry\n          rabbit or tea party or something\n          right?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What's furry, furry rabbit?\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (points)\n          That's a game isn't it?\n              (beat)\n          Anyway...\n              (points at the TV)\n          There's been some interesting\n          developments.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What time is it?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.\n\nBeat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight\nshot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          But they're not really gone.  We\n          just can't see them.  Early this\n          morning a bird flew right at the\n          area where the lights were hovering\n          last night.\n\nMerrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          It stopped dead in the air and fell\n          straight down.\n\nMerrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          They caught it on tape and they've\n          been playing it all morning.  They\n          found the bird.  His head crushed\n          in.  When you see the footage it\n          looks like the bird flew into a\n          wall in the sky.\n              (beat)\n          They think they have some invisible\n          shield thing going, like an optical\n          illusion.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          The bird could have had a heart\n          attack and crushed his head when he\n          fell.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Already thought of.  Two other\n          birds did the same thing an hour\n          later.  Not as dramatic.  They\n          lived.  But you could see they hit\n          something.\n\nGraham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different\neyes.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          They're still there hovering.  In\n          fact, some people think there's\n          more of them now.  All over the\n          place.  Over us even.\n              (beat)\n          And there's a theory about the crop\n          circles now.  They think it could\n          be some kind of landmark, visual\n          mapping system -- so they can\n          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense\n          doesn't it?\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\nWe are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,\nwhich is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large\ncross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.\n\nGraham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. \nHe towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.\n\nWE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY\nBEGINNING.\n\nThe backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A\nsingle tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of\nthe yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet\nhigh.\n\nThe crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them\nquietly.  Watching.\n\nBeat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE\nWINDOW.\n\nHe listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT\nROOM.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nGraham walks into the hall and looks in their room.\n\nMorgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have\nTIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.

Morgan puts the book\non his father's lap.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          It says they're probably very small\n          -- like my height -- because, as\n          their brains developed, there was\n          no use for physical development. \n          It says they're probably\n          vegetarians, because they would\n          have realized the benefits of such\n          a diet.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Who wrote this book?\n\nGraham looks on the back cover for a picture.

Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          There are pictures.\n\nBeat.  Morgan opens the tome.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of\n          the book --\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Bimboo?\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Dad.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I just asked his name.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          You had a tone.\n\nBeat.

They're\n          hostile.  They've used up the\n          resources on their planet and are\n          looking to harvest our planet next.\n\nMorgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A\nspace ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at\nit.  Beat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Looks a little like our house\n          doesn't it?\n\nMorgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.

It's on\nfire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three\nbodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.\n\nTHE PHONE RINGS.\n\nThe children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS\nDIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes\nthe book.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for\n          now.  Everybody in this house needs\n          to calm down and eat some fruit or\n          something.\n\nGraham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under\nhis arm and picks up the phone.\n\n                    PHONE VOICE\n          Father.\n\nTHROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL\nAGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Hello?\n\nNOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then\nslowly hangs it up.\n\nGraham walks down the hall to a small window.\n\nThe window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. \nGraham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we\nsee the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

We saw the roof of this house from the Hess\nhallway window.\n\nGraham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.\n\nBeat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.\n\nGraham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the\nhouse.  He looks in a side window.\n\nTHE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN\nCHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS\nUPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS\nTOTALLY WRECKED.\n\nGraham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He\ntakes two steps back towards the front of the house and the\nsafety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK\nparked to the side of the house.\n\nThere is someone sitting in it.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

He stares out\nthe windshield.  He is covered in sweat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Hello Ray.\n\nRAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.\n\nRay clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles\na yellow white.\n\nGraham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two\nlarge bags over flowing with clothes.\n\nGraham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the\nTWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What happened Ray?\n\nBeat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.\n\n                    RAY\n          I wrote your number down to call\n          you.  It's been sitting next to the\n          phone for six months.

I\n          ain't never fallen asleep driving\n          before.  And never since.  Most of\n          the ride home, there wasn't a car\n          insight in either direction.  If\n          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended\n          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It\n          had to happen at that right moment. \n          That certain ten-fifteen seconds\n          when I passed her walking.  It was\n          like it was meant to be.\n\nRay finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.\n\n                    RAY\n          I guess if this is the end of the\n          world, I'm screwed right?

It was sent to the\n          local news bureau there and\n          satellited to us a few minutes ago. \n          All initial opinions are; this is\n          genuine.\n\nTHE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.\n\n                    TV ANCHOR\n          What you are about to see, may\n          disturb you.\n\nMerrill sits up in his chair.\n\nTHE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO\nIMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE\nA BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING\nGLASS WINDOW.\n\nTHE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT\nTHE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.\n\nTHE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT\nTHROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A\nRECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED\nBIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE\nBACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.\n\nTHE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL\nAROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE\nDARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.\n\nThe chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a\nlittle towards the television screen.\n\nWE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE\nGLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL\nTO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE\nKITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. \nHE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.\n\nTHE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING\nINTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE\nIMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.\n\nTHE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Move children!

WE SEE A NARROW\nALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A\nSMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS\nDENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE\nBUILDING.\n\nWE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN\nPORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE\nLITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY\nDIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.\n\n                    BOY WITH HAT\n          Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras\n          de ai!

THE\nIMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.\n\nAND THEN WE SEE IT.\n\nTHE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-\nHUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE\nWALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.\n\nMerrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. \nThe closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE\nVIDEO.\n\nTHE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT\nREWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A\nFLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.\n\nTHE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE\nBUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL\nWITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.\n\nTHE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE\nNON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.\nIT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.\n\nMerrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL\nLIKE CREATURE.

Graham steps into Ray Reddy's\nkitchen.\n\nCabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned\nover.  The faucet is running full blast.\n\nGraham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is\nupside down and leaned up against the pantry door.\n\nTHE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD\nINSIDE THE PANTRY.\n\nGraham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the\nkitchen.\n\nHe leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry\ndoor WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET\nMOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS\nIT'S BEING WALKED ON.\n\nGraham can almost see the bottom of the door around the\nleaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. \nBeat.\n\nGraham takes two small steps closer.\n\nWhen he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry\ndoor.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS\nSHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES\nBACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Hello.\n\nTHE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (loud)\n          The police are here...

Don't\n          throw away your life son.\n\nBeat.\n\nGraham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the\nwood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see\nare the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the\npantry.  He's at too severe an angle.\n\nGraham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry\ndoor.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall\non a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer\nonto the floor.\n\nHe takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to\nthe door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife\nunderneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like\na mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT\nREFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. \nWE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE\nAND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE\nCAN'T SEE INTO.\n\nGraham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet\nfrom the door.  Beat.\n\nHe takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the\nslanted table.\n\nHe stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He\nrises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the\ncounter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets\nto the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.\n\nHe stays like that for a long time.  Beat.\n\nGraham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly\nacross the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He\nkneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the\nslanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,\nonly inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the\npantry.\n\nThere is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of\nthe pantry.  Nothing else.\n\nGraham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. \nParts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.\n\nTWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.\n\nGRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE\nHARD.\n\nFOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN\nFLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.\n\nGRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON\nTHE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.

STATION WAGON - DAY\n\nThe station wagon knocks over the \"Ray Reddy\" mailbox as it\nturns sharply onto the road.\n\nGraham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his\nright.\n\nTHE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.\n\nTwo black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon\ncomes to a fast stop.\n\nBeat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead\nof the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the\nroad.\n\nA BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.\n\nGraham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.\n\nGraham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY\nabove him.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          Douche bag.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

They would invade us using\n          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand\n          combat.  They wouldn't use their\n          technology or fight an airborne\n          battle, because they would know we\n          would eventually use nuclear\n          weapons and the planet would be\n          useless to them.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I'm sorry, what book is this?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Did they say what our chances would\n          be if they did invade?\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They said one of two things could\n          happen.  One, they fight and are\n          defeated and leave to return again\n          with full forces hundreds or even\n          thousands of years later.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What's two?\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They win.\n\nThe words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second\nstep of the stairs.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What do you think about the idea\n          that they don't like places near\n          water, and we might be safe from\n          them near a lake or something?\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Sounds made up.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          We can choose to believe it and\n          pack up and leave.\n              (beat)\n          Or we can stay here.

HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON\n\nWE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham\ninside the house, closing the window shutters in one room\nafter another.\n\nWE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.\n\nOUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is\nnot pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at\nus.  She is shivering.\n\nOUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill\ncarry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. \nHe's moving into the main house.\n\nMerrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around\ncarefully as he moves.\n\nPart of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses\nthe lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the\nfallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs\nencased in glass cases.\n\nThe glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has\ncracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.\n\nWe watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of\nclothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds\nwhat he's looking for.  A rake.\n\nMerrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. \nWith the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball\nin the other, he turns to face the crops.\n\nWE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS\nOBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.\n\nMerrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a\nbatter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front\nof him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out\ninto the distance high over the crops.  He throws the\nbaseball up in the air...\n\nMerrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move\nwith blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. \nAnd misses the ball.\n\nThe ball drops at Merrill's feet.\n\nWE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This\ntime his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick\nactually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.\n\nThe ball drops at Merrill's feet.\n\nWE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up\nand tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He\nrips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the\neye.\n\nThe baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.\n\nMerrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little\nheavy as he stares down at the ball.\n\nHe gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things\nand then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he\ndoes.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right\nleg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and\npower...\n\nTHE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS\nACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.\n\nThe ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...\nsail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.\n\nAfter a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It\nlands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It\ncleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe\nmore.\n\nWE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops\nthe wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He\npiles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts\nfor the porch.

CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nMorgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Come quick!\n\nTHE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.\n\nWE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE\nSEE THEM.\n\nThey appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the\ncloset.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.\n\nAll four stare at the television.\n\nON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH\nSUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED. \nOTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE\nIS PANIC IN THE AIR.\n\n                    TV ANCHOR\n          Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and\n          Jerusalem as the latest to confirm\n          the appearance of lights.  There\n          are lights in the skies over an\n          estimated two hundred and seventy\n          four cities.  That total could be\n          as high as four hundred within the\n          hour.\n\nTHE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME\nVIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN\nTWO \"V\" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They decided to show themselves.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They think these look like stages\n          immediately proceeding an attack\n          maneuver.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          It's like War of the Worlds.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They think it might happen all at\n          once.\n\nThe words silence everyone.

They watch the soldiers loading up onto\ntrucks on the television.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          Some guy had a sign that said it\n          was the end of the world.\n              (beat)\n          Nothing really bad is going to\n          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Don't worry.\n\nMorgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          You sure right?\n\nBeat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks\nback at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He\nturns back to the children.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          You know about signs Morgan?  Not\n          like the ones people write on. \n          It's like if you poured a glass of\n          milk and you dropped the glass by\n          mistake and broke it before you\n          could drink it.  Then you looked at\n          the milk carton and saw that the\n          milk was spoiled.  They're things\n          that happen by chance or luck, but\n          make you feel that someone's\n          watching out for you.\n\nThe children think it over.  Beat.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          I once had a bad dream and I\n          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the\n          table next to my bed and something\n          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a\n          picture of mom.  She was smiling. \n          It made me feel safe... You mean\n          like that?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Yeah, like that.\n              (beat)\n          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think\n          there's someone watching out for\n          us.

He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it\nin his mouth.  He swallows.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          This tastes so great.\n\nBo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham\nstuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows\nhard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.\n\nGraham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. \nMore tears fall.\n\nMorgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He\nleans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's\nfork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to\nhis other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.\n\nBeat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and\nhugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile\non Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's\nshoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the\ntable.  Beat.\n\nTHE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.\n\nEveryone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place\nsetting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED\nLIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.\n\nMerrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. \nHe gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out\nof the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and\ninto the hall.\n\nGraham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. \nHe turns it ON.\n\nBeat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A\nLOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. \nTHE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE\nSOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.\n\nGraham steps out into the hall.

It's the same\none we've looked out twice before.\n\nGraham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE\nHOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light\nbreeze.  Nothing seems wrong.\n\nGraham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on\ninto darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the\ntop of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.\n\nSOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.\n\nGraham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black\nforty feet away.  Graham goes very still.\n\nLINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE\nTRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. \nALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES\nMOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES\nTHEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET...

UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING\n\nMerrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts\nhammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer\nand quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.\n\nGraham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are\nstanding together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds\nMorgan's hand.\n\nGraham keeps hammering as he speaks.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Did I ever tell you what everyone\n          said when you were born, Bo?\n\nBo nods \"no\" lightly.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You came out of your momma and you\n          didn't even cry.  You just opened\n          your eyes and looked around at\n          everybody.  Your eyes were so big\n          and gorgeous, the ladies in the\n          room gasped.\n\nGraham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They literally gasped.\n              (Graham gasps like them)\n          Then they go, \"She's like an\n          angel.\"  They said, \"We've never\n          seen a baby so beautiful.\"\n\nGraham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill\nfinishes hammering.\n\nGraham goes over and picks up Bo.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          And you know what else happened?\n\nBo nods, \"no.\"\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          When they put you on the table to\n          clean you up, you looked at me and\n          smiled.  They say babies that young\n          can't smile... You smiled.\n\nGraham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair\nout of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.\n\nAll four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. \nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          Let's go down now.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

You just stared at each\n          other for the longest time and then\n          she said real soft, \"Hello Morgan,\n          I'm you momma, you look just like I\n          dreamed.\"\n\nGraham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.\n\nSCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.\n\nThe group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. \nThe BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.\n\nMerrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the\nceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in\nthe ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.

UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING\n\nGraham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is\nmovement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light\nright next to them.\n\nThe rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. \nThey watch as it begins to twitch and sway.\n\nThe springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door\nstarts to fall open.\n\nMerrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and\nreach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. \nThe door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few\nmore inches before Merrill stops it.\n\nGraham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns\nred with strain as something pushes down on the door.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          This is a very temporary solution.\n\nGraham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching\nfrom the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he\nis.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. \nA laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...\nnothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          How temporary?\n\nMerrill's face is a deep crimson.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Twenty-two seconds.\n\nGraham looks around again... the same things... the same\ntable... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the\ncloset.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed\non a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its\ntop is one foot from the ceiling.\n\nGraham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts\nrocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of\nits guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...\nThe thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still\nattached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches\ninto the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to\nMerrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a\nfew inches lower than Merrill's reach.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Let go.\n\nMerrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It\nconnects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The\ntrapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of\nthe bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to\nthe attic.\n\nMerrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds\nthe weight of the attic door.\n\nAfter a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as\nthe pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.\n\nIt opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet\ndoor with a THUD.\n\nThe attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. \nTHUD.\n\nThe closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges\nkeeping it upright.\n\nGraham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING\n\nTHE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.\n\nMorgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach\nunder the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO\nTHE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON\nTHE DOOR.\n\nTHUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR\nUPSTAIRS.\n\nGraham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes\nMorgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the\nhall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the\nstairs.\n\nANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - EVENING\n\nThe swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he\nenters the kitchen.\n\nGraham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and\nwaits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the\ntable against the swinging door.\n\nThey take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and\njam the rest underneath the table.\n\nGraham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at\nthe pile of furniture.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          This is going to do nothing.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          We have to go in the basement.\n\nGraham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a\ndarkened door at the bottom.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          There's no way out of there.\n\nBeat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated\n          Uncle Merrill's arm?\n\nTHUD.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Should we make a run for it out the\n          back?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They're right behind the door.\n\nMerrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to\nBo and Morgan who stand against the wall.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          He was only a year and half old.\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (to Graham)\n          What are you doing?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          He was trying to eat a second\n          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,\n          \"No.\"  He tried to take a bite, so\n          I grabbed it.\n\nTHUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and\nstares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I must have pulled his arm at an\n          awkward angle.  His elbow popped\n          right out of the socket.\n\nTHE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE\nCLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS\nHALL.\n\nWE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          He didn't scream or anything.  His\n          arm just flopped to his side and he\n          got real still.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          They're coming.\n\nGraham moves towards the basement stairs.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I held him in my lap in the back\n          seat as we drove to the hospital. \n          I couldn't stop crying... We need\n          to go into the basement now.\n\nGraham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan\nand Bo move to their father slowly.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You know what your Uncle Merrill\n          did right after the doctor put his\n          arm back in place?  He jumped off\n          the table and gave me a hug.  He\n          had already forgotten that I was\n          the one who hurt him.\n\nGraham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for\nMerrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks\ntoward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          We won't be able to get out of\n          there.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.\n\nBeat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at\nhis older brother.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I know.\n\nMerrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He\nwatches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against\nit.  Beat.\n\nTHERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.\n\nThe door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS\nBEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A\nCHALK BOARD.\n\nWE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE\nFROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BASEMENT - EVENING\n\nGraham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          We forgot our foil helmets!\n\nGraham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          We need something to wedge against\n          the doorknob.\n\nThe basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are\ncluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,\ncleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill\nrummages through the shelves frantically.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They'll read our minds!\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You're scaring your sister.\n\n                    BO\n          I'm already scared.\n\nGraham puts his ear to the door and listens.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Merrill --\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I'm looking!\n\nMerrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking\nthings to the ground.\n\n                    MORGAN\n              (to himself)\n          They'll know our secret thoughts.\n\nThere is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. \nGraham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push\nopen.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Merrill!\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Got it!\n\nMerrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a\npick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. \nIt has a three-foot wooden handle.\n\nMerrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.\n\nA single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is\nthe only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB\nwith the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.\n\nTHE BULB SHATTERS.\n\nTHE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.\n\n                    BO\n          Dad!\n\nWE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING\nAT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.\n\nCLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.\n\nIT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL\nSHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.\n\nTHE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL\nAND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.\n\nMORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED\nBETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A\nLITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.\n\nTHE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO\nLESSEN.\n\nBeat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S\nFACE.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Where's Bo?\n\nTHE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,\nBETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING\nBEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S\nHEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.\n\n                    BO\n          I'm okay.\n\nANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES\nWITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE\nSHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.\n\nHIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.\n\nHe turns the knob to \"on.\"  The radio lights up, but no sound\nemerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob\nand checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He\nlistens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          What's happening out there?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (in the dark)\n          I can't even imagine.\n\nTHEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          I hope they're doing better than we\n          are.  We don't even have helmets.\n\nTHERE IS A LOUD BANG.\n\nBOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME\nTO A STOP ON THE DOOR.\n\nANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN\nHANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.\n\nBANG.\n\nGRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door\nand then turns and faces the lights.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They're just making noises. \n          They're not trying to get in.\n              (beat)\n          Why are they doing that?\n\nGraham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan\nmoves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          They want our attention on the\n          door?\n\nBANG.  A beat of silence.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They're distracting us?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          From what?\n\n                    MORGAN\n          The book says they're probably very\n          good problem solvers.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          What book!\n\n                    MORGAN\n          They'll find a way in.\n\nBANG.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Morgan, give me your flashlight.\n\nMorgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS\nTHE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN\nGLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.\n\nTHE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it\nup.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Is there an air vent in here?\n\nMerrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.\n\nThey aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The\nbrothers move in opposite directions.\n\nGRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE\nCEILING AS HE MOVES.\n\nMERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT\nPEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.\n\nA BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.\n\nMerrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I can feel air.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Me too.\n\nTHE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          It's getting stronger.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I'm close.\n\nBANG.\n\nTHE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND\nMERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME\nTO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.\n\nHE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE\nTWO LIGHTS.\n\n                    MORGAN\n          What?\n\nIN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM\nA BREEZE.\n\nGRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR\nVENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.\n\nEYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET\nOF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN\nTHE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.\n\nMORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S\nA DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.\n\nWE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.\n\n                    MERRILL (O.S.)\n          Hold the vent!\n\nSOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING\nFACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Pull him!\n\nTHE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS\nBO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.\n\nBO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE\nTHERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG\nFOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER\nWITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY\nMOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.\n\nBO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN\nENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP\nOF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH\nANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF\nTHE REST.\n\nMERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD\nAND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS\nON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS\nAN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.\n\nMerrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his\nside and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM\nAROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.\n\nHE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS\nBACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S\nFACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS\nLIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.\n\nGRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          We don't have his medicine.\n\nMerrill looks at his nephew turning gray.\n\nGraham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the\nchild's ear.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow\n          it down together.  Feel my chest. \n          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe\n          like me.  Breathe like me.\n\nMorgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain\nand panic.\n\n                    BO\n          He can't breathe.\n\nBo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.\n\nGraham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks\ninto Morgan's ear.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I\n          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...\n          It'll pass.\n\nGraham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Don't do this to me again.  Not\n          again.\n\nMerrill stares at his brother's desperate face.\n\nGraham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on\nGraham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength\nthey have.\n\nGraham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up\nwith water.\n\nGraham's eyes close.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I hate you.  I hate you...\n\nGraham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          The fear is feeding it... Don't be\n          afraid of what's happening...\n          Believe it's going to pass...\n          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be\n          afraid... The air is coming...\n          Believe... We don't have to be\n          afraid... It's about to pass...\n          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...\n          Here comes the air...\n\nA THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE\nSOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          There we go... We don't have to be\n          scared at all... We know it'll\n          pass.  We believe it... Don't be\n          afraid Morgan.\n\nMorgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.\n\nTHE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR\nTHROUGH A STRAW.\n\nMerrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his\nson.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. \n          Together... The air is going in our\n          lungs... Together... We're the\n          same.  We're the same.\n\nMerrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with\nGraham's.\n\nTHE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO\nLABORED BREATHS.\n\nGraham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          I hate you.\n\nMorgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as\nfather and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each\nother tight.\n\nTHE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED\nFACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE\nBASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST\nIN THEIR THOUGHTS.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I should save the flashlights.\n\nBeat.  Graham nods without looking over.\n\nMERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF\nLIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY\nDISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.\n\nMerrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in\nher hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE\nHER AND MERRILL.\n\nMerrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the\nbutton.\n\nTHE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.  BASEMENT - MORNING\n\nWE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. \nIT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.\n\n                    VOICE\n          ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and\n          Bahrain have also confirmed.\n\nGraham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT\nOF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.\n\nMerrill steps into his vision.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          I found a pack of light bulbs.\n\nMerrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE\nVOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF\nTHE RADIO.\n\n                    RADIO VOICE\n          ... Parts of China and Northern\n          Korea are among the few remaining\n          to verify withdrawals.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          They're broadcasting...\n\n                    MERRILL\n          It came on about two hours ago. \n          Woke me up.\n              (beat)\n          We won Graham.\n\nMerrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          It went on all night.  Everywhere. \n          It was completely a ground battle. \n          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see\n          them unless you're up close.  A lot\n          of people died.  Some from combat. \n          But most from poison gas\n          inhalation.  They secrete it.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          How many died?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          They think over a hundred thousand. \n          They're just estimates.\n              (beat)\n          But we held strong.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          How do they know it's over?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          A mass evacuation by them started\n          about eight o'clock this morning. \n          It's eleven now.\n              (beat)\n          They're leaving.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          You didn't think we'd make it.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          No.\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (low voice)\n          Listen, there's things I can take\n          and a couple things I can't and one\n          of them I can't take, is when my\n          older brother --\n              (voice cracks)\n          -- who is everything I want to be,\n          starts losing faith in things.

He looks shaken.  Graham stares at\nthe conviction in his younger brother's expression.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          Okay.\n\nBeat.\n\nTHERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham\nand Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on\nMerrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. \nHe still looks grey.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          He's been like that for awhile.  We\n          need to get him some medicine.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Have they said anything about our\n          area?\n\n                    MERRILL\n          Philadelphia and its outlying\n          counties are cleared, but who knows\n          for sure?\n\nGraham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham\nturns to Merrill.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (whispers)\n          He's not strong enough to fight off\n          another attack.\n\n                    MERRILL\n              (whispers)\n          I know.\n              (beat)\n          We need to be sure, before we open\n          that door Graham.\n\nThe two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. \nGraham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across\nthe room towards him.\n\nMerrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's\nside.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.\n\nGraham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. \nBeat.\n\nHe turns it ON.\n\nA SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE\nWAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. \nTHERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY\nELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.\n\nGraham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.\n\n                    MERRILL\n          That's good enough for me.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Me too.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Merrill\nopens it all the way.\n\nDUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.\n\nMerrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top\nand looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the\nbottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.\n\nGraham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in\nhis arms.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING\n\nTHE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS\nOF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN\nTHE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.\n\nTHE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.\n\nWE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.\n\nGraham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the\ntoppled chairs to get to the cabinets.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Get the syringe as well.  We might\n          need to give him an epinephrine\n          shot.\n\nMerrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that\nhave fallen from the cabinets.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING\n\nSHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM\nWHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.\n\nGraham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.\n\nWE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE\nFRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.\n\nBo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.\n\n                    BO\n          People are dancing.\n\nShe points at the closet.\n\nMorgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at\nhim.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You want to see it?\n\nMorgan nods, \"yes\" as he struggles to breathe.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I'll bring the TV in here.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

The screen goes black.\n\nBo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and\nthe television cart out into the hall.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING\n\nGraham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful\nnot to trip it on the carpet.\n\nTHE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.\n\nGraham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN\nREFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.\n\nTHE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE\nTELEVISION SCREEN.\n\nThe TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on\neither side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. \nHis back is to the family room.\n\nGraham straightens and turns around slowly.\n\nMorgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's\nface turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.\n\nFor a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we\nsee the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.\n\nThere is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the\nmiddle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on\nthe shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,\nit almost disappears.\n\nIt blinks.\n\nGraham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the\nfront hall.\n\nMerrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the\nfamily room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a\nstop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his\nhand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and\nMerrill in the middle of the family room.\n\nMorgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.\n\nThe lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the\ncreature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.\n\nGraham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES\nFINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.\n\nThe creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its\nfingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY\nCHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.\n\nA small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS\nTO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.\n\nGraham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of\nthe creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.\n\nGRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS\nTO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.\n\nGRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.\n\nWE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION\nIN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          He's reading my --\n\nTHE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.

WE\nREALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE\nOF THE ROAD.\n\nThe car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is\nopen.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A\npriest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black\nshirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.\n\nWe are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE\nLIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered\namongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.\n\nA large group of officers and workers hover around a green\ntruck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.\n\nOfficer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers\nsomething into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he\napproaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men\nlook at each other.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          What do you know?\n\nGraham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          There was an accident.  Drunk\n          driving.  They weren't sure.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell\n          asleep at the wheel.\n\nOfficer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the\nambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His\narms rest on his bent knees.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Is he okay?\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          Yes... That's the first thing\n          Colleen asked too.\n\nGraham smiles a little smile.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          She's talking... Which ambulance is\n          she in?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          She's not in an ambulance Father.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Why not?\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off\n          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and\n          then a tree.  She was pinned\n          between the two.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Pinned?  What does that mean?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          The truck... the truck has severed\n          most of her lower half.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          What did you say?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          She won't be saved.  At this point\n          she's alive, because the truck is\n          holding her together.  She doesn't\n          feel much, and she's talking almost\n          like normal.  We didn't pull the\n          truck out, cause we wanted you to\n          come down here to be with her, as\n          long as she's awake.  That won't be\n          very long.\n              (beat)\n          Father, you understand what I've\n          told you?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Edgar.\n              (he starts crying)\n          Is this the last time I'm going to\n          talk to my wife?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    OFFICER PASKI\n          Yes it is.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n\nThe other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He\nwalks on, unaware of the stares.\n\nHe slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It\nsticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the\nside of the vehicle.\n\nCOLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight\nbrown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over\nthe front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests\non her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back\nis against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the\ntruck.\n\nShe's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up\nto her.  She is shivering slightly.\n\n                    COLLEEN\n              (soft)\n          Hi sweetie.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Hi baby.\n\nGraham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked\nblankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the\ntwisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.\n\n                    COLLEEN\n          I was just taking a walk before\n          dinner.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          You love walks.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    COLLEEN\n          I guess it was meant to be.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Does it hurt?\n\n                    COLLEEN\n          I don't feel much.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Good.\n\nGraham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts\ncrying with her.\n\n                    COLLEEN\n              (crying)\n          ...

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS\nFADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.\n\nTHE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING\nRELEASED.\n\nTHE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS\nFACE.\n\nTHE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN\nWINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM\nAND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON\nTABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.\n\nGraham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (soft)\n          Swing away, Merrill.\n\nMorgan's face is obscured by gas.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (loud)\n          Merrill.\n\nMerrill turns and looks to Graham.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          Swing away.\n\nGraham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye\nline to the baseball bat mounted above him.\n\nBeat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting\nplace.\n\nThe creature starts to move.\n\nMerrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks\nforward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.\n\nThe creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its\nlines and colors don't match in position in the room.\n\nMerrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn\nwith staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through\nthe air of the family room... Contact.\n\nThe creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball\nbat.\n\nMorgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room\nin an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop\nlifelessly to the carpet.\n\nThe creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is\nthe BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. \nThe creature falls to the ground.\n\nGraham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham\npicks up his son's limp body in his arms.\n\nThe creature moves to its feet.\n\nMerrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on\nfire.\n\nGraham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine\non the ground.\n\nMerrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles\npull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with\nthe creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back\ninto the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH\nONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's\nskin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.\n\nBo and Graham look up.\n\nTHE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS\nINTO A POWDERY WHITE.\n\nMerrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They\nstare at each other with sudden realization.\n\nMerrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places\nall over the family room.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

FAMILY ROOM - MORNING\n\nMerrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS\nTHROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The\ncreature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of\nwater crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER\nHIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. \nParts of its body are still changing and matching its\nenvironment.  Parts are white.\n\nThe creature stands again.\n\nMerrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to\nthe dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon\ncheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.\n\nMerrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.

THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES\nTHE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF\nTHE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.\n\nTHE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. \nIT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS\nON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.\n\nTHE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S\nGLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL...
