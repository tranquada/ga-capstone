The\nbackyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn\nfrom use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a\npicnic table.\n\nThe backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. \nSix feet high.\n\nEverything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A\n<b>CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.

Beat.\n\nHe relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up\nsweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He\nputs it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his\nbedroom.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

It's\nghostly stained forever on the blank wall.\n\n<b>A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.\n</b>\nThe water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the\ndoorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very\nstill.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\nThe bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his\nchildren's room.  There are children's books everywhere. \nOverflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.\n\nGraham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both\nempty.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n<b>WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.

He is hyper-awake. \nMerrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His\nmuscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and\nlooks around bewildered.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

She is in her nightgown.  She is four.\n\nThey reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. \nHer hair is messed from sleep.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          Bo where's Morgan?\n\nBO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.

He's\nclose.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.\n\nHe finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his\npajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          Morgan what's happening?\n\nGraham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of\nMorgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.\n\nGraham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's\nlooking straight at him.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          Are... you... hurt?\n\nBeat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.\n\n<b>                    MORGAN\n</b>          I think God did it.\n\nBeat.

Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham\nsees something.\n\nGraham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving\nforward towards something.\n\nHe walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a\nclearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. \nThey are clearly agitated.\n\nGraham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING\n<b>FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED\n</b><b>FEET WIDE.\n</b>\nGraham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the\ncenter.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.\n\nThe dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL\n<b>THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF\n</b><b>THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.\n</b>\n<b>WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE\n</b><b>HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,\n</b><b>UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.\n</b>\n<b>LEGEND:\n</b>\n<b>               \"BUCKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA...\n</b><b>             THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA\"\n</b>\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

It\n          would take the strangeness away if\n          we knew it was Lionel and the\n          Wolfington brothers just messing\n          around...\n              (beat, listens)\n          The movies...\n              (beat)\n          Are you sure?\n              (beat)\n          Okay, then... Thank you for your\n          patience Lee.\n\nGraham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the\ncounter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen\nfloor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a\nLARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.\n\n<b>                    MORGAN\n</b>          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.\n\nGraham looks at the majestic dog.

I'll call Dr.\n          Reynolds.\n\nMorgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on\ntheir faces.\n\nGraham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the\npuddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his\nknees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down\nthe hall.\n\nA balding police officer stands on the other side of the\nscreen door.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          That was quick Edgar.

He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,\nbefore walking over to Houdini.\n\nThe two children sit down in the grass with the dog.\n\nBo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. \nShe stops.

She is\nnot pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at\nus.  She is shivering.\n\nOUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill\ncarry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. \nHe's moving into the main house.\n\nMerrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around\ncarefully as he moves.\n\nPart of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses\nthe lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the\nfallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs\nencased in glass cases.\n\nThe glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has\ncracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.\n\nWe watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of\nclothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds\nwhat he's looking for.  A rake.\n\nMerrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. \nWith the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball\nin the other, he turns to face the crops.\n\n<b>WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS\n</b><b>OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.\n</b>\nMerrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a\nbatter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front\nof him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out\ninto the distance high over the crops.  He throws the\nbaseball up in the air...\n\nMerrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move\nwith blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. \nAnd misses the ball.\n\nThe ball drops at Merrill's feet.\n\nWE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This\ntime his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick\nactually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.\n\nThe ball drops at Merrill's feet.\n\nWE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up\nand tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He\nrips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the\neye.\n\nThe baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.\n\nMerrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little\nheavy as he stares down at the ball.\n\nHe gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things\nand then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he\ndoes.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right\nleg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and\npower...\n\n<b>THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS\n</b><b>ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.\n</b>\nThe ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...\nsail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.\n\nAfter a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It\nlands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It\ncleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe\nmore.\n\nWE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops\nthe wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He\npiles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts\nfor the porch.

The door\nstarts to fall open.\n\nMerrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and\nreach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. \nThe door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few\nmore inches before Merrill stops it.\n\nGraham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns\nred with strain as something pushes down on the door.\n\n<b>                    MERRILL\n</b>          This is a very temporary solution.\n\nGraham brings his arms down.

There is a very small table with photos against a wall. \nA laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...\nnothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          How temporary?\n\nMerrill's face is a deep crimson.\n\n<b>                    MERRILL\n</b>          Twenty-two seconds.\n\nGraham looks around again... the same things... the same\ntable... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the\ncloset.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed\non a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its\ntop is one foot from the ceiling.\n\nGraham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts\nrocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of\nits guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...\nThe thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still\nattached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches\ninto the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to\nMerrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a\nfew inches lower than Merrill's reach.\n\n<b>                    GRAHAM\n</b>          Let go.\n\nMerrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It\nconnects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The\ntrapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of\nthe bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to\nthe attic.\n\nMerrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds\nthe weight of the attic door.\n\nAfter a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as\nthe pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.\n\nIt opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet\ndoor with a THUD.\n\nThe attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. \n<b>THUD.\n</b>\nThe closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges\nkeeping it upright.\n\nGraham moves down the stairs.

Four police cars are scattered\namongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.\n\nA large group of officers and workers hover around a green\ntruck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.\n\nOfficer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.

Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting\nplace.\n\nThe creature starts to move.\n\nMerrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks\nforward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.\n\nThe creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its\nlines and colors don't match in position in the room.\n\nMerrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn\nwith staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through\nthe air of the family room... Contact.\n\nThe creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball\nbat.\n\nMorgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room\nin an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop\nlifelessly to the carpet.\n\nThe creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is\nthe BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. \nThe creature falls to the ground.\n\nGraham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham\npicks up his son's limp body in his arms.\n\nThe creature moves to its feet.\n\nMerrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on\nfire.\n\nGraham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine\non the ground.\n\nMerrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles\npull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with\nthe creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back\ninto the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH\nONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's\nskin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.\n\nBo and Graham look up.\n\n<b>THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS\n</b><b>INTO A POWDERY WHITE.\n</b>\nMerrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.

Bo's glasses of\nwater crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER\nHIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. \nParts of its body are still changing and matching its\nenvironment.  Parts are white.\n\nThe creature stands again.\n\nMerrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to\nthe dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon\ncheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.\n\nMerrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.
