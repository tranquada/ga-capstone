ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY\n\n               Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on \n               end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end \n               in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.\n\n               We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products \n               calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is \n               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been \n               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica \n               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, \n               in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat \n               red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE \n               WHITE BACKGROUND.\n\n                                        MOONSTRUCK\n\n               Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low \n               TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.\n\n                                     ZITO'S VOICE\n                              (barely discernable)\n                         Three times they cancel the order \n                         with me, and three times they come \n                         back. Who they kidding? They cheap, \n                         cheap, cheap. The other bread they \n                         get is no good. They save pennies. \n                         Everybody complain and they come \n                         back. \"Zito, your bread is the best.\" \n                         They're like children stupid in school \n                         who cannot learn. The water. It's \n                         the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, \n                         you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water \n                         is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask \n                         your father. He knows.\n\n               During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE \n               DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently \n               with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the \n               pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.\n\n               NOW WE SEE ZITO\n\n               He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's \n               early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, \n               so he's a little tired and disgruntled.\n\n                                     ZITO\n                         You want me to make you some coffee?\n\n               NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\n               She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is \n               Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked \n               with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes \n               of a dark color.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         What d'you know about coffee? Gimme \n                         a loaf of bread.\n\n               EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY\n\n               Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping \n               satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She \n               moves off briskly.\n\n               EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY\n\n               This is a little Italian funeral parlor.\n\n               INT. THE \"WAKE\" ROOM\"\n\n               A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, \n               many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, \n               the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and \n               formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We \n               discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.\n\n               She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over \n               and says.\n\n                                     OLD WOMAN\n                         He looks great.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         That Al Conti is a genius.\n\n               INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR\n\n               First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO \n               CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.\n\n                                     CONTI'S VOICE\n                         I am a genius.\n\n               The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half \n               cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming \n               mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's \n               tabulations.\n\n                                     LORETTA'S VOICE\n                         If you're such an artistic genius, \n                         why can't you keep track of your \n                         receipts? How am I going to do your \n                         income tax?\n\n                                     CONTI'S VOICE\n                         I am an artistic genius.\n\n               The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta \n               sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of \n               coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering \n               figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         If you're an artistic genius, how \n                         come you got butter on your tie?\n\n               He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Give it here. I'll give you this, \n                         Al, you make good coffee.\n\n               She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has \n               taken off, and slams the ledger shut.\n\n               INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL\n\n               We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They \n               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall \n               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes \n               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is \n               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. \n               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, \n               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that \n               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a \n               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. \n               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something \n               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and\n\n               INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY\n\n               WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.\n\n               Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping \n               block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, \n               unskinned.\n\n               INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY\n\n               A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the \n               FLORIST'S VOICE.\n\n                                     FLORIST'S VOICE\n                         Red roses. Very romantic. The man \n                         who sends these knows what he's doing.\n\n               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the \n               box of roses.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         The man who sends those spends a lot \n                         of money on something that ends up \n                         in the garbage can.\n\n               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.\n\n                                     FLORIST\n                         I'm glad everybody ain't like you, \n                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Without me, you'd be out of business. \n                         I like flowers.\n\n               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first \n               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of \n               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red \n               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.\n\n               END OF CREDITS\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n               A red neon sign hangs in the window.\n\n               It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A \n               YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested \n               in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.\n\n               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\n\n               White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the \n               door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because \n               they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles \n               along pleasantly.\n\n               MUSIC\n\n               A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.\n\n               MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.\n\n               They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is \n               Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is \n               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens \n               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a \n               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a \n               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is \n               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked \n               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and \n               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.\n\n               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who \n               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.\n\n               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she \n               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.\n\n               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their \n               order.\n\n                                     BOBO\n                         Are you ready?\n\n                                     MR.

There's a \n               big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella \n               stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is \n               littered with boots.

He's wearing \n               a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue \n               slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, \n               once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes \n               in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying \n               fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside \n               a lit fringed lamp.

THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.\n\n               It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an \n               overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black \n               Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he \n               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and \n               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man \n               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.\n\n               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.\n\n               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and \n               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective \n               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the \n               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.\n\n               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears \n               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN\n\n               Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of \n               satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around \n               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread \n               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.\n\n               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula \n               flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the \n               cooked side.\n\n               Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in \n               the bread.\n\n               The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, \n               scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.\n\n               A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash \n               of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results \n               from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.\n\n               Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin \n               table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the \n               big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled \n               coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes \n               toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a \n               nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.\n\n               As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work \n               shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As \n               Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, \n               who's at the stove.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Will you live here?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         No.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Why not?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Pop don't like Johnny.\n\n               Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours.\n\n               Then she takes the pot back to the stove.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         So we'll sell the house.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         I got married before, you didn't \n                         sell.\n\n               Loretta comes to the table.

He's in a very good mood. He's \n               WHISTLING. He laughs to himself.\n\n               CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY\n\n               And the street in front of it. Loretta arrives. She's wearing \n               a long, navy-blue cloth coat and a knit hat. She looks up at \n               the sign and at the business card in her hand, and enters \n               the shop.\n\n               INT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY\n\n               It's a nice Italian bake shop. Three Italian women, CHRISSY, \n               BARBARA, and MA wait on THREE WOMEN SHOPPERS at the counter.\n\n               CHRISSY and BARBARA are in their late 20's or early 30's; MA \n               is old, old. Loretta comes in and speaks to CHRISSY.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Is Ronny Cammareri here?\n\n                                     CHRISSY\n                         He down at the ovens.

CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY\n\n               Chrissy comes out and Loretta follows. They walk around to \n               an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk. Chrissy \n               shouts down.\n\n                                     CHRISSY\n                         Hey, RONNY.\n\n               EXT. AN OLD DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE - DAY\n\n               The door slides open, revealing ROCCO, a baker missing a few \n               teeth. He is surrounded by bread.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         What!\n\n                                     CHRISSY'S VOICE\n                         Somebody to see Ronny.\n\n               Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta \n               make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters \n               shut behind them.\n\n               INT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY\n\n               There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the \n               room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And \n               various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., \n               scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.\n\n               PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long \n               wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.\n\n               Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking \n               bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked \n               with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, \n               and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, \n               handsome and intense.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Ronny!\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         What!\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Somebody here to see you.\n\n               Ronny turns and takes in Loretta.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Have you come from my brother?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Why?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         I'm going to marry him.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         You are going to marry my brother?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Yes.

What is life?\n\n               He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         I didn't come here to upset you.\n\n               Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, \n               turns them around, and slides them back in.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         They say bread is life.

Johnny \n                         came in here, he ordered bread from \n                         me. I put it in the slicer and I \n                         talked with him and my hand got caught \n                         cause I wasn't paying attention. The \n                         slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny \n                         'cause - when my fianc\u00e9 saw that I \n                         was maimed, she left me for another \n                         man.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         That's the bad blood between you and \n                         Johnny?\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         That's it.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         But that wasn't Johnny's fault.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         I don't care! I ain't no freakin \n                         monument to justice! I lost my hand, \n                         I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, \n                         Johnny has his bride! You come in \n                         here and you want me to put away my \n                         heartbreak and forget?\n\n               He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with \n               bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Is it just a matter of time till a \n                         man opens his eyes and gives up his \n                         one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe. \n                         All I have... Have you come here, \n                         Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to \n                         take these last few loaves from my \n                         table? Alright. Alright.\n\n               The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away, \n               to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a \n               single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.\n\n               Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy \n               approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.\n\n                                     CHRISSY\n                         This is the most tormented man I \n                         have ever known. I am in love with \n                         this man. He doesn't know that. I \n                         never told him cause he can never \n                         love anybody since he lost his hand \n                         and his girl.\n\n               She holds out the knife.\n\n                                     CHRISSY\n                         Here. Why don't you just kill him? \n                         It would be so much more kind than \n                         coming here and inviting him to a \n                         wedding like he'll never have.\n\n               Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do, \n               and goes to the flour room.\n\n               INT. OF THE FLOUR ROOM - DAY\n\n               Many 50 lb. bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric \n               bulb. A rough stone staircase opposite is lit by daylight \n               from above. Ronny, quietly distraught, stands leaning by his \n               forehead against a stack of flour. Loretta approaches him. \n               She feels for him.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Where you live?\n\n               He points to the stone staircase.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Upstairs.\n\n               She touches his shoulder.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Come on.\n\n               He follows her up the stairs.\n\n               EXT. THE STAIRCASE ENTRANCE ON THE STREET\n\n               Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the \n               apartment building behind the bakery.\n\n               INT. THE PEACOCK CAFE \u0097 DAY\n\n               It's a dark Italian coffee and dessert house. Reproductions \n               of Roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves. In the back is \n               a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the \n               case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is \n               almost empty.\n\n               MUSIC\n\n               An album of \"NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS\" is PLAYING on the cafe's \n               SOUND SYSTEM.\n\n               The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall, \n               DISCOVERING busts of Romans occasionally, and then IT COMES \n               TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is \n               inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.\n\n               DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE\n\n               At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with \n               MONA, his girlfriend.

Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme \n               poster.

Now he stands \n               up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their \n               midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man \n               walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the \n               empty place in front of him, a little sad.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         My father needs a plate.\n\n               Rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front \n               of the Old Man. He immediately, methodically begins to fill \n               his new plate. Rose goes to her place and sits down.\n\n                                     RAYMOND\n                         Cosmo.

But one \n                         time I woke up in the middle of the \n                         night cause this bright light was in \n                         my face. Like a flashlight.

I never seen the moon so \n                         big before or since. I was almost \n                         scared, like it was gonna crush the \n                         house. And I looked down, and standing \n                         there in the street was Cosmo, looking \n                         up at the windows. This is the funny \n                         part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I \n                         thought you brought this big moon \n                         over to my house cause you were so \n                         in love and woke me up with it.

Raymond \n               wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and \n               excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect.\n\n                                     RAYMOND\n                         Rita.

THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Over the house is still the great big full moon. The front \n               door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs.\n\n               The Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking \n               a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume \n               of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the \n               street.\n\n               EXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT\n\n               The moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it \n               and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water.\n\n               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the \n               Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up \n               from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         Alright now. Howl. Howl.\n\n               The Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration, \n               howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They \n               do nothing. He howls at the moon again.\n\n               The Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until \n               WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on \n               it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now, \n               cries out.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         How long must I wait? Quanto tempo \n                         devo aspettare!\n\n               The Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter \n               he is, laughs and laughs.\n\n               EXT.

CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY\n\n               Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue \n               icing to a wedding cake.

A CHURCH BASEMENT\n\n               It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels \n               of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game \n               of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of \n               the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- \n               we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.\n\n                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE\n                         I've got a lot on my mind. Things \n                         are getting bad in my house. My \n                         daughter-in-law is mad at my son \n                         because he will not pay for the \n                         wedding.\n\n               A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER\n\n               An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it \n               with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand \n               belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old \n               Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives \n               a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.\n\n               Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips \n               it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy \n               goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray \n               where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the \n               Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever \n               to drive the stake into the apple.

The last stack is topped with a filled \n               out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a \n               night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a \n               ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The \n               CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for \n               her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees \n               Rita.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Bye, Aunt Rita.\n\n                                     RITA\n                         Bye, bye, honey.

THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY\n\n               Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA \n               BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if \n               anybody's looking, and goes in.\n\n               WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles \n               appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back \n               into the store.\n\n               INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY\n\n               WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with \n               BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little \n               bored.\n\n                                     BONNIE\n                         So?

This music should convey that Loretta is \n               turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful \n               coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and \n               gets very excited.\n\n                                     BONNIE\n                         I've been wanting to do this for \n                         three years! Let me show you some \n                         magazines! You've got to get a \n                         manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila! \n                         I'm gonna need help!\n\n               SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get \n               very excited and start showing Loretta and each other \n               magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do, \n               leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with \n               her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails.\n\n               A MONTAGE FOLLOWS\n\n               They're plucking her eyebrows.\n\n               They're cutting and dying her hair.\n\n               They're painting her nails.\n\n               EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY\n\n               Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much \n               more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if \n               she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly\n\n               EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY\n\n               Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.\n\n               EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY\n\n               A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in \n               the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.\n\n               She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.\n\n               INT. INSINUATION - DAY\n\n               Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer \n               is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta \n               greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey \n               what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she \n               wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.\n\n               There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various \n               dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some \n               incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in \n               a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her \n               because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the \n               dress that she ultimately does buy.\n\n               EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK\n\n               Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away \n               down the street.\n\n               WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL \n               SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops \n               and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and \n               stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.\n\n               Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, \n               bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology, \n               and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop \n               window.\n\n               END OF MUSIC\n\n               THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.\n\n               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK\n\n               Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off \n               her coat, calls.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.\n\n               A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks \n               up.\n\n               A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS\n\n               Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens \n               the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch \n               on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated \n               way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.\n\n               LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM\n\n               She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There \n               are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.\n\n               LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE\n\n               Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on \n               nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing \n               antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.\n\n               She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she \n               picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and \n               then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair. \n               Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums. \n               She selects one and puts it on.\n\n               MUSIC\n\n               Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with \n               herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her \n               blouse.\n\n               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA \n               SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE \n               FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on \n               her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. \n               WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening \n               dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The \n               evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses \n               the mirror.\n\n               WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR\n\n               In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.\n\n               EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT\n\n               The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the \n               night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.\n\n               But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge \n               white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights \n               burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along \n               the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the\n\n               MUSIC PLAYS\n\n               END OF MUSIC\n\n               EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT\n\n               LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV\n\n               CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created \n               by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled \n               with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand \n               and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. \n               Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, \n               inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous \n               color.\n\n               LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN\n\n               The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.\n\n               She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights \n               up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger \n               jets.\n\n               Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher \n               into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her \n               eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, \n               like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.\n\n               FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER\n\n               Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for \n               its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing \n               quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite \n               side of the fountain, is Ronny.\n\n               He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and \n               topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises \n               a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles \n               brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and \n               starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the \n               fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her \n               attempt at composure from, Ronny.\n\n               Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around \n               the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         You look beautiful.

He hands \n               her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns \n               and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.\n\n               He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Thank you!\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         For what?\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         I don't know.

You know it's \n                         been a long time since I've been to \n                         the Opera.\n\n               His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts \n               to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         So. Where are we sitting?\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Come on.\n\n               He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and \n               go into the house.\n\n               THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES\n\n               The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished \n               pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are \n               in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.\n\n               Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, \n               John. They are seated and people are looking at them.\n\n               Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, \n               something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing \n               good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes \n               her look like a big piece of hard candy.\n\n               Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row \n               of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.\n\n               They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.\n\n               THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV\n\n               The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into \n               the dark as the house lights go down.\n\n               WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND\n\n               Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Here we go.\n\n               As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR \n               takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to \n               the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.\n\n               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\n\n               The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then \n               FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter \n               the restaurant.\n\n               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\n\n               The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.\n\n               The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.\n\n               She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly \n               approaches her. She's very dignified.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         It's just me. I want to eat.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         I got a table for you right now.\n\n               Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         This alright?\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Fine.\n\n               He seats her.\n\n                                     JIMMY\n                         Enjoy your meal.\n\n               Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the \n               wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, \n               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, \n               is having an argument with the man across from her.\n\n               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and \n               the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's \n               table.\n\n                                     BOBO\n                         Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You \n                         eating alone tonight?\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a \n                         martini, no ice and two olives.\n\n                                     BOBO\n                         Very good.\n\n               Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table \n               catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a \n               little louder.\n\n                                     SHEILA'S VOICE\n                         I'm trying to explain to you how I \n                         feel. Every time I try to explain \n                         how I feel, you explain how you feel. \n                         I don't think that's really much of \n                         a response.\n\n                                     UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE\n                         Well, its the only response I've \n                         got.\n\n               Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.\n\n                                     BOBO\n                         You wanna see a menu?\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Not yet. I'll wave.\n\n               Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at \n               the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the \n               man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument \n               goes on.\n\n                                     SHEILA'S VOICE\n                         I really do hate it though, when you \n                         take that tone with me. Like you're \n                         above it all and isn't it amusing.\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         But it is, isn't it?\n\n                                     SHEILA'S VOICE\n                         Not to me! This is my life, no matter \n                         how damned comical it may seem to \n                         you. I don't need some man standing \n                         above the struggle while I roll around \n                         in the mud!\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         I think you like the mud and I don't. \n                         That's fair, isn't it? If I don't \n                         care to...\n\n               Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the \n               man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and \n               stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.\n\n               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to \n               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his \n               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the \n               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with \n               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and \n               apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.\n\n                                     PERRY\n                         Sorry about that, folks. She's a \n                         very pretty mental patient.\n\n               The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.\n\n                                     PERRY\n                         Don't mind about me.

Sometimes I'm droning \n                         along and I look up, and there's \n                         this fresh young beautiful face, and \n                         it's all new to her and I'm this \n                         great guy who's just brilliant and \n                         thinks out loud.

It can \n                         go for a few weeks or a couple of \n                         precious months, but then she catches \n                         on that I'm just a burnt out old \n                         gasbag and that she's as fresh and \n                         bright and full of promise as \n                         moonlight in a martini. And at that \n                         moment, she stands up and throws a \n                         glass of water in my face, or some \n                         action to that effect.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         What you don't know about women is a \n                         lot.\n\n               INT.

It is a beautiful, poignant moment.\n\n               The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her \n               heartbreaking aria of farewell.

Otherwise, she is almost \n               succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices \n               Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards \n               it.\n\n               THE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL\n\n               She and Rudolph join hands.\n\n               RONNY AND LORETTA\n\n               grab each other's hand fiercely.\n\n               At last, they look at each other.

She was coughing her brains \n                         out. And still, she had to sing all \n                         the time...\n\n               Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before \n               her.\n\n               Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and \n               Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.\n\n               Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.\n\n               Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.\n\n               Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at \n               Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Pop?\n\n               Ronny looks at Loretta.

He glares at Ronny. He looks at \n               Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off. \n               Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.\n\n               COSMO AND MONA GOING OUT THE DOORS FROM LORETTA'S POV\n\n               LORETTA LOOKING AFTER THEM, STRICKEN\n\n               Ronny appears at her side, solicitous.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Let's get outta here.

A moment passes. Lights go on in \n               Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of \n               the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the \n               middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted \n               windows.\n\n               NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY\n\n               Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks \n               up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one \n               slender, slender thread.\n\n               MUSIC\n\n               It's \"MIMI'S ARIA\"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.\n\n               WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING\n\n               At the lighted window above. \"MIMI'S ARIA\" PLAYS. This tableau \n               reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in \n               the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long \n               moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy \n               shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She \n               hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks \n               away down the street.\n\n               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT\n\n               With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.\n\n               INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT\n\n               PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane.\n\n               Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. \n               Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to \n               the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action.\n\n               MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL\n\n               He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick \n               powerful jerk.\n\n               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT\n\n               Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes \n               to him.\n\n               INT. OF THE CAB\n\n               Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very \n               definite, determined way.\n\n                                     MR. JOHNNY\n                         19 Cranberry Street.\n\n               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\n               The cab rushes off into the night.\n\n               EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room \n               windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING \n               \"IT MUST BE HIM\". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his \n               luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.\n\n               The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.\n\n                                     MR. JOHNNY\n                         Hello.

She was as white as snow. \n                         And then she completely pulled back \n                         from death and stood up and put on \n                         her clothes and began to cook for \n                         everyone in the house. The mourners. \n                         And me. And herself!

Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the \n               entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five \n               Dogs.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Hello Pop.\n\n               The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and \n               then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.\n\n                                     MR.

Listen, \n                         Johnny, there's a question I want to \n                         ask you. And I want you to tell me \n                         the truth if you can. Why do men \n                         chase women?\n\n                                     MR. JOHNNY\n                         Well. There's the Bible story. God \n                         took a rib from Adam and made Eve. \n                         Maybe men chase women to get the rib \n                         back. When God took the rib, he left \n                         a hole there, place where there used \n                         to be something. and the women have \n                         that. Maybe a man isn't complete as \n                         a man without a woman.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         But why would a man need more than \n                         one woman?\n\n                                     MR. JOHNNY\n                         I don't know. Maybe because he fears \n                         death.\n\n               Rose leaps up, very excited.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         That's it!

And she's tormented by the \n               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks \n               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has \n               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is \n               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched \n               in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. \n               We follow her as she SINGS and walks.\n\n               WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW\n\n               She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. \n               She comes to it again. She kicks it again.\n\n               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and \n               enters the house.\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and \n               sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.\n\n               Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles \n               into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.\n\n               There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         What the hell happened to you?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Well.

He came right from the \n                         airport. He wanted to talk to you. \n                         You got a love bite on your neck. \n                         He's coming back this morning.\n\n               With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.\n\n               EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n               Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta \n               just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he \n               hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown \n               leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts \n               to SING \"O SOAVE FANCIULLA\". He SINGS it any old way, \n               occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just \n               muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he \n               remembers, which is a lot.\n\n               WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW\n\n               He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an \n               ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize \n               what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.\n\n               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a \n               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other \n               appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back \n               to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.\n\n               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and \n               then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him \n               in.\n\n               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN\n\n               Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the \n               kitchen. Rose calls out.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         It's not Johnny.\n\n               Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's \n               very surprised to see Ronny.\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         Ronny!\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Is Johnny here?\n\n                                     LORETTA\n                         He's coming.\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Good!

He regards the trio, \n               puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's \n                         brother.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         His brother.\n\n               Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of \n               him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he \n               puls down his spoon.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         You're Johnny's brother?\n\n                                     RONNY\n                         Yeah.\n\n               Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.\n\n               The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.\n\n               THE OLD MAN WALKS IN\n\n               He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.\n\n               He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his \n               hand opens in a gesture of supplication.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         I am old.

If she gets married, \n                         I'll pay for the whole thing.\n\n               The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at \n               the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.\n\n               He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.\n\n               The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts \n               down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking \n               to Cosmo.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Have I been a good wife?\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         I want you to stop seeing her.\n\n               Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old \n               clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists \n               to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. \n               Then slowly, he sits down.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         And go to confession.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                              (still not looking at \n                              her)\n                         A man... under stands one day... \n                         that his life is built on nothing. \n                         And that's a bad, crazy day.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Your life is not built on nothing. \n                         Ti amo.\n\n               She puts her hand across the table to him.\n\n                                     COSMO\n                         Ti amo.\n\n               He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts \n               his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been \n               able to hold her gaze in this whole story.
