The month is \n               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been \n               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica \n               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use.

ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL\n</b>\n               We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They \n               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall \n               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes \n               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is \n               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. \n               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, \n               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that \n               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a \n               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. \n               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something \n               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and\n\n<b>               INT.

It's the first \n               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of \n               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red \n               rose.

His wavy salt-and pepper hair is \n               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens \n               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a \n               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a \n               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is \n               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked \n               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and \n               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.\n\n               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who \n               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.\n\n               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she \n               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.\n\n               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their \n               order.\n\n<b>                                     BOBO\n</b>                         Are you ready?\n\n<b>                                     MR.

He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an \n               overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black \n               Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he \n               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and \n               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man \n               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.\n\n               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.\n\n               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and \n               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective \n               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the \n               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.\n\n               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears \n               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.\n\n<b>               INT.

A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around \n               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread \n               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.\n\n               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread.

She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives \n               a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.\n\n               Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips \n               it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy \n               goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray \n               where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process.

They are seated and people are looking at them.\n\n               Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, \n               something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing \n               good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes \n               her look like a big piece of hard candy.\n\n               Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row \n               of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.\n\n               They are holding their programs.

There's another table-for-two against the \n               wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, \n               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, \n               is having an argument with the man across from her.\n\n               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and \n               the argument is too low to be made out.

She tries to see past Sheila, to see the \n               man, but she can't without making too big a move.

This whole operation took about two seconds.\n\n               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to \n               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his \n               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the \n               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with \n               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and \n               apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.\n\n<b>                                     PERRY\n</b>                         Sorry about that, folks.

The spontaneity \n                         went out of it for me a long time \n                         ago.

Except \n                         sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning \n                         along and I look up, and there's \n                         this fresh young beautiful face, and \n                         it's all new to her and I'm this \n                         great guy who's just brilliant and \n                         thinks out loud.

It doesn't last. It can \n                         go for a few weeks or a couple of \n                         precious months, but then she catches \n                         on that I'm just a burnt out old \n                         gasbag and that she's as fresh and \n                         bright and full of promise as \n                         moonlight in a martini.

And she's tormented by the \n               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks \n               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has \n               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is \n               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched \n               in her hand, her program from La Boheme.

They start to SING along with him.\n\n               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a \n               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other \n               appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back \n               to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.\n\n<b>               EXT.
