It is a miracle that 22 million black people have\nnot risen up against their oppressors--in which they would\nhave been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the\ndemocratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of\nblack people has so fervently continued to believe in a\nturn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die\nphilosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people\nhave remained a peaceful people, while catching all the\ncenturies of hell that they have caught, here in white man's\nheaven!
