It is a miracle that 22 million black people have\nnot risen up against their oppressors--in which they would\nhave been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the\ndemocratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of\nblack people has so fervently continued to believe in a\nturn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die\nphilosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people\nhave remained a peaceful people, while catching all the\ncenturies of hell that they have caught, here in white man's\nheaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro\n'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with\ndegrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off\ntheir black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black\nmasses quiet until now.\"\n\n\t\t    --THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X\n\nTITLES--WHITE ON BLACK\n\n\t\t\t\t\t   PLACE\n\t\t\t\t Brooklyn, New York\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t   TIME\n\t\t\t\t\t  Present\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  WEATHER\n\t\t\t\t    Hot as shit!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY\n\nEXTREME CLOSE UP\n\nWE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISTER SE\u00d1OR LOVE DADDY\n\t\t  Waaaake up!\n\t\t  Wake up!
