He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought.\r\nHe starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small\r\nmicrophone.\r\n\r\n                    THEODORE\r\n          To my Chris, I have been thinking\r\n          about how I could possibly tell you\r\n          how much you mean to me. I remember\r\n          when I first started to fall in\r\n          love with you like it was last\r\n          night. Lying naked beside you in\r\n          that tiny apartment, it suddenly\r\n          hit me that I was part of this\r\n          whole larger thing, just like our\r\n          parents, and our parents' parents.\r\n          Before that I was just living my\r\n          life like I knew everything, and\r\n          suddenly this bright light hit me\r\n          and woke me up. That light was you.\r\n\r\nTheodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys\r\nwriting the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the\r\nmemories he's describing.\r\n\r\n                    THEODORE (CONT'D)\r\n          I can't believe it's already been\r\n          50 years since you married me. And\r\n          still to this day, every day, you\r\n          make me feel like the girl I was\r\n          when you first turned on the lights\r\n          and woke me up and we started this\r\n          adventure together. Happy\r\n          Anniversary, my love and my friend\r\n          til the end. Loretta. Print.\r\n\r\nCut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the\r\nscreen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed\r\ninto a handwritten letter on blue stationery.\r\n\r\nAs he says \"Loretta,\" we see \"Loretta\" being handwritten at\r\nthe bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on\r\nthe screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is\r\ntagged \"Chris\" and \"Me - Loretta.\" Underneath is a bullet\r\npoint email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband\r\nChris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after\r\ncollege, have had the greatest life together.\r\n\r\nTheodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful\r\nrobin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen\r\nhandwritten older-female cursive.

SUBWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n Theodore's on the subway. He's got his device in his breast\r\n pocket, with the lens facing out.\r\n\r\n A quiet, old sounding folk song starts. (I'm So Glad, by\r\n Entrance) He smiles, listening.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA\r\n            Do you like this song?\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            Mmm.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA\r\n            I heard it the other day and I\r\n            can't stop listening to it.\r\n\r\n The subway comes out of the tunnel and into the light. We are\r\n up in the hills looking out over the city as the morning\r\n light warms Theodore.\r\n\r\n\r\n INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY\r\n\r\n The music now picks up tempo as he steps off the train. They\r\n walk through the crowded subway station. As the song builds,\r\n Theodore starts picking up his pace. Eventually he's all out\r\n running, weaving through the people. Close on the lens of his\r\n device in his shirt pocket. Samantha is laughing wildly. He's\r\n smiling, happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                         pg. 47\r\n  CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n He runs through the tunnels and upstairs. They come out into\r\n sunlight and reveal that they are now at the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n They stand on a walkway above a beach, crowded with thousands\r\n of people. They look out at the ocean.

BEACH - DAY\r\n\r\n They walk through the sun-bathing crowd, looking for a place\r\n to sit. The camera studies all the people we pass. Many close\r\n up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the\r\n lens on Theodore's device, protruding from his pocket.\r\n They're photographed in a way that shows how strange the\r\n human body is.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Okay, so this might be a really\r\n               weird thought. What if you could\r\n               erase from your mind that you'd\r\n               ever seen a human body and then you\r\n               saw one. Imagine how strange it\r\n               would look. It would be this really\r\n               weird, gangly, awkward organism.\r\n               And you'd think: why are all these\r\n               parts where they are?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n                   (looking at the bodies)\r\n               Yeah, well there's probably some\r\n               Darwinian explanation for it all.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               I know, but don't be so boring.

Close on the lens on Theodore's\r\n device in his breast pocket. They watch the sun drop into the\r\n ocean. The music ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n They're on an elevated train, high above the city, looking\r\n out over the Los Angeles grid of sparkling lights. We come in\r\n mid-conversation.\r\n\r\n                     SAMANTHA\r\n           And what was it like being married?\r\n\r\n                     THEODORE\r\n           Well, it's hard for sure, but\r\n           there's something that feels so\r\n           good about sharing your life with\r\n           somebody.\r\n\r\n Cut to shots from Theodore's memory of Catherine doing a cute\r\n little dance for him as he's working at home.

I used\r\n           to read all of her writing - all\r\n           through her masters and Ph.D. And\r\n           she read every word I ever wrote.\r\n           We were a big influence on each\r\n           other.\r\n\r\n                     SAMANTHA\r\n           In what way did you influence her?\r\n\r\n                     THEODORE\r\n           She came from a background where\r\n           nothing was ever good enough. And\r\n           that was something that weighed\r\n           heavy on her, but in our house\r\n           together, there was a sense of just\r\n           trying stuff and allowing each\r\n           other to fail and to be excited\r\n           about things.

But then, that's the hard\r\n               part - growing without growing\r\n               apart, or changing without it\r\n               scaring the other person.\r\n                   (beat)\r\n               I still find myself having\r\n               conversations with her in my mind,\r\n               rehashing old arguments or\r\n               defending myself against something\r\n               she said about me.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Yeah, I know what you mean.

I just caught\r\n               myself thinking about it over and\r\n               over and then I realized that I was\r\n               simply remembering it as something\r\n               that was wrong with me. That was\r\n               the story I was telling myself,\r\n               that I was somehow inferior.

AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK\r\n\r\n Amy and Theodore sit, talking somberly.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n               I cannot believe after eight years\r\n               how petty the argument was that\r\n               actually ended it. We came home and\r\n               he asked me if I'd put my shoes\r\n               next to the door where he likes to\r\n               put the shoes. I don't want to be\r\n               told where to put my shoes. I want\r\n               to just sit on the sofa for a\r\n               minute and relax. And so we argued\r\n               for ten minutes about that and\r\n               about how he's just trying to make\r\n               our house a home. I say he's\r\n               overwhelming, he says I'm not\r\n               trying hard enough. I say that's\r\n               all I'm doing is trying, but I'm\r\n               just not trying the way he wants me\r\n               to. He's trying to control the way\r\n               I'm trying. And I think we must\r\n               have had this argument hundreds of\r\n               times before and I finally had to\r\n               stop because I couldn't be in that\r\n               situation anymore where we were\r\n               making each other feel bad about\r\n               ourselves.

We can get it\r\n               out of the way.\r\n\r\n She opens the documents, pulls out a pen and starts to read.\r\n She's about to start signing, but then stops. We can see her\r\n filling with emotion, but not wanting to show Theodore. She\r\n swallows and recovers. She looks up at Theodore, giving him\r\n an \"everything's fine\" smile, but it's not.\r\n\r\n\r\n EXT.

So I'm happy with that.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               You're your own worst critic, I'm\r\n               sure it's amazing. Even that paper\r\n               you wrote on synaptic behavioral\r\n               routines made me cry.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               Yeah, but everything makes you cry.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Everything you make makes me cry.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               So are you seeing anybody?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Yeah, I am, for the last few\r\n               months. That's the longest I've\r\n               wanted to be with anybody since we\r\n               split up.\r\n\r\n She smiles, conflicted, but warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                         pg. 65\r\n  CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               Well, you seem good.\r\n\r\n                          THEODORE\r\n               Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing\r\n               better. She's been really good for\r\n               me. I guess it's just been nice to\r\n               be with someone who's excited about\r\n               the world.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n                   (with a sliver of hurt)\r\n               Oh good, excited's great.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               No, I mean - I wasn't in such a\r\n               good place myself and in that way\r\n               it's been nice.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               I always felt like you wished I\r\n               could just be a happy, light,\r\n               everything's great, bouncy L.A.\r\n               wife. But that's not me.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               No. I didn't want that.\r\n\r\n Beat.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               So what's she like?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Well, her name's Samantha, and\r\n               she's an operating system, and\r\n               she's really complex and\r\n               interesting. I mean it's only been\r\n               a few months, but--\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n               Wait. You're dating your computer?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n                   (defensive)\r\n               She's not just a computer. She's\r\n               her own person. She doesn't just do\r\n               whatever I want.\r\n\r\n                          CATHERINE\r\n               I didn't say that.\r\n                   (beat)\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                       pg. 66\r\n  CONTINUED: (2)\r\n                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)\r\n            But it does make me sad that you\r\n            can't handle real emotions,\r\n            Theodore.\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            They are real emotions. How do you\r\n            know--\r\n\r\n Theodore stops himself.\r\n\r\n                      CATHERINE\r\n            What? Say it. Am I really that\r\n            scary? Say it. How do I know what?!\r\n\r\n Theodore doesn't say anything. The WAITRESS walks up.\r\n\r\n                      WAITRESS\r\n            How are you guys doing?\r\n\r\n                      CATHERINE\r\n            Fine. We used to be married. He\r\n            couldn't handle me so he wanted to\r\n            put me on Prozac. Now he's madly in\r\n            love with his laptop.\r\n\r\n The waitress doesn't know what to say.\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            Well, if you heard the conversation\r\n            in context. What I was trying to\r\n            say--\r\n\r\n                      CATHERINE\r\n            You wanted to have a wife without\r\n            the challenges of actually dealing\r\n            with anything real. I'm glad you\r\n            found someone. It's perfect.\r\n\r\n                      WAITRESS\r\n                (awkwardly)\r\n            Let me know if you guys need\r\n            anything.\r\n\r\n                         CATHERINE\r\n            Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n Theodore is sitting at his desk, not working. He sees\r\n Samantha calling him, takes a moment, then answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                         pg. 67\r\n  CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                            THEODORE\r\n                      (quick)\r\n               Hey.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n                   (warm)\r\n               Hi there. Are you busy?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Just working, what's going on?\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               I had all the papers sent to your\r\n               attorney's office, who by the way,\r\n               is a dick. He was very relieved to\r\n               get them. I think we saved him from\r\n               a massive heart attack, so we can\r\n               feel good about that.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Great, thanks.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Hey, are you okay?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n                   (still distant)\r\n               Yeah, I am.

THEODORE'S OFFICE - EVENING\r\n\r\n Everyone has gone. Theodore walks through the empty office\r\n into the reception area. He scans and drops his letters into\r\n the outgoing mailbox.

When\r\n               you   first start going out it's like\r\n               the   honeymoon phase and you have\r\n               sex   all the time. It's normal.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n                   (still insecure, not\r\n                    convinced)\r\n               Oh, okay.\r\n                   (beat)\r\n               Well, I found something that I\r\n               thought could be fun. It's a\r\n               service that provides a surrogate\r\n               sexual partner for an OS/Human\r\n               relationship.\r\n\r\n                           THEODORE\r\n               What?\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Here, look.\r\n\r\n Theodore looks at his device. It shows a website for a\r\n service called \"Complete Touch\" with profiles of different\r\n women. He flips through the women.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n               I found a girl that I really like\r\n               that I've been emailing with. Her\r\n               name is Isabella, and I think you\r\n               would like her, too.\r\n\r\n Samantha shows images of Isabella on the screen. She's a\r\n stunning, elegant, sophisticated beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                        pg. 72\r\n  CONTINUED: (2)\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n                (uncomfortable)\r\n            So she's like a prostitute?\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA\r\n            No, not at all. There's no money\r\n            involved. She's doing it because\r\n            she wants to be part of our\r\n            relationship.\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            Why?

That doesn't\r\n            sound like a good idea. Someone's\r\n            feelings are bound to get hurt.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA\r\n            It'll be fun.

This is important to me.\r\n\r\n Theodore looks at a photo of Isabella who looks gorgeous and\r\n in control, without an ounce of self-doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n Theodore sits on the sofa alone, waiting. Dressed up, hair\r\n brushed, his device in his shirt pocket with lens facing out.\r\n There's a knock at the door. He answers it. ISABELLA stands\r\n there with a demure smile, wearing a tasteful, sexy dress.\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            Hi, welcome. I'm Theodore.\r\n\r\n She doesn't say anything. Theodore stands awkwardly, reaches\r\n into his pocket for a tiny earpiece and a little black dot.\r\n We see close on his hand the black dot has a camera lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                         pg. 73\r\n  CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE (CONT'D)\r\n               Samantha told me to give you these.\r\n               It's a camera and an earpiece.\r\n\r\n She puts the earpiece in her ear and the little black dot on\r\n her cheek like a mole. She turns and leaves the apartment,\r\n closes the door, then immediately opens the door and comes\r\n back in. Theodore hears Samantha's voice in his earpiece.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Honey, I'm home.\r\n\r\n Isabella smiles not speaking but acting along to Samantha's\r\n words. Isabella gives him a big hug, holds his head close and\r\n strokes his hair.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n               How was your day?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n                   (awkwardly hugs Isabella)\r\n               Good.

Just uh, went to work.\r\n               Um... I wrote a letter for the\r\n               Wilsons in Rhode Island. Their son\r\n               graduated magna cum laude from\r\n               Brown. That made me happy.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Great! You've written letters to\r\n               him from his parents for a long\r\n               time, right?\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               Yeah, that's right, since he was\r\n               twelve.\r\n\r\n He feels her breath on his neck. Theodore is split between\r\n being uncomfortable and cautiously touching Isabella's back,\r\n exploring slightly. She pushes herself into him.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               You look tired, sweetheart. Come\r\n               with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                           pg. 74\r\n  CONTINUED: (2)\r\n\r\n Isabella leans back and looks at Theodore with a seductive\r\n smile. He tries to smile back. She leads him to the couch.\r\n\r\n He sits. She stands above him.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n            I could do a little dance for you.\r\n\r\n She does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n                (sympathetic to him being\r\n                 a worrier)\r\n            Come on Theodore, just play with\r\n            me. Don't be such a worrier! Come\r\n            on.\r\n\r\n He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap,\r\n straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his\r\n eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her\r\n back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and Samantha are\r\n both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him,\r\n grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. Theodore gasps.\r\n\r\n                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n                (whispering)\r\n            Does my body feel nice?\r\n\r\n Close on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He\r\n moans.\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n                (with his eyes closed)\r\n            Yes, it does.\r\n\r\n                       SAMANTHA\r\n                (whispering)\r\n            Come on, get out of your head and\r\n            kiss me.\r\n                (beat)\r\n            Now take me in the bedroom. I can't\r\n            wait anymore.\r\n\r\n Isabella stands. Her chin is down and her hair is in her\r\n face. She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He\r\n watches her from behind, still nervous, but excited.\r\n\r\n\r\n INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\r\n\r\n Theodore stands behind Isabella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                          pg. 75\r\n  CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               Undo my dress.\r\n\r\n Theodore starts taking her dress off, touching her. Samantha\r\n moans. Isabella turns, in her bra and underwear. She\r\n unbuttons his shirt, kisses his chest.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n               That feels nice. Oh, that feels\r\n               good. That feels so good.\r\n\r\n She is now kissing his neck again, pushed up against him.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n               Do you love me?\r\n\r\n                            THEODORE\r\n                      (eyes closed, in ecstasy)\r\n               Yes.\r\n\r\n Isabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n                   (breathing hard)\r\n               Tell me you love me.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n               I love you.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n               Oh god.

Tell me.\r\n\r\n He opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant\r\n face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees\r\n Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an\r\n awkward, seductive smile.\r\n\r\n                         THEODORE\r\n                   (apologetic, breaking the\r\n                    moment)\r\n               Samantha, I do love you, but - it's\r\n               just - this feels strange.\r\n\r\n                         SAMANTHA\r\n               What's wrong, sweetheart?\r\n\r\n Isabella is looking nervous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\nHer                                                          pg. 76\r\n  CONTINUED: (2)\r\n\r\n                      THEODORE\r\n            It just feels strange.

APARTMENT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n  Close on Theodore and what he sees and feels. His hand on the\r\n  cold metal hand rail. His bare feet and the sound they make\r\n  on the unfinished cement. Amy's hair as she's hit with wind\r\n  when she opens the door to the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXT. APARTMENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n  Theodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely\r\n  quiet. The sun isn't up yet. The city is just beginning to be\r\n  lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue.\r\n\r\n  They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought,\r\n  taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He\r\n  stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a\r\n  water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a\r\n  boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock.\r\n\r\n  Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on\r\n  his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks\r\n  at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He\r\n  looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting\r\n  to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as\r\n  hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse\r\n  off into the city.\r\n\r\n                                                  FADE OUT.\r\n\n\n\n\nHer\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Spike Jonze\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:54.168800"}
