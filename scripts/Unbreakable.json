The boy\nwears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized\nstuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF\nVOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful\nrides in the parking lot.\n\nThe door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.\n\nElijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic\nbathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t MOTHER\n</b>\t\tWe'll play the water pistol\n\t\tgame next.\n\nElijah nods, \"Yes\" happily.\n\nThe mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of\nwomen. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah\ndoesn't like it. He moves away from the line.\n\nA CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows\nthe voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.\nCLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.\n\nFor a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.\n\nHe emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.\n\nA man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.\n\nElijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... \"The Hurricane.\"\n\nHe watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull\nthe metal bars down in front of them.\n\nThe man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.\n\nElijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under\nthe turnstile and climbs onto the platform.\n\nElijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment\nand sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.\n\nHe looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.\n\nHis small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His\nexpression changes.\n\nElijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their\nsoftness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's\nwedged in between them. Feels good.\n\nHe reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah\nlooks a little anxious. Beat.\n\nHe pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before\nhe ties the arms together. He checks its softness.\n\nElijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an\neight year old smile of pride.\n\n<b>AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.\n</b>\nHe searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her\ncalling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t MOTHER\n</b>\t\tElijah...\n\nShe moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The\nHurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes\nimmediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.\n\nHer eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.\n\nA HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.\n\nElijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t ELIJAH\n</b>\t\tI won't get hurt momma! I'm\n\t\tsafe!\n\n<b>HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.\n</b>\nThe platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped\nman. She's pointing at Elijah.\n\nThe platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's\nangered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.\n\nAnd then the ride speeds up.\n\nThe gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.\n\nElijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.\n\nSuddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone\ngrabs the metal bars to hold on.\n\nElijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him\nand then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed\nanimal.\n\nElijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over\nthe rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.\n\nElijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.\n\n<b>THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.\n</b>\nTHE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions\nsuddenly.\n\nElijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the\ncompartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR\n<b>SOMETHING CRACK.\n</b>\n<b>TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.\n</b>\nThe ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling\nclouds in a mixture of agony and terror.\n\nThe ride changes directions.\n\nElijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.\n<b>WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.\n</b>\nThe world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the\nfloor of the compartment.\n\nAnd then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual\nstop.\n\n<b>THE TEENAGERS MOAN.\n</b>\nElijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.\n\n<b>WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.\n</b>\n\t\t\t\t MOTHER(o.s.)\n\t\tHis bones... He's not\n\t\twell...\n\n<b>HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.\n</b>\n\t\t\t\t MOTHER(o.s.)\n\t\tElijah baby...\n\nThen her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to\nscream.\n\nElijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The\nother is curved horrifically like an \"s\". His mouth is open. His eyes are\nbulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year\nold child about to black out from the pain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE TO BLACK:\n</b>\n<b>PRESENT: EXT.

Right behind him.\n\nThe man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching\nover him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.\n\nDavid Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp\ntogether like and iron vise. He squeezes.\n\nThe man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.\n\nDavid yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back\nviolently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard\nstop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.\n\nThe huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.\nDavid's arm remains locked around his throat.\n\nThe man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.\nHe spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The\nroom shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.\n\nAnd then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in\nDavid's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate\nblows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.\n\nThe elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.\n\nDavid pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his\ntremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE\nAPPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.\n\nDavid keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just\ndragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the\ncarpet now.\n\nDavid slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the\nman's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.\n\nDavid's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.\nThe man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE\nROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.\n\nHe moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone\ncords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.\n\n\t\t\t\t DAVID(soft)\n\t\tIt's over now.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYour children are fine.\n\t\tThey're getting help.\n\nHe unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.\n\n\t\t\t\t DAVID(soft)\n\t\tI'm going to go now.\n\nHe stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally\nstill against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run\ndown her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.\n\nDavid moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath\nagainst his hand. Beat.\n\nHe rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom\nof someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position\nagainst her bathroom door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nDavid enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares\ndown at the shadowy figure of his son.\n\nHe pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nDavid sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.\n\nHe doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch.

She shifts her head on the pillow.\n\nThen her body RISES INTO THE AIR.\n\nShe starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees\nDavid close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.\nNo words are spoken.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nThey enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.\n\nShe watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.\n\nHe covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.\n\n\t\t\t\t DAVID(soft)\n\t\tI had a bad dream.\n\nDavid tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.\n\nMegan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.\n\n\t\t\t\t MEGAN(soft)\n\t\tIt's over now.\n\nShe closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. STREET - DAY\n</b>\nDowntown Philadelphia.\n\nPeople move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is\namong them.\n\nHe crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the\nstore are open.\n\nA banner over the door reads, \"Annual Sale.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

He turns and looks at\na framed sketch.\n\nBeat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t WOMAN\n</b>\t\t...See the villain's eyes.\n\t\tThey're larger than the\n\t\tother characters'. They\n\t\tinsinuate a slightly skewed\n\t\tperspective of how they see\n\t\tthe world. Just off normal.\n\nDavid stares at the drawing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t DAVID\n</b>\t\tHe doesn't look very\n\t\tthreatening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t WOMAN\n</b>\t\tThat's what I said to my\n\t\tson. He said, there's always\n\t\ttwo kinds. The soldier\n\t\tvillain who fights the hero\n\t\twith his hands, and then\n\t\tthere's the real threat. The\n\t\tbrilliant and evil arch\n\t\tenemy who fights the hero\n\t\twith his mind.\n\nDavid turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her\nsixties who stands next to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t DAVID\n</b>\t\tAre you Elijah's mother?\n\nThe woman turns and looks at David for the first time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t ELIJAH'S MOTHER\n</b>\t\tI am. I'm helping him with\n\t\tthe sale.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t DAVID\n</b>\t\tIt's a pleasure to meet you.\n\t\tI'm David Dunne.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t ELIJAH'S MOTHER\n</b>\t\tHe's spoken of you.

He looks at it with his hands in his\npockets. Beat.\n\nDavid's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.\n\nTHE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.\nHe's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the\nmachine. The machine has wheels.\n\nDavid turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his\nwheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes\nnegotiating.\n\nDavid turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more\nyou look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a\nwheelchair.\n\nDavid looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has\nspotted David.\n\nBeat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t ELIJAH\n</b>\t\tDid you see this?\n\nElijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.\n\nThere's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled\nchildren behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\t ELIJAH(soft)\n\t\tIt has begun.\n\nDavid stares quietly at the sketch of himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t ELIJAH\n</b>\t\tWhen I saw it this morning.\n\t\tI felt a part of the world\n\t\tagain.\n\nElijah looks down at the newspaper.\n\nDavid hesitates and then reaches forward.\n\nHe reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.\n\n<b>FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE\n</b><b>AIRFIELD.
