Doesn't notice\n    through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.\n\n    He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his\n    mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO\n    ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)\n    at a costume party.\n\n    He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold\n    compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The\n    tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he\n    sees the bulldozers.\n\n    The tea cup shatters on the floor.\n                                                     CUT TO:\n5   EXT.

He yells into his mobile phone.\n\n                       ARTHUR\n                  (into phone)\n              What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?\n              You just said he was still at breakfast!\n\n    MR.

This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.\n    As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down\n    towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.\n    He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.\n\n                         ARTHUR\n                 Ford?\n\n    He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.\n\n                         FORD\n                 Arthur!
