I can leave her with\n         you for a little while?\n<b>                        JACK\n</b>         Of course. Leave her with us.\n         Come back whenever you want.\n         Get some rest.\nSylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her\non the doorstep.\n<b>                       SYLVIA\n</b>         I brought a couple of things\n         for her, just for a few days...\nMichael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed by\na second, and then a third.\n<b>                          PETER\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           139.\n</b>\n                (taking Mary\n                 in his arms)\n         Is she hungry?\n<b>                       SYLVIA\n</b>         Yeah, it's time for her bottle\n         -- it's all ready in the bag...\n<b>                       JACK\n</b>         I'll go heat up some water right\n         away. Would you like a cup of\n         coffee?\n<b>                       SYLVIA\n</b>         Oh, okay, thanks...\n\nPeter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by\nJack and Michael with the bags.\nSylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the\nhall.\nIn the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags,\nthe bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their\npride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her\nhands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael\ntakes some sheets out of the bag.\n<b>                       MICHAEL\n</b>         I'll go make up her bed!\nHe exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around,\nleaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and\ngoes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes,\na fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and\nraces back to the kitchen.\n<b>                       MICHAEL\n</b>                (floored)\n         Hey, you guys -- come and see,\n         come and see!\n<b>                        PETER\n</b>         What?\n<b>                       MICHAEL\n</b>         Come see, I said.\nJack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living\nroom. They stop short in front of the crib: There is\nSylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb\nand sleeping like an angel.\n<b>                       MICHAEL\n</b>         The poor thing, she's really\n         wiped out.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                               140.\n</b>\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>            She'll need two or three months\n            to recover, at least... Maybe\n            more!\n<b>                          PETER\n</b>            We could set up a room for her\n            here...\n<b>                          MICHAEL\n</b>            A room for her and a room for\n            Mary...\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>            Then we could have four shifts\n            instead of three!\n\n<b>                          PETER\n</b>            Yeah, but I don't think she'll\n            agree. She's got her own life\n            to live.\n<b>                          MICHAEL\n</b>            Yeah, she probably wouldn't want\n            to move here. She'd think we'd\n            jump on her any chance we could...\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>            But we'd make a rule, she'd just\n            be 'one of the guys!'\n<b>                          MICHAEL\n</b>            She'll never want to...\n<b>                          SYLVIA\n</b>                   (very awake)\n            So, I'll take the ten A.M. to three\n            P.M. shift... And I'll take every\n            other night... plus the walk in\n            the park in the afternoon before I\n            go to work... and we split the\n            rent equally... and I'll just be\n            'one of the guys'... deal?\n<b>                           PETER, MICHAEL, AND JACK\n</b>                    (smiling broadly)\n            Deal.\nMary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead-\nily    but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by\nits    ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her\nhead    off.\n<b>FREEZE FRAME.\n</b>\n<b>                              END!\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Three Men and a Baby</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Jim Cruickshank\" title=\"Scripts by Jim Cruickshank\">Jim Cruickshank</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Orr\" title=\"Scripts by James Orr\">James Orr</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Colline Serreau\" title=\"Scripts by Colline Serreau\">Colline Serreau</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Family\" title=\"Family Scripts\">Family</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Three Men and a Baby Script.html#comments\" title=\"Three Men and a Baby comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:18:15.577894"}
