In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is\n    celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami\n    team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and\n    drinking champagne.\n\n    In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass-\n    engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to\n    be a BUSINESSMAN.\n    The plane is flying over the coastline.\n    The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin\n    is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning\n    around to look at the passengers.\n                             JACK\n                      (to Paul)\n               Oh my God!

Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and\nintensely, to her.\n                         JACK\n          Hello.   I'm the captain of this\n          plane.

Out of all these beautiful\n          women I noticed only you, and...\nThe Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi-\nnessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has\ngotten up and walked over to Jack.\n                          BUSINESSMAN\n          Are you Paul?\n                        JACK\n          No, I'm not.\n                 (to Jane)\n\n                                                     4.\n\n          My name's Jack and I live in a\n          fabulous apartment in Manhattan\n          overlooking the park and...\n                        BUSINESSMAN\n          But you're the pilot, aren't you?\n\n                        JACK\n          Yes, I'm the pilot...\n                 (to Jane)\n          ...

It is a beautiful, impressive\n    stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the\n    passengers.\n\n\n2   INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY              2\n    Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves\n    with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but\n    Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go.\n    Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.\n\n                            JACK\n              God, what a woman!\n    Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.\n                            JACK\n              Wanna share a cab?\n                               Paul\n              Yeah, sure!\n    A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver\n    looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.\n                            JACK\n              She's so beautiful! I've never\n              been so in love before. Can you\n              believe she gave me her phone\n              number... Oh, Christ -- where is\n              it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I\n              lost it... It's a matter of life\n              and death... Oh here it is --\n              thank God!\n    All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car\n    on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul\n    notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON,\n    is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting\n    beside him.\n                            GRATON\n              They're slowing down.    Take a\n              picture.\n    The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to\n    be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul.\n    The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it.\n    Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.\n                            PAUL\n              Listen, I need a favor, I got\n\n                                                         7.\n\n          a little problem.\n                        JACK\n          Yeah, sure...

I gotta\n          give her a hand. Look at the\n          colors in her hair! Christ, I've\n          never seen a woman like her\n          before...\nHe's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.\n                        PAUL\n          Jack, listen, can I...\n                        JACK\n          Sure you can, no problem...\n          Listen, I gotta go now, I'm\n          gonna see if she'll share a cab\n          with me.

Come\n          around 9, okay? See ya later.\n\nJack races toward the woman and begins to help her\nwith the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her\nand we can hear a little of what he's saying.\n                        JACK\n          As exquisite as you are...\n          I think I'm gonna faint.\nHe kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.\nThe young woman is flabbergasted.\nA lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.\n\n                                                                  8.\n\n3   INT.

The lights are dim. There are\n    about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet\n    buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others\n    are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner,\n    Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.\n    She is laughing as she listens to him.\n                             JACK\n                     (whispering\n                      passionately)\n              This is no line and I'm not\n              trying to get you into bed.

I'll\n              be right back.\n    Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as\n    he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running\n    toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he\n    passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement\n    conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA.\n    They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy-\n    ing it.\n                            SOPHIA\n              Are you saying that's art, are\n              you really saying that's art?\n              Well then you explain why.\n                            MICHAEL\n              It goes back to prehistoric man.\n              They had comic strips on their\n              walls, for God's sake.\n                            JACK\n                     (whispering\n                      in Michael's\n                      ear)\n              I'm having a hard time.

Paul sees Jack and begins to\n    gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise\n    of the ENGINES.\n    Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his\n    package.\n                            JACK\n              Damn! I forgot to tell them about\n              the package!\n                     (to Ron)\n              I gotta make a quick phone call.\n              I'll be right back.\n                            RON\n                     (knowingly)\n              Jack, there'll be plenty of girls\n              where we're going.\n                            JACK\n              Oh, c'mon, I've really got to\n              make a phone call!

As he walks we see\n    that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.\n\n9   INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY                            9\n    In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three\n    partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is\n    gathered around a large model, the project for a big\n    amusement park. They all seem worried about something.\n    JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry.\n                            JERRY\n              The model's not finished, the\n              blueprints are a mess and you may\n              as well forget the specs, they're\n              a disaster!

Why break with\n         tradition?\n                       JERRY\n         Because this is the chance of a\n         lifetime for our company, and\n         there happens to be a deadline.\n         There are millions of dollars\n         at stake here.

In the\n     basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently\n     resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object\n     in amazement. There is an envelope pinned to the basket\n     with the words, \"FOR JACK\" written on it.

He realizes she's soaked.\n     This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she\n     squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom,\n     spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the\n     baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers\n     Michael's arms to the couch.

A stormy argument\n     is going on.\n                             MICHAEL\n               Oh no you're not, you're not gonna\n               leave me alone with her.\n                             PETER\n               I told you -- I have a date.\n                             MICHAEL\n               You rotten bastard -- do you see\n               me going out on any dates?\n                             PETER\n               Look, it's with Natalie -- I've\n               been after her for months already.\n                             MICHAEL\n               So what! If you leave me alone\n               with this kid, I swear I'll pack\n               up and be outta here by morning.\n                             PETER\n               You're a real drag, y'know?\n               Tonight was gonna be my big night!\n               Now I bet it's gonna be Carl's big\n               night.\n\n                                                                      42.\n\n\n     He exits, violently slamming the door behind him.\n     Michael sits back down, grumbling.\n\n44   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DUSK                                    44\n\n     Peter is making a phone call.   He has Mary in his arms.\n     He's in a foul mood.\n                             PETER\n               Hello, Natalie? It's Peter.\n               Listen, I'm really screwed. Jerry\n               just called and we've run into a\n               snag with the blueprints for the\n               competition, it's an emergency.\n               I've gotta go over to the office\n               right away, I think it's gonna be\n               an all-nighter... Of course I\n               didn't know about this yesterday --\n               he just called me.\n     Mary reaches out and begins to jab the buttons on the\n     phone. Peter pulls her back.\n                             PETER\n               Hello? Hello?... No, I'm not\n               trying to hang up on you. We're\n               having some problems with the\n               phone, that's all... No, Natalie,\n               there's no one else here! You're\n               the only woman I... I swear I'm\n               not lying to you... What? You're\n               going to call Carl?\n                      (furious)\n               Okay, go ahead, call him if you\n               want. I don't give a shit... Of\n               course I'm not jealous. What\n               makes you think I'm jealous?\n\n45   INT. KITCHEN - EVENING                                      45\n     Peter and Michael are silently eating sandwiches at a\n     corner of the kitchen table. Peter is fuming. Michael\n     glances at him out of the corner of his eye.\n\n46   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    46\n     Michael, completely zonked, is changing Mary as best he\n     can. Peter sits, waiting, on the couch.\n\n47   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    47\n     Peter is rocking the basket, as if in a trance.   Michael\n\n                                                                      43.\n\n     goes back to sleep on the couch.\n\n48   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                                     48\n     Peter is talking on the phone.   He has Mary in his arms.\n\n                              PETER\n                       (on the phone)\n               Jerry, hi, it's Peter.

Hey, take it easy, will you...\n               I'm sick. Seriously ill. I'm\n               burning up... The doctor had to\n               come, I've gotta stay in bed till\n               Friday.\n                       (shouting to drown\n                        out Jerry shouting)\n               Hey, hey, hey, I'll work round the\n               clock all weekend long...

APARTMENT - DAY                                        49\n     Peter, wearing a coat, enters carrying packages that he\n     puts down in the living room, now transformed into a\n     nursery. A makeshift changing table, rubber wash basin,\n     baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby\n     shampoo, etc. are all over the place. He drops all his\n     purchases on the floor, sits down on the couch and picks\n     up a book, in which he's instantly absorbed: we see from\n     the cover that it's a book on children.\n\n50   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                                     50\n     Peter is lying on his bed now surrounded by dozens of\n     baby-care books. Many of which are open. He's reading\n     them with great passion, and making notes.\n\n51   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY                                   51\n     Michael is sitting on the floor surrounded by his\n     drawings. Mary is lying next to him.\n                             MICHAEL\n                      (on the phone)\n               I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Oxman,\n               but I've run into a few problems,\n               I won't be able to bring you the\n               drawings tomorrow morning as I\n\n                                                                    44.\n\n               promised. In fact, it won't be\n               until the day after tomorrow at\n               the soonest.\n     Michael sees Mary kick over a bottle of india ink over\n     his drawings. He winces.\n\n                              MICHAEL\n                      (into phone)\n               On second thought, Mr. Oxman...\n               uh, better make that the end of\n               next week.\n                      (shouting on the\n                       other end)\n               Please don't get upset, Mr. Oxman.\n               I'll do everything possible to\n               get them to you sooner... You have\n               my word... I apologize again,\n               Mr. Oxman... Thank you again,\n               Mr. Oxman. Goodb...\n                      (an audible\n                       click)\n               ... Mr. Oxman? Hello, Mr. Oxman?\n\n52   INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK                                   52\n     The living room is a total mess. A harrassed Peter,\n     lying on the floor, dreamily watches Mary who is lying\n     on her tummy in a sheet, playing with a SQUEAKY RUBBER\n     GIRAFFE. They look at each other, as sober as judges.\n\n53   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  53\n     Peter and Michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the\n     living room couches.\n     Peter has a child care book over his face. MARY, in her\n     basket, wakes up and utters a FEW LITTLE NOISES. The\n     two men jump up and go over to her basket like robots.\n     Mary looks at them and smiles.\n\n54   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      54\n     Michael is giving her night feeding. Mary is falling\n     asleep in his arms; the nipple falls out of her mouth,\n     which goes on sucking anyway. Michael is falling asleep,\n     too, his head lolling over to one side.\n\n55   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                    55\n     The living room is back to normal, spic 'n' span.\n     They've gotten rid of all the baby paraphernalia.   The\n\n                                                                 45.\n\n     basket is on one of the couches.     Mary is asleep.\n     On the basket are warm clothes for outdoors, a bonnet and\n     a coat, a full bottle, cans of formula, toilet articles,\n     and a pile of diapers.\n\n     Seated on the couches facing each other, Peter and\n     Michael are waiting for something.\n                             MICHAEL\n               He didn't say what time?\n                             PETER\n               All he said was Thursday.\n                             MICHAEL\n               Terrific! -- We could rot here\n               till eight o'clock tonight.\n                             PETER\n               Well, I'm prepared to rot here\n               till midnight if I have to, as\n               long as we get rid of her.\n                             MICHAEL\n               Jack really could have called. He\n               has to have gotten our message by\n               now.\n                             PETER\n               Well, when he does call, I'm gonna\n               let him have it! That sonofabitch\n               is on the beaches of Brazil\n               proposing to the whole goddamn\n               world. And we're here living in\n               hell! He's gonna get his ass on\n               the next plane back here.\n               Vacation's over, Jack-baby, you\n               better believe it.\n                             MICHAEL\n                      (angrily)\n               Damn right!\n                      (beat softer)\n               It's almost time for her bottle,\n               you know.\n                             PETER\n               Oh hell!\n\n56   EXT. STREET - DAY                                      56\n     On the street two men drive by on a motorcycle looking at\n     the numbers on the apartment buildings. They stop a few\n     yards from the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's\n     building.\n\n                                                                       46.\n\n\n     They are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls\n     ahead of them and parks just beyond them. In this car\n     we recognize Graton sitting with a partner.\n     The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get\n     off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the\n     building.\n     Graton gets out of his car    and heads for the building.\n     He glances into the lobby,    then goes in. He watches the\n     elevator floor indicator,    notes the floor it stops on,\n     then calmly returns to his    car.\n\n57   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       57\n\n     Peter and Michael are still sitting on the living room\n     couches. The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael springs up and\n     runs to open the door. Peter follows him.\n     On the    doorstep stand the TWO PUNKS. One of them is\n     short    and speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent. The\n     other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his\n     buddy    and doesn't speak.\n                               PUNK #1\n                 Jack Collins live here?\n                                 MICHAEL\n                 Yes, he does.\n                               PUNK #1\n                 We came for the package.\n                               PETER\n                 Package? Oh that's cute,\n                 referring to her as a package!\n                 Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's\n                 a lousy stinking bitch.\n                                 PUNK #1\n                 Sylvia?\n                               PETER\n                 Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her\n                 she's got a hell of a nerve\n                 dumping her problems into our\n                 laps!\n                               PUNK #1\n                        (nervously)\n                 Problems?

Didn't they tell\n          you we were gonna be here today?\n\n                        MICHAEL\n          Sure they told us! So what?\n          That doesn't make the last four\n          days any less hellish than they\n          were!\n                        PETER\n          Well, anyway, they're here now,\n          that's all that matters!\nPeter turns and walks toward the basket.\n                        PETER\n          The next bottle's in 45 minutes.\n          I made it already. It's in the\n          basket.\n                         PUNK #1\n          Bottle?   Whadda ya mean, bottle?\n                        MICHAEL\n          About an hour after her bottle,\n          she starts yawning. Put her to\n          bed right away or it's pure hell\n          for the next three hours, at least\n          that's what we've noticed.\nPeter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at\nthe baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.\n                        PUNK #1\n          What the hell is that?   A baby?\n                        PETER\n                 (sarcastic)\n          No, it's a very short teenager.\n          Of course it's a baby! Now listen\n          carefully: I'm giving you a can\n          of the milk she's been getting.\n          She loves it, and more importantly,\n\n                                                          48.\n\n          she's not allergic to it. I even\n          put a can of the same brand in\n          here for you, but in powdered form,\n          understand?\nPunk #1 hears \"powder\" and catches on.\n\n                           PUNK #1\n          Oh! I get it!      Powdered milk!\n          Very clever!\n                        PETER\n          Yeah, right... real clever...\n          Okay, here.

You can take her\n          out now.\n                           PETER\n          Take what out?

He flies, overwhelmed\n     by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and\n     makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a\n     bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder\n     spill out of it.

Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal-\nlet and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he\ndiscovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is\nwhispering something. Peter holds his license out  for\nthem to see.\n                       PETER\n         Here's my license.\n                       COP #1\n         I'm afraid I'm going to have to\n         ask you to remain in the apartment.\n         The narcotics squad will be\n         arriving any moment now.

Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he\n     chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the\n     supermarket, whistling.\n\n62   EXT.

He throws all\n     the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of\n     his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.\n\n63   INT.

He has just finished\n     putting a regular diaper on her.\n     Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the\n     box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and\n     places it under Mary's bottom.\n     Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael\n     calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the\n     baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every-\n     thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be\n     very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper\n     covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics\n     agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to\n     notice something odd like this.\n     Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big\n     smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael\n     picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the\n     kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.\n\n                                                            62.\n\n                        MICHAEL\n          Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time\n          to go beddy-bye now...

Goddammit, Jerry, of course\n               winning the competition is\n               important to me! The firm's my\n               whole life if you must know. No,\n               no, please -- don't send anyone\n               over here... Don't you come either.\n               No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be\n               there in a half-hour, but I can't\n               stay long. No! Don't come here!\n               I'll be right over.\n     He hangs up.   Michael enters the room, with his coat on.\n                              MICHAEL\n\n                                                                65.\n\n              I gotta go over to    Mr. Oxman's --\n              he just called and    he's freaking\n              out. He says if I     don't bring\n              some cartoons over    now, the deal's\n              off.\n\n                            PETER\n              You're going now?\n                            MICHAEL\n              Yeah, but don't worry about it,\n              I'll be back before it's time\n              for her next bottle. She's asleep\n              now.\n                            PETER\n              Terrific, just terrific! Jerry\n              just called: I have to go to the\n              office right now.\n                            MICHAEL\n              Well, call him back. Tell him\n              you'll come later.\n                            PETER\n              There's no way. I can't, he's\n              suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman\n              and tell him you'll be there in a\n              few hours.\n                            MICHAEL\n              You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in\n              an hour. If I don't meet him\n              before then, I blow my 15,000\n              dollar contract.\n                            PETER\n              Oh shit, I can't take this\n              anymore!\n                            MICHAEL\n              Look, maybe we could pawn her off\n              on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a\n              couple of hours -- she's crazy\n              about her!\n                              PETER\n              Good idea!    Let's go.\n\n68   INT. BUILDING - DUSK                                  68\n     Peter and Michael get out of the elevator on Mrs.\n     Razzolini's floor. They each are holding one of the\n     handles on the basket. They are walking quickly.\n     Suddenly Michael stops Peter.\n\n                                                            66.\n\n                        MICHAEL\n          Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go\n          see...\nPeter waits with the basket.   Michael tiptoes to the\ncorner of the corridor.\n\nAt the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's\ndoorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with\nMrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their\nconversation.\n                        RAZZOLINI\n          Yes, I brought a package up to\n          them... I think it was last\n          Sunday...\n\n                        AGENT #1\n          What are these people like? What\n          kind of lifestyle do they have?\nMichael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes. He\nleads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator\nbutton.\n                        MICHAEL\n                 (whispering)\n          Just as I thought -- the goddamn\n          cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini.\n                        PETER\n          Oh shit! We sure as hell can't\n          hand her the baby with an ass full\n          of dope... right in front of the\n          narcs!\nThe elevator has arrived meanwhile.\n                        PETER\n                 (breaking down)\n          What should we do? I really gotta\n          go...\n                        MICHAEL\n          Listen, she's just had her bottle.\n          She's sleeping like a log. Let's\n          just leave her in the apartment.\n          What can possibly happen to her?\n          She's as regular as clockwork.\n          She won't wake up till 8:30 and\n          we'll easily be back by then...\n                        PETER\n          Yeah, you're right, we won't be\n          long.\nThey rush into the elevator.\n\n                                                                      67.\n\n\n\n69   EXT. STREET - DUSK                                          69\n     The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the\n     door of the apartment building.\n\n     The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and\n     walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael\n     emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three\n     men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the\n     building.\n\n70   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                      70\n\n     Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. He's about\n     to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the\n     door is already open.\n                              PETER\n               Michael?   Michael, are you here?\n     No answer.\n     Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his\n     eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit\n     the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been\n     smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti-\n     ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In\n     its place, utter devastation and shambles.\n     Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful\n     thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his\n     room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris\n     and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into\n     the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's\n     nowhere to be seen.\n     Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan-\n     ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's\n     room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is\n     nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth\n     ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his\n     eyes.\n     Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES.   They're coming from the\n     back bathroom. Peter rushes to   it, practically ripping\n     the door from its hinges. There   on the toilet is the\n     basket, and on it there's a note  written in big messy\n     printing which says: \"NEXT TIME   WE TAKE HER.\"\n     Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape.\n     A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and\n     kisses her all over as he takes her into his room.\n     Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and\n\n                                                                      68.\n\n     overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's    room and\n     looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been    caught\n     kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from   her, hold-\n     ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on    his bed\n     and exits the room.\n\n\n71   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                        71\n     The debris has been shoved up against the walls. Peter\n     and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped\n     over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle.\n     Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her\n     for the first time.\n\n\n72   INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   72\n     Peter is in bed, completely out of it.\n     Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one\n     diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He\n     lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on\n     the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body.\n     Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out.\n     Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and\n     he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter\n     switches off the light.\n\n73   INT. APARTMENT - DAWN                                       73\n     The DOORBELL RINGS.\n     Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the\n     middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and\n     glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM.      He staggers to the\n     front door and opens it. The door is     being held together\n     with a string.\n     Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other\n     cops backing them up.\n     Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide-\n     eyed, a look of horror on her face.\n                             MICHAEL\n               Morning, officers. Can I help\n               you?\n                             AGENT #1\n                      (holding out a piece\n                       of paper to him)\n               Search warrant.\n                             MICHAEL\n\n                                                                69.\n\n                      (playing  the gentleman,\n                       waving  away the paper)\n               I believe you,  officer. Go ahead,\n               we have nothing  to hide. Hello,\n               Mrs. Razzolini!\n\n     Mrs. Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away.\n     The cops enter the apartment.\n                             MICHAEL\n               You'll have to excuse the mess...\n               We had a few friends over last night...\n                             AGENT #1\n                      (looking at the\n                       devastation)\n               Oh, really? Well, if I were you\n               I'd get myself some new friends!\n     Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.\n                             PETER\n               What the hell are you guys looking\n               for, anyway?\n                             AGENT #1\n               Probably the same things your\n               friends were looking for last\n               night! Didn't Mrs. Razzolini\n               bring you a package last Sunday?\n                             PETER\n               You mean the chocolate Easter\n               bunnies? We ate them already.\n     He starts to walk away.\n                             PETER\n               Anyway, you have no idea how many\n               packages we've been getting lately.\n               It's hard to keep track of them.\n                             AGENT #1\n               Maybe we can help.\n                      (to his colleagues)\n               Let's get to work!\n     All the cops enter the apartment.\n\n74   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                             74\n     Peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. A narcotics\n     AGENT is rummaging through his scattered belongings.\n                             AGENT\n               Would you mind if I look in your\n\n                                                                     70.\n\n               bed?\n                             PETER\n                      (big smile)\n               My pleasure. Try not to make a\n               mess.\n\n     Peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it\n     in his hands. The Agent searches the bed.\n                             AGENT\n               I'll look in the basket, if you\n               don't mind...\n                              PETER\n               Be my guest.\n\n     He picks up Mary with her huge diaper.   The Agent\n     searches the whole basket.\n                             AGENT\n               Thank you very much, sorry about\n               this...\n     He goes out.   Peter, undaunted, pats Mary's big behind.\n\n75   INT.

Really?\n\n                             PETER\n               They just said that to put us off\n               guard.

So that\n               means we've still got it.\n                             MICHAEL\n               But he said the investigation was\n               closed.\n                             PETER\n               Okay, let's just see how closed\n               it is. I'll go downstairs. You\n               watch out the window and see if\n               I'm being tailed.\n\n76   EXT.

Peter comes out of the building and turns left,\n     walking very quickly.\n     Suddenly, Peter stops, turns     around and retraces his\n     steps. We can clearly see a      man, who was walking about\n     six yards behind Peter on the     opposite side of the\n     street, also turn around and     retrace his steps.\n     It is Graton.\n\n77   INT.

I look\n               ridiculous.\n                             PETER\n               You look completely ridiculous\n               -- so what?\n\n86   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                     86\n\n     MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the\n     couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next  to her, also in his\n     coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package\n     which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a\n     baby rattle, and a clean diaper.\n     Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk\n     hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing\n     out the window leading to the fire escape.\n\n87   EXT. STREET - DAY                                          87\n     Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little\n     woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry-\n     ing his plastic bag.\n     Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.\n                             GRATON\n               Okay, he's coming out alone.\n               I'll follow him. Someone else\n               stay here to keep an eye on the\n               other guys.\n\n88   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    88\n     Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with\n     Mary on her blanket near him.\n     Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,\n     watching them out of the corner of his eye.\n     Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.\n     The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around\n     a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and\n     their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few\n     yards away and they begin \"making out.\"\n\n                                                            80.\n\nMichael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-\ntiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside\nhim. He puts the clean diaper on her.\nGraton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the\npassersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come\nrunning up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown\npackage out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them.\nThe two punks immediately take off with the package.\nGraton leaps up, shouts \"let's get 'em\" and takes off\nafter the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes\ndetectives, who'd been hiding all around.\nMichael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly\ndeposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving\nthe punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off\nin the direction of the    cops.\nThe punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the\ndiaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and\ngoes off in the opposite direction.\nThe cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put\nup no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.\n                        MICHAEL\n          What's going on?\n                        GRATON\n          Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do\n          you admit you gave these men this\n          package?\n                       MICHAEL\n          Sure. I gave it to them, just a\n          moment ago.\n                        GRATON\n                 (to one of the cops)\n          Officer, will you please open this\n          package in front of these witnesses?\nThe cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate\nEaster bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all\nthe bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate\ninside them.\n                        MICHAEL\n          Is it against the law to give a\n          box of candy to my friends?\nPeter and Jack take off their glasses.\n                        GRATON\n          Oh, it's you guys!\n\n                                                                    81.\n\n\n                             PETER\n               What's the problem?\n                             GRATON\n               You guys must think you're pretty\n               smart, don't ya?\n                      (suddenly freezes)\n               Holy shit! The diaper!\n     Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.\n     He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where\n     Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the\n     trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the\n     garbage around like a lunatic.\n\n                             GRATON\n               The goddam diaper! What a jerk,\n               what a goddam schmuck I am!\n     Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives\n     watch Graton going bananas.\n                             MICHAEL\n                      (to the cops)\n               I think that guy needs a vacation.\n                             JACK\n               He should try South America.\n                             PETER\n               Yeah, I hear it's nice there this\n               time of year.\n\n89   INT. GRATON'S BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY                         89\n     The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with\n     anger, and Graton sheepishly faces him.\n                             CHIEF\n               Let's face it... Graton... You've\n               got shit for brains.\n                             GRATON\n               I'm sure the dope was in the\n               diaper.

APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        90\n     In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as\n     a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around\n     in circles with each other and laughing. They are\n     singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-\n     monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael,\n     holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to\n     him and starts turning around in circles with him.\n     MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is\n     LAUGHING her head off.\n     In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk\n     getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand\n     and is a little smashed.\n                             JACK\n               Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen,\n               I brought you back a little present\n               from South America. Can I see you\n               right away so I can give it to you?\n               ...

EAST RIVER - EVENING                                   91\n     A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul\n     is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up\n     and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.\n     Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him\n     with a forceful shove flying into the water.   Paul lands\n     on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the\n     surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over   the water\n     and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk.\n                             JACK\n               That was for your 'little' package,\n               and consider yourself lucky I\n               didn't turn you in to the cops!\n               And get one thing into your thick\n               skull: I have never touched dope,\n\n                                                                   83.\n\n               and I never will.

So long.\n\n     Jack turns his back on Paul and staggers off.\n                             PAUL\n               Hey, come back! -- how'm I gonna\n               get out of here?\n                             JACK\n               Crawl.\n\n\n92   INT.

How do you figure that?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nShouldn't I be discussing all this\nwith the father?\n              PETER\nWell, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm...\nBrainsore...\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nBretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.\n              PETER\nRight... Bratsnot, lemme tell\nyou something. With a child you\nalways know who the mother is,\nbut the father -- that's another\nkettle of fish. So don't give me\nthat bullshit, okay?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nVery well. I won't discuss it any\nfurther with you. Will you please\nshow me where the kitchen and the\nbathroom are?\n               PETER\nWhat for?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nSo I can make you a list of the\nthings we need.\n              PETER\nWhat do you mean, make you a list?\n-- Don't you do the shopping\nyourself?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nNo shopping or laundry or\nhousekeeping. I am a professional\nnanny.\n              PETER\nWe have plenty of everything.\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nDo you have a sufficient amount\nof fruit and vegetables for the\nchild?\n              PETER\nShe only eats milk and cereal.\n\n                                        94.\n\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nThat's not enough, sir. From\nthe age of three months children\nshould be started on a normal,\nvaried diet.\n\n              PETER\nOh that's bullshit. You don't\nfeed a baby like an adult.\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\n       (mockingly)\nOh, really? And how would you\nknow?\n              PETER\nI've read plenty of books. The\ndiet recommended by those quack\npediatricians today is way too\nrich. I'm in favor of natural\nmethods, Mrs. Breathmint.\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nBretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.\n              PETER\nFor instance, if a child is having\ntrouble getting to sleep, what\nwould you do?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nDepends, if it was a continuing\nproblem, I might recommend a\nmild sedative...\n              PETER\n       (exploding,\n        triumphantly)\nI knew you'd say something like\nthat, you jerk!\n              MRS.    BRETSAWS\nFine. Anything you     say, sir.\nLet me just remind    you that I have\nmy diploma and that    medicine is\na serious matter.\n              PETER\nDo you know the song that goes\n'Medicine's a whore and the\npharmacist is her pimp'?\n              MRS. BRETSAWS\nNo, I don't. We must listen to\ndifferent music. Personally I'm\nvery fond of opera.\n\n                                                                    95.\n\n                              PETER\n                Mrs. Breakballs, if you don't\n                get out of here right this minute\n                I'm gonna punch you in the nose!\n                This is my home, now get out!\n\n                              MRS.

Never! I'd rather be a\nsubway conductor.\n              PETER\n       (barking)\nThen dump her in an orphanage,\n'cause there's no way we're gonna\ntake care of her all by ourselves\nanymore!\n              MICHAEL\nCome on, stop arguing, you two!\nJack, you're going to have to\nask to do the New York-Washington\nshu...\n               JACK\n        (stubborn, yelling)\nNo!   Never.\n              MICHAEL\n       (unruffled)\nThat way, you can do the 6-10 A.M.\nshift. That amounts to two bottles\nand two diaper changes.

He runs into\n      his friend Paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a\n      potential mishap with   Jack.\n                               PAUL\n                       (shyly)\n                Hi, Jack, something wrong?\n\n                                                                        98.\n\n                              JACK\n                       (who hadn't\n                        noticed him)\n                Oh, hi...

Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches\n      him go, totally confused.\n\n105   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 105\n      Jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown.\n      He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms. The basket is on\n      the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary back\n      in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits\n      back down again and doesn't move. Mary falls back asleep.\n      Jack looks at her skin, her hands. Very gently, he\n      kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep.\n\n106   INT.

Michael is\n       diapering Mary on her   changing table. She's naked.\n       He tickles her, bites   her toes, neck and ears; she\n       bursts out laughing.    Michael is totally gaga over her.\n\n                                                                   100.\n\n                               MICHAEL\n                 Coochie, coochie, coo... woo,\n                 woo, woo... bippity, boppity\n                 boo...\n      Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward\n      his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears\n      Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's.\n      Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and\n      listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as\n      though he were just coming out of his room.\n                               PETER\n                 Hi, Michael, I just came back\n                 to get a file I forgot...\n\n      Michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud-\n      denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty.

BATHROOM - EVENING                                108\n      Peter enters the bathroom. He's carrying Mary, who's\n      naked and wrapped in a towel.\n\n                                                                     101.\n\n      Peter carefully locks the door behind him. He removes\n      Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled\n      with warm water.\n      Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water.\n      Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water\n      on her shoulders and head. The water streams down her\n      face. She blinks and laughs. Peter whispers lovingly\n      to her in a barely audible, very low voice. Mary\n      stares at him.\n                                                   FADE OUT.\n\n      FADE IN:\n\n109   SAME SCENE - MONTHS LATER                                109\n      Peter is wearing a different suit and Mary is almost\n      one-year-old, with a lot more hair on her head, and\n      able to sit up a lot better.\n\n110   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 110\n      Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed\n      a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the\n      comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping...\n      Suddenly, from the direction of    the living room, we can\n      hear MARY CRYING. Jack emerges     from under the comforter\n      and switches on the light: he     has a female guest in\n      his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this    time.\n                               JACK\n                        (to himself)\n                 Shit, she's crying...\n                                 BRUNETTE\n                 What?\n                               JACK\n                 Nothing, nothing. I'll be right\n                 back.\n      He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the\n      bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He\n      goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers\n      her with kisses.\n      Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on\n      Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her\n      for a moment then puts her back to bed.\n      Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly\n      picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted\n      by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again.\n\n                                                                    102.\n\n      Mary cries again.\n                              JACK\n                It' beddy-bye time now, honey,\n                beddy-bye, don't cry, sweetheart...\n\n      Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again.

Michael, as a routine,\n      sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes.\n      They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony,\n      as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven.\n      She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her\n      thumb.\n\n111   INT.

One of the\n      men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out\n      toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She\n      seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them\n      goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out\n      of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave.\n      When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and\n      showers her with kisses.\n                              SYLVIA\n                Here you are, my angel... Are you\n                okay, honey? Mommy's finished\n                now, you've been a very, very\n                good girl.\n                       (to Guard)\n                Thanks a lot for looking after\n                her.\n                              GUARD\n                Oh, she's been great!\n      She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly\n      takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them\n      into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and\n      a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes\n      the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self\n      again.\n      She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door.\n      Michael stands frozen.\n\n128   INT.

He is full of energy and playful excite-\n      ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and\n      women. They say good night to each other.\n      Everyone goes into his or her own room.\n\n      Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His\n      smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking.\n      He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little\n      chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads \"Merry\n      Christmas. The Marriott Hotels.\" Jack contemplates\n      it forlornly.\n\n129   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                             129\n\n      Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in\n      front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper,\n      in Michael's room. The bed in unmade.\n      Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking\n      away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth.\n      Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin.\n      His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles\n      come together and start looking like a baby lying in a\n      crib.\n      Sophia is absorbed in her monologue.\n      Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples\n      the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia\n      hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.\n\n130   INT.

There is a LOUD SQUEAKING noise.\n      She reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber\n      giraffe.\n                              NATALIE\n                What the hell is this?

He feels the\n      tears coming to his eyes. Grabbing the giraffe, he\n      hurls it with all his might against the wall.\n\n131   INT.

Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper\nand a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing\nwith an empty pack of cigarettes.

Dinner's ready!\n      Still no answer. Michael opens the door:      Peter's lying\n      face-down on his bed.\n      He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael\n      and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face\n      in his arm.\n      Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their\n      steaks, totally depressed.\n\n138   INT.
