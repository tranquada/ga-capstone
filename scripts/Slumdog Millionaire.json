The ceiling\n     fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable\n     Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot\n     work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks\n     in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen\n     pretty much everything.

Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas\n     again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When\n     the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector\n     goes over to Jamal's collapsed form.

Jamal\n     adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of\n     nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as\n     it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is\n     knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The\n     ball bounces away.

Many of the precarious upper floors of the\n     shacks have been built right over the paths, turning\n     them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with\n     slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be\n     lost and frightened in minutes.\n\n     But these children are natives and with the practice of\n     many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of\n     lanes.\n\n     They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,\n     sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a\n     naked four year-old, pissing into the drain.

Not so the Security Guard who gets it\n     all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.\n\n     The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof\n     with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They\n     break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the\n     slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,\n     stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,\n     drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,\n     playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting\n     and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new\n     Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands\n     Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his\n     two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their\n     hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so\n     carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.\n\n     Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides\n     carefully past the car with deprecating bows and\n     smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has\n     gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv\n     rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets\n     tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give\n     him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the\n     tv before scooting down another tunnel.

A\n     middle class Indian couple with their three children\n     are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before\n     them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes\n     Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is\n     clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train\n     roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim\n     who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open\n     window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be\n     hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.\n\n     Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children\n     spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,\n     she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand\n     which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,\n     Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding\n     onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.\n     Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles\n     and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and\n     tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.\n     Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are\n     images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-\n\n     - huddled together against the freezing rain...\n\n     - surfing the wind at the front of the train...\n\n     - admiring the distant Himalaya....\n\n<b>                             JAMAL V/O\n</b>               We criss-crossed the country\n               from Rajasthan to Calcutta.\n               Every time we were thrown off we\n               got back on again.

Somehow in the\n     tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.\n     And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze\n     of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the\n     distance- something impossibly beautiful.\n\n<b>                             JAMAL\n</b>               Salim?

Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from\n     the group.\n\n\n<b>98   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                        98\n</b>\n     They go into one of the tiny houses.
