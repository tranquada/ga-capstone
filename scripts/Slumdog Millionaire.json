JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1\n\n    An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold\n    taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.\n    Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of\n    thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on\n    the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other\n    side.\n\n                               JAVED O/S\n              Salim! Salim!\n\n\n2   INT. STUDIO.

JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3\n\n    The thumping at the door continues. The sound of\n    mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand\n    cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the\n    chamber, snaps the chamber shut.\n\n                            TALKBACK V/O\n              ...three, two, one, zero.

On\n    stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man\n    stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for\n    the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem\n    Kumar.\n\n                               PREM\n                 Welcome to Who Wants To Be A\n                 Millionaire!\n\n    More applause.\n\n                               PREM (CONT'D)\n                 Please give a warm welcome to\n                 our first contestant of the\n                 night- a local from our very own\n                 Mumbai!\n\n    Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal\n    towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.\n\n                                  PREM (CONT'D)\n                 Smile, dammit.\n\n    The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a\n    tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him\n    ferociously across the face. Then again and again.\n    Blood trickles from his mouth.\n\n\n5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5\n\n    The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the\n    harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung\n    from the ceiling by his arms.\n\n                               CONSTABLE SRINIVAS\n                 Your name, bhen chod.\n\n    Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by\n    the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the\n    lights.\n\n                                  CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)\n                 Your name!\n\n                                  JAMAL\n                 Jamal Malik.\n\n    And seamlessly we are back....\n\n                                                           3.\n\n\n6   INT.

Jamal sits opposite, frozen.\n\n                            PREM\n              So, Jamal, tell us a bit about\n              yourself.\n\n    Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved\n    under water.\n\n\n7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7\n\n    We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the\n    screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes\n    desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged\n    up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.\n\n                            JAMAL V/O\n              I work in a call centre.

POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.                          10\n\n     Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His\n     head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling\n     fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable\n     Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot\n     work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks\n     in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen\n     pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised.\n\n                                INSPECTOR\n                  Has he confessed, yet?\n\n                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS\n                  Apart from his name, I can't get\n                  a word out of the runt.\n\n                                INSPECTOR\n                  You've been here all bloody\n                  night, Srinivas.

The Inspector stares, deep in\n     thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away\n     with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.\n\n                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                  Every night I get home, \"why\n                  can't we have a/c like Bajan\n                  Chacha?\n                                (MORE)\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           5.\n10   CONTINUED:                                                 10\n                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                  Why don't you care about your\n                  poor family, dying in this\n                  heat.\" Twenty-four years a\n                  policeman and I can't afford\n                  bloody a/c.\n\n     Turns on Jamal.\n\n                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                  But you.

Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He\n     screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes\n     over to Jamal.\n\n                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                  So. Were you wired up? A mobile\n                  or a pager, correct? Some little\n                  hidden gadget? No? A coughing\n                  accomplice in the audience?\n                  Microchip under the skin, huh?\n\n     Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs\n     Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until\n     the Inspector has had enough.\n\n                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                  Srinivas!

Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas\n     again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When\n     the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector\n     goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers\n     in front of Jamal's face to check for a response.\n\n                                INSPECTOR OF POLICE\n                  He's unconscious, chutiya.

Slum Dog Millionaire.\n\n\n11   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                  11\n\n     Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present\n     Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on\n     a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in\n     little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their\n     feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his\n     almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising\n     speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.\n     The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.\n\n                             SALIM\n               Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!\n\n     The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks\n     around trying to get into position.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            7.\n11   CONTINUED:                                                  11\n\n     He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are\n     scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball\n     seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other\n     children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that\n     they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal\n     adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of\n     nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as\n     it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is\n     knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The\n     ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his\n     feet.\n\n                                SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  How could you drop that? It was\n                  a sitter.\n\n     Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.\n\n\n12   EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.                                12\n\n     At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of\n     wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running\n     for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly\n     nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming\n     abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a\n     rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes\n     that run in between the shacks of the slum.\n\n                                SECURITY GUARD\n                  Private-ka land! Private-ka\n                  land! The planes won't kill you,\n                  mader chod, I will!\n\n     Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off,\n     head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.\n\n\n13   INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                        13\n\n     The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are\n     three feet wide, with an open drain running down the\n     middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the\n     shacks have been built right over the paths, turning\n     them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with\n     slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be\n     lost and frightened in minutes.\n\n     But these children are natives and with the practice of\n     many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of\n     lanes.\n\n     They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,\n     sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a\n     naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim\n     shouts a warning.\n\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          8.\n13   CONTINUED:                                                13\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Vinod! Musketeers coming\n                  through!\n\n     Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the\n     stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it\n     all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.\n\n     The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof\n     with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They\n     break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the\n     slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,\n     stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,\n     drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,\n     playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting\n     and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new\n     Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands\n     Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his\n     two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their\n     hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so\n     carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.\n\n     Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides\n     carefully past the car with deprecating bows and\n     smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has\n     gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv\n     rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets\n     tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give\n     him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the\n     tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out\n     into sunlight again.\n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE\n                  Jamal!\n\n     Jamal skids to a halt, bumping into Salim who is\n     already frozen.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Shit. Mummy-ji.\n\n                                JAMAL'S MOTHER\n                  Don't you move a muscle.\n\n     The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt\n     at the sight of Jamal's mother.\n\n                                JAMAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)\n                  Thank you, Mister Gupta. I will\n                  deal with these two.\n\n     The Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect\n     as Jamal's Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor\n     by their t-shirt and marches them down the road.\n\n                                                            9.\n\n\n14   INT.

We\n               are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos,\n               isn't it?\n\n     He crashes the heavy book down on his head. Salim opens\n     the book. Jamal glances over and turns the book the\n     right way round for Salim.\n\n                             SALIM\n               I know!\n\n     Mister Nandha hovers over Jamal's head.

Jamal watches Srinivas\n     fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a\n     picture. Through the pebbled glass, Jamal sees shapes\n     moving along the corridor.\n\n\n16   INT. CORRIDOR.

He\n     jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's\n     worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out\n     the mire. He runs for the helicopter.\n\n                                JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji!\n\n     Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a\n     way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for\n     Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits\n     of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him\n     and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and\n     there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan\n     getting out of the helicopter.\n\n                                JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  Please.

He takes the\n     flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.\n\n                                JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji.\n\n     He hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards\n     surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases\n     the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it.\n\n\n22   EXT. JUHU SLUM.

He\n     glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the\n     hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips\n     Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look\n     and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the\n     money in his pocket, slinks away.\n\n\n24   EXT. JUHU SLUM.

We need rain.\n\n     Jamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and\n     Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having\n     much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim\n     to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes\n     underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his\n     head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops,\n     listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something\n     strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading\n     catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's\n     mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of\n     shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but\n     getting louder. A frozen moment broken by:\n\n                                MOTHER (CONT'D)\n                  Run! Jamal, Salim, run!\n\n     Everybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she\n     continues to shout, her words lost beneath the\n     thundering train.\n\n                                MOTHER (CONT'D)\n                  Go! Run!\n\n     The train goes through, the last carriage flying past\n     suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men\n     wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come\n     screaming across the railway tracks.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Krishna, quick!\n\n     Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with\n     difficulty through the water.\n\n                                KRISHNA\n                  No way!

Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a\n     rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men\n     who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags\n     Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they\n     get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three-\n     year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish\n     blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a\n     bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in\n     a pair of pants runs after them.\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         21.\n31   CONTINUED: (2)                                            31\n\n     She has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn\n     a corner and head towards some vans full of police.\n     Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops.\n\n                                JAMAL\n               Salim!\n\n     Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis\n     of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.\n\n                                JAMAL (CONT'D)\n               Mister Nandha.\n\n     Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.\n\n                             MISTER NANDHA\n               Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid\n               dhvasth hai.\n\n                                JAMAL\n               Mister Nandha?\n\n                             MISTER NANDHA\n               We have destroyed your mosque.\n               Now, the followers of Ram will\n               drive you dogs out of our city.\n\n     From behind his back he produces a knife and runs\n     towards Jamal, screaming.\n\n                             MISTER NANDHA (CONT'D)\n               Ram has returned to his temple!\n               Ram has returned!\n\n     They flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He\n     chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell\n     broken, and they are off.\n\n\n32   INT. STREET. EVENING.                                     32\n\n     They reach the safety of the police vans. But inside\n     the vans, the police are smoking, laughing, playing\n     cards. Down the street, a man comes whirling out of a\n     doorway, his hair on fire. He falls into the middle of\n     the street and is engulfed by rioters. Unperturbed, the\n     police continue to chat. Salim and Jamal look on,\n     horrified. Then one of the police men turns, looks at\n     them. Is interested. Motions to a colleague. Puts out\n     his cigarette with purpose.\n\n                             JAMAL\n               Let's go, bhai.\n\n     Salim and Jamal run.

Standing a little way off is the girl.\n\n                              JAMAL\n                We should go back.\n\n     Silence.\n\n                              JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                See if Ama-\n\n     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a\n     moment.

Picks up a rock and\n     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps\n     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds\n     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.\n\n                              SALIM (CONT'D)\n                Ja!\n\n     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across\n     the city.

Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a\n     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their\n     faces.\n\n\n34   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                 34\n\n     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes\n     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,\n     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,\n     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap\n     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the\n     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Go away.

His breathing slows and he sees the girl\n     staring at him. Salim, too, is staring into nothing.\n     The rain is still falling.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           24.\n36   CONTINUED:                                                  36\n\n     The girl goes back to drawing shapes in the mud with\n     her finger. Jamal climbs out of the pipe. Looks at\n     Salim for permission or refusal, but he just continues\n     to stare. So, Jamal walks across to her. She looks up,\n     wary.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Where's your Mother?\n\n     Silence.\n\n                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  Father?\n\n     The girl shakes her head slightly. Jamal takes the\n     plastic sheet from around his shoulders. Gives it to\n     her.\n\n                                JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  I'm Jamal.

Sighs, motions for her to\n     join him. She darts across, jumps into the water pipe\n     and huddles up next to Jamal.\n\n\n37   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.

Salim is standing on his shoulders and\n     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a\n     certain lack of confidence.\n\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          33.\n49   CONTINUED:                                                 49\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Four, nine, zero, nine- the one\n                  with the stick going down, Salim-\n                  six- stick going up-\n\n     Latika's head appears from around the corner.\n\n                                 LATIKA\n                        (whispered)\n                  Oi!\n\n     But they don't hear. Then she is running for her life\n     past the pair of them.\n\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Six, one, shit, let's go-\n\n     Salim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run\n     off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on\n     adverts all reading: \"Beanbags- 989 4909661\". A fat\n     Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the\n     corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except\n     through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a\n     private house.\n\n                                SECURITY GUARD\n                  Got you now, little shits.\n\n\n50   EXT. GARDEN. NIGHT.                                        50\n\n     They charge across the lawn, down one side of the house\n     where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught\n     up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through\n     to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to\n     safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's\n     dress from the line.\n\n                                SECURITY GUARD\n                  Aha! Little thief!\n\n     The Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's\n     back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn,\n     dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up.\n\n                                SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)\n                  Pervert!\n\n\n51   INT. ALLEY. NIGHT.                                         51\n\n     Jamal is examing the bruises on his legs.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Useless bloody look-out.

Spins. Both of them look up.\n     Stare. She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed\n     into a beautiful girl.\n\n\n52   EXT. GORAI BEACH DUMPING GROUND. DAY.                     52\n\n     Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of\n     rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for\n     ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks,\n     Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each\n     one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress\n     is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig\n     another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares.\n     Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes\n     through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who\n     waves, pulls up in the dump. \"Hope Orphanage is written\n     on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.\n\n\n53   INT. `TENT'. DAY.                                         53\n\n     Under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, Jamal and\n     Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day.\n     Jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him- a\n     silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. Out of his\n     bag, the man produces a bottle of Thumbs Up. He uncaps\n     it with an alluring hiss. It is almost an advert for\n     thirst-quenching affluence. Almost instinctively, Salim\n     and Jamal stir.\n\n                                MAN\n                  Hello.\n\n     He hands the bottle to Salim, gets another from his bag\n     and waves it questioningly at Jamal.\n\n                                MAN (CONT'D)\n                  Hot, huh?

The pick-up truck pulls\n     up outside a building with Jamal, Salim and Latika\n     sitting on a bench in the back. Maman gets out. Drops\n     the gate on the back of the pick-up.\n\n                                MAMAN\n                  Anyone hungry? Come on in.\n\n                                                          35.\n\n\n55   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                         55\n\n     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a\n     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and\n     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He\n     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with\n     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning\n     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks\n     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or\n     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on\n     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.\n\n                             JAMAL\n               He must be a very good man to\n               look after these people.\n\n                             SALIM\n                    (glancing at them)\n               A saint.\n\n     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim\n     overhears.\n\n                             ARVIND\n               We're not allowed to talk to\n               them.\n\n                                LATIKA\n               Why not?\n\n     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman\n     who is looking right at them.\n\n                             LATIKA (CONT'D)\n               Well, if there are seconds,\n               Maman is definitely a Saint.\n\n     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he\n     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.\n     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out\n     laughing.\n\n                             LATIKA (CONT'D)\n               I tell you, Lord Siva is with\n               us.\n\n\n56   INT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                   56\n\n     Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are\n     standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set\n     to music. Maman is leading the singing, walking up and\n     down the line listening to each one individually. He\n     stops at one small boy, Arvind, and listens. Nods his\n     head, pleased, and continues down the line until he\n     stops in front of Jamal. Holds up his hand.\n\n                             MAMAN\n               Stop! You. Again.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          36.\n56   CONTINUED:                                                 56\n\n     Jamal starts singing again. He has the sweetest of\n     voices. Untrained but pure. Maman smiles, ruffles\n     Jamal's hair, impressed.\n\n                                  MAMAN (CONT'D)\n                  Everyone.\n\n     They all join in. Maman continues down the line. He\n     stops at Salim whose octave-slipping singing is lusty\n     and appallingly out of tune. Maman winces and moves on.\n     Standing next to Salim, Latika giggles. Immediately,\n     Salim is on her. Before a fight breaks out, Punnoose\n     pulls Salim off Latika and hurls him across the room.\n     Salim gets up and charges at Punnoose. For a second,\n     Punnoose is back-footed, but then pins Salim's arms to\n     his side. Maman laughs. Approaches Salim.\n\n                                MAMAN (CONT'D)\n                  You sing like one, and you fight\n                  like one. I think you've found\n                  your dog, Punnoose.\n\n\n57   EXT. CENTRAL MUMBAI TRAFFIC. DAY.                          57\n\n     A group of children are sitting in the jumble of\n     concrete under a motorway flyover. Cars surround them,\n     bumper to bumper. Latika and Jamal are playing an\n     improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. They are\n     giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.\n     Salim and Punnoose are sitting together, smoking. Salim\n     is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose\n     grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Okay, let's go, let's go! It's\n                  not a bloody holiday!\n\n     The children get to their feet. Latika sighs, puts a\n     patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.\n     Suddenly, the lame beggar. Salim goes over to one of\n     the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. Puts out\n     his hand.\n\n                                  SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  Give me that.\n\n     The girl shakes her head. Salim grabs her by the hair\n     in one hand and takes the baby with the other. He\n     shoves her to the ground. The other children stare.\n\n                                  JAMAL\n                  Hey, Salim!\n\n     He challenges Jamal.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  What, chot\u00e9 bhai? You got a\n                  problem?\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        37.\n57   CONTINUED:                                                57\n\n     He laughs and walks over to Latika.\n\n                                   SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  Here. For you.\n\n                                LATIKA\n                  I don't want it.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  You'll earn double. I'm doing\n                  you a favour, Latika.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  She doesn't want it.\n\n                                   SALIM\n                  Chup, Jamal.\n\n     Latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.\n\n                                   SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  I'll drop it.\n\n     He holds the baby up. Latika grabs the baby with a cry\n     just as Salim releases it from his hands. Salim pinches\n     the baby.\n\n                                SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  Triple if it's crying.\n\n     Latika snatches it away. Salim laughs, goes back to\n     sitting with Punnoose. The children scatter to the cars\n     trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the\n     windows and making the universal begging gesture.\n\n\n58   INT. ORPHANAGE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                           58\n\n     Surrounded by beer bottles, Punnoose is slumped asleep\n     by the kitchen door. Latika edges past, avoids the cook\n     sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with\n     vegetables. She pulls down a bunch of chillies still on\n     the vine, strips a few off and tip-toes out with them.\n\n\n59   INT. ORPHANAGE. DORMITORY. NIGHT.                         59\n\n     Sleeping children, three or four to a mattress on the\n     floor. Latika tip-toes around the mattresses. She\n     pauses over one in particular where we see Salim,\n     asleep. She carefully pulls up the sheet, delves\n     underneath. Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face\n     for a second. Then suddenly, he is bolt upright and\n     screaming. He charges around the room clutching his\n     genitals in agony.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Madher chod...!\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           38.\n59   CONTINUED:                                                  59\n\n     He sprints out of the room, wailing.\n\n\n60   INT. ORPHANAGE. SHOWERS. NIGHT.                             60\n\n     The lights are on and two dozen children are screaming\n     with laughter as Salim stands under the make-shift\n     shower directing the water down his pants to his\n     burning genitals, his face a picture of agony. Latika\n     wipes crushed chillies from her hands.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  You're dead, sala.\n\n     She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug. Then\n     Punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter\n     away.\n\n                                PUNNOOSE\n                  Get back to bed, dogs!

SHACK. NIGHT.                                          61\n\n     In a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in\n     front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged\n     appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit\n     behind Arvind.\n\n                                MAMAN\n                  Very good, very good. I am\n                  pleased, Arvind. He is ready.\n\n                                ARVIND\n                  Ready?\n\n     Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round,\n     Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after\n     the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The\n     villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the\n     lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it.\n     Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb.\n     Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and\n     passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with\n     a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with\n     the cloth nods to Punnoose.\n\n                                PUNNOOSE\n                  Salim!\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           39.\n61   CONTINUED:                                                  61\n\n     Utterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay\n     Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of\n     Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon\n     close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of\n     the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager\n     is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag.\n\n                                MAMAN\n                  Okay. Take him out the back.\n\n     Punnoose picks up Arvind and carries him out.\n\n                                MAMAN (CONT'D)\n                  Now the other one.

The money,\n                  the women, the cars...you want\n                  them bad, huh? And why not?\n\n     Maman gets out of his chair. Approaches Salim.\n\n                                MAMAN (CONT'D)\n                  The time has come to choose,\n                  yaar. The life of a slum dog or\n                  the life of a man. A real man. A\n                  gunfighter, Salim.\n\n     Maman holds Salim's head in his hands.\n\n                                MAMAN (CONT'D)\n                  Your destiny is in your hands,\n                  bhai.

Punnoose appears at the door.\n     Maman nods to him and he slips off after Salim.\n\n\n62   INT. DORMITORY, ORPHANAGE. NIGHT.                           62\n\n     All the children are asleep apart from Jamal who is\n     crouched underneath a couple of wash-basins.\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          40.\n62   CONTINUED:                                                 62\n\n     He is talking through a plate-sized hole in the\n     crumbling masonry. Latika's eyes can be seen.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  ...weddings, government things,\n                  big parties.

Nods his head at Jamal.\n\n                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                  It's my turn.\n\n                                LATIKA\n                  Good luck, Jamal.\n\n     Latika's hand comes through the gap. Jamal takes it for\n     a moment. Salim hisses at Jamal. He lets go of the hand\n     and heads out.\n\n\n63   EXT. PATH. NIGHT.                                          63\n\n     Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming\n     happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose\n     following.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  So, this is it, hey, bhai?

Punnoose slips in\n     behind Salim.\n\n                                MAMAN\n                  Jamal, hello. You have done\n                  well.

Holds out\n     his hand.\n\n                                  JAMAL\n                  Fifty rupees.\n\n                                  MAMAN\n                  What?\n\n                                JAMAL\n                       (shrugs)\n                  I've turned professional.

NIGHT.                                        65\n\n     Outside, a giggle. Latika is peering through a gap in\n     the wall.\n\n                                                          42.\n\n\n66    INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66\n\n      Jamal begins to sing. Maman waits a while, then nods to\n      Punnoose. Behind Jamal, Punnoose hands Salim the bottle\n      of chloroform and the rag. Salim approaches the back of\n      Jamal. Salim waits until he has finished the song.\n      Raises his hand with the rag in it. Maman smiles, nods.\n      Salim flings the contents of the bottle in Punnoose's\n      face. Punnoose screams and stumbles back clutching his\n      eyes, knocking over the table.\n\n                                SALIM\n                Go!\n\n      Salim and Jamal scramble for the door. The knocked-over\n      candle catches the spilled chloroform and a curtain\n      which whooshes up in flame.\n\n                                LATIKA\n                Jamal!\n\n                                JAMAL\n                Run!\n\n\n66A   EXT.

NIGHT.                                     67\n\n      Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall\n      into holes. The three children are running. Branches\n      smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing\n      will stop them. Behind them, torches scour the\n      undergrowth. Men shouting. They break out of the woods\n      and are confronted with a train goods yard.\n\n\n68    EXT. GOODS YARD. NIGHT.                                   68\n\n      They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the\n      shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel\n      engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and\n      Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of\n      the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is\n      fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his\n      hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his\n      hand out to Latika.\n\n                              JAMAL\n                Come on! Faster!\n\n      She reaches out to him.

Take it! I can't\n                  reach...\n\n     Salim barges Jamal out of the way. Jamal      stumbles back\n     as Salim reaches his hand out to Latika,      so he doesn't\n     see Latika's hand grasp Salim's, nor see      their eyes\n     lock onto each other, nor see Salim very      deliberately\n     let go of her hand. Latika stumbles.\n\n                                LATIKA\n                  Jamal!\n\n     Jamal scrambles to the rail. The train gains more\n     speed. Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump,\n     but Salim flings him backward. Jamal tries to scramble\n     to his feet again, but Salim restrains him.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Got to go back. We've got to go\n                  back.\n\n                                SALIM\n                  He'll kill us if we go back.\n                  Jamal! He was going to take your\n                  eyes out- with a bloody spoon!\n\n     The train is speeding along. Jamal breaks free and\n     stares back at Latika.\n\n                                SALIM (CONT'D)\n                  She'll be alright. She always\n                  is.\n\n     Latika stumbles again and stops running. They watch as\n     Punnoose catches up with her and stops running. He\n     smashes Latika to the ground.\n\n\n69   INT. STUDIO.

MORNING.                                      71\n\n     Salim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal\n     is staring blankly down the track.\n\n                                  SALIM\n                  Ar\u00e9, Jamal...\n\n     Salim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder.

MORNING.                  72\n\n     The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A\n     middle class Indian couple with their three children\n     are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before\n     them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes\n     Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is\n     clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train\n     roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim\n     who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open\n     window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be\n     hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.\n\n     Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children\n     spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,\n     she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand\n     which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,\n     Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding\n     onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.\n     Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles\n     and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and\n     tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.\n     Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are\n     images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-\n\n     - huddled together against the freezing rain...\n\n     - surfing the wind at the front of the train...\n\n     - admiring the distant Himalaya....\n\n                             JAMAL V/O\n               We criss-crossed the country\n               from Rajasthan to Calcutta.\n               Every time we were thrown off we\n               got back on again. This was our\n               home for years. A home with\n               wheels and a whistle.\n\n     The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.\n\n\n73   EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY.                             73\n\n     Groggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the\n     tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.\n     And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze\n     of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the\n     distance- something impossibly beautiful.\n\n                             JAMAL\n               Salim? Is this heaven?\n\n                             SALIM\n               You're not dead, Jamal.\n\n     Jamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up\n     from the ground. But the apparition is still there.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         46.\n73   CONTINUED:                                                73\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  So what's that?\n\n                                SALIM\n                  Wow.\n\n     They stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline\n     of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the\n     morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                  Some hotel, huh?\n\n\n74   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY.                                      74\n\n     Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj\n     Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive\n     monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment\n     for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists\n     flowing behind him.\n\n                                GUIDE\n                  ...there are five main elements\n                  to the Taj.

If\n                  you would like to follow me, I\n                  will show you the ninety-nine\n                  names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb.\n                  As before, please remove your\n                  shoes.\n\n     Jamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the\n     mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of\n     shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes,\n     before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A\n     smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows\n     and he saunters away, all mock-innocence.\n\n\n75   EXT. TAJ MAHAL.

DAY.                               96\n\n     Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He\n     moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then\n     he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked.\n     It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not\n     even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple\n     of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He\n     turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up\n     against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older\n     now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye-\n     less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits\n     until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless\n     sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He\n     turns and bows low, putting his hands together.\n\n                                ARVIND\n                  Namaste, Sahib.

They are\n     garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to\n     60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,\n     exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on\n     the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway\n     after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait\n     for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of\n     women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them\n     something, as the women either shrug or offer them\n     something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.\n     But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the\n     street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from\n     the group.\n\n\n98   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                        98\n\n     They go into one of the tiny houses.

They move on, past\n      more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,\n      not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They\n      reach the end of the landing. From the other side of\n      the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to\n      one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can\n      see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;\n      though not the rag-picker of before.

In the half light, her hands begin to move for\n      Jamal, the elegant, alluring hand movements of the bar-\n      girl dancers. Jamal stares, mesmerised.\n\n                                 LATIKA\n                   You came back for me.\n\n                                   JAMAL\n                   Of course.\n\n                                 LATIKA\n                   I thought you'd forgotten.\n\n                                 AMIR\n                   I never forgot.

The two brothers go down fighting, but of\n      course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches\n      herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost\n      delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the\n      door, laughing.\n\n\n108   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR.

You have five seconds.\n                   One, two, three, four-\n\n      Salim cocks the pistol. Jamal screws up his eyes for\n      the inevitable. But Salim shoves him out with a roar\n      and slams the door. Jamal bangs on the door.\n\n                                 JAMAL O/S\n                   Salim...\n\n      Salim walks slowly back down the corridor as Jamal\n      bangs and bangs on the door.

Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar\n       Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them.\n       All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a\n       Millionaire on the front page.\n\n                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE\n                    And if that isn't enough for\n                    you...\n\n       He motions the Inspector to come over to the window.\n\n       Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks\n       alarmed.\n\n                                   INSPECTOR\n                    That's-?\n\n                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE\n                    - yes, yes!

The Commissioner has been staring out of the\n       window at the crowds. Turns back to them.\n\n                                  COMMISIONER OF POLICE\n                    He's in for fraud, so you charge\n                    him for fraud. Fast.

JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.            157\n\n       A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling\n       back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on\n       the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing\n       cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls\n       giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring\n       drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at\n       the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip\n       from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is\n       staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the\n       remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a\n       music channel. Latika hurries out.\n\n                               JAVED\n                 What about my bloody whisky,\n                 woman?\n\n       But she has already gone.

Javed's mobile\n       rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a\n       bottle to the back.\n\n                               SALIM\n                 We're out. I'll just get- Syed.\n\n       Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries\n       out.\n\n\n158    INT . JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. NIGHT.           158\n\n       A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone-\n       the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares\n       at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and\n       phone.\n\n                               SALIM\n                      (to himself)\n                 Final answer?\n\n       He finds this faintly amusing.\n\n                                                        109.\n\n\n159   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                 159\n\n      Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears\n      running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front\n      of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away\n      the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door\n      behind him. Stares at the tv.\n\n                              SALIM\n                That boy. He will never give up.\n                Never.\n\n      He shakes his head.\n\n                                 SALIM (CONT'D)\n                Crazy chutiy\u00e9.\n\n      Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks\n      towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.\n\n                                 SALIM (CONT'D)\n                Ja.

Hesitates.\n\n                              LATIKA\n                He'll kill you.\n\n      Salim smiles, shakes his head.\n\n                              SALIM\n                It is not written.\n\n                                 JAVED O/S\n                Salim!\n\n      Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for\n      her.\n\n                              LATIKA\n                Salim, I....can't.\n\n      Salim points at the television.\n\n                              SALIM\n                You have to. It'll take you two\n                hours if you drive fast.

Salim takes hold of both sides of her\n      head for a moment.\n\n                                 SALIM (CONT'D)\n                   For what I have done, please\n                   forgive me.\n\n      Salim releases her.\n\n                                 SALIM (CONT'D)\n                   Go.

The Inspector appears\n      next to them.\n\n                              INSPECTOR\n                Just one more thing left, Sir.\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               120.\n193   CONTINUED:                                                   193\n\n      Prem smiles.\n\n                                   PREM\n                   Finally, huh?\n\n                                 INSPECTOR\n                   If you'd like to come with me.\n\n      He takes Jamal by the arm, leads him backstage.\n\n\n\n194   INT/EXT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                 194\n\n      Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the\n      Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:\n\n                                 JAMAL\n                   Truth alone triumphs? I should\n                   have known better.\n\n      The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.\n      Holds the back door open for Jamal.\n\n                                 INSPECTOR\n                   Thought you might need a lift,\n                   Sir.\n\n      He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets\n      out.\n\n\n195   EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    195\n\n      Jamal finds himself    gazing up     at VT station. Slowly, he\n      wanders inside. The    Inspector     takes the contents of the\n      file and tears them    slowly in     half. Lets the pieces\n      fall on the ground.    Gets back     in the jeep and drives\n      away.\n\n\n196   OMITTED                                                      196\n\n\n197   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    197\n\n      VT station is awash with the evening commute. Thousands\n      of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still\n      figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of\n      Frederick Stevens. Jamal. Then there is a gap in the\n      wall of bodies that swirls around him. Jamal gets to\n      his feet.\n\n                                   JAMAL\n                   Latika?\n\n      Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        121.\n197   CONTINUED:                                            197\n\n                                 LATIKA\n                   Jamal?\n\n      Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will\n      stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they\n      are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold\n      each other's hands tight. The whole station seems\n      frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being\n      Jamal and Latika.\n\n                                  LATIKA (CONT'D)\n                   I thought we would meet again\n                   only in death.\n\n      He shakes his head.\n\n                                 JAMAL\n                   I knew you'd be watching.\n\n      Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head\n      gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife\n      scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to\n      turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand\n      slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.\n\n                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                   This is our destiny.\n\n      He gently kisses the scarred cheek.\n\n                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)\n                   This is our destiny.\n\n      The camera pulls back and back, rising above the\n      station. The music starts and the frozen station comes\n      alive, two thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women\n      dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound\n      celebration of hope and humanity that has at its\n      centre, Jamal and Latika.\n\n\n\n                                                      THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nSlumdog Millionaire\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Simon Beaufoy\u00a0\u00a0Vikas Swarup\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:35:53.030149"}
