DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN\n</b>\n      Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN\n\n      We're looking down at what used to be called \"The End of the Known\n      World.\" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.\n\n      In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.\n\n      Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging\n      over a cliff:\n\n      AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.\n\n      Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up\n      the ice. A human figure. This is:\n\n<b>      JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.\n</b>\n      Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has\n      an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black\n      backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to\n      JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -\n\n      CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks\n      below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He\n      looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 There has to be an easier way to earn\n                 a living.\n\n      Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -\n\n<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE -\n</b>\n      He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a\n      toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -\n\n<b>      THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -\n</b>\n<b>      BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -\n</b>\n      And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of\n      water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached\n      to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.\n\n      Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and\n      forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.\n\n      At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other\n      pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:\n\n<b>      THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -\n</b>\n      Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON BOND -\n</b>\n      Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on\n      the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.\n\n<b>      ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -\n</b>\n      Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally\n      frayed through.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON BOND -\n</b>\n      One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls\n      himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE\n      ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,\n      he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely\n      holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.\n\n<b>      EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -\n</b>\n      Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -\n      through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.\n\n      As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he\n      smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -\n\n<b>      THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -\n</b>\n      Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.\n\n<b>      IN THE WATERBED -\n</b>\n      A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,\n      he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.\n\n<b>      NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)\n</b>\n      Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:\n\n<b>      BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -\n</b>\n      On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled\n      down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.\n      In other words: This was the only way in.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON BOND -\n</b>\n      007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK\n      CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the\n      side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.\n\n      He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond\n      slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.\n\n<b>      EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -\n</b>\n<b>      EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -\n</b>\n      Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,\n      amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.\n\n<b>      EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -\n</b>\n      Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the\n      bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:\n\n<b>      A ROCK OUTCROPPING.\n</b>\n      Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He\n      unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a\n      HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:\n\n<b>      A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)\n</b>\n      50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen\n      MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the\n      ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying\n      HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.\n\n      Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with\n      INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.\n\n<b>      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -\n</b>\n      Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.\n\n<b>      THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -\n</b>\n      He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining\n      over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.\n\n<b>      THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.\n</b>\n<b>                              BOND'S VOICE\n</b>                       (over a speaker)\n                 Seven, in position.\n\n<b>                              TANNER'S VOICE\n</b>                 Roger, Seven.\n\n      Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,\n      including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,\n      an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.\n\n      M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:\n\n<b>                              M\n</b>                 ...

At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -\n\n      THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.\n\n      BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing\n      up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -\n      completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.\n\n      BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,\n      dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.\n\n      STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -\n\n      And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES\n      PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper &amp; Co.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                       (to himself, flexing the cape)\n                 So that's how he does it.\n\n      Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.\n\n      Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but\n      Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.\n\n<b>      RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT\n</b>\n      As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:\n\n      THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing\n      carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -\n\n      But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes\n      right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,\n      pulling the men down, after him.\n\n<b>      BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n      Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:\n\n      A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -\n\n      and just beyond this -\n\n      A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.\n\n      BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the\n      picture for him.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 Prego, prego.

And with perfect timing,\n      Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face\n      just as he comes around the corner.\n\n      Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 Grazie -\n\n      And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the\n      thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.\n\n      The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart\n      stops on top of him, pinning him down.\n\n      BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.\n\n      Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS\n      in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed\n      off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -\n\n      007 disappears down the sidestreet.\n\n      Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO\n      MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of\n      the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT\n<b>      INTO THE CANAL.\n</b>\n<b>      RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -\n</b>\n      Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug\n      #1 disappear onto the side Street.\n\n      Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course\n      along the canals toward -\n\n<b>      THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT\n</b>\n      Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street.

Bond watches as they split up and\n      start looking for him.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -\n</b>\n      Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:\n\n      THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast\n      move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing\n      it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from\n      under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.\n      (He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)\n\n<b>      NEW ANGLE -\n</b>\n      Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the\n      courtyard of Il Bovolo.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -\n</b>\n      Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he\n      pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the\n      cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -\n\n      The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,\n      hurling him against the opposite wall.\n\n      With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.\n\n<b>                              THUG #2\n</b>                 Marco - I didn't know -\n\n<b>                              THUG #1\n</b>                 After him!\n\n      They charge off.\n\n<b>      IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n      Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No\n      way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH\n      FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.\n\n<b>      THE SPIRAL STAIRS -\n</b>\n      Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.\n\n<b>      RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -\n</b>\n      The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR\n      BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.\n\n<b>      THE BALCONY -\n</b>\n      Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the\n      building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the\n      courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.\n\n      Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.\n\n      Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the\n      GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and\n      disappears from sight...\n\n      Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.\n\n<b>      FIRST ROOFTOP -\n</b>\n      Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are\n      SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop\n      to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.\n\n<b>      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -\n</b>\n      007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold\n      on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:\n      The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.\n\n      As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -\n\n<b>      RETURN ON THE BALCONY -\n</b>\n      Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy\n      to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.\n\n<b>      FIRST ROOFTOP -\n</b>\n      Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the\n      next building. He makes a running leap.\n\n<b>      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -\n</b>\n      Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They\n      grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the\n      roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.\n\n      AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the\n      skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.\n\n      007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1\n      tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO\n<b>      BOND'S LEGS.\n</b>\n      They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the\n      two of them fall -\n\n<b>      CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -\n</b>\n<b>      VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.\n</b>\n      They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the\n      Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the\n      collar, hauling him up on his feet.\n\n      Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up\n      on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:\n\n<b>                              THUG #1\n</b>                 I owe you some pain.\n\n      With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his\n      gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just\n      clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.\n\n      The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,\n      and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.\n\n      As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally\n      (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.\n\n      With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.\n      He's having fun.\n\n<b>      AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -\n</b>\n      THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.\n\n      BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out\n      of the way, like a gnat.\n\n      Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from\n      the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.\n\n      Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,\n      and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed \"King Arthur\" type sword.\n\n      With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.\n      The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:\n\n<b>      A DISPLAY WALL -\n</b>\n      filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.\n      (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.\n      Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.\n\n      THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug\n      #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.\n\n<b>      NEW ANGLE -\n</b>\n      Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond\n      backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.\n      (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)\n\n      Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the\n      last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from\n      killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.\n\n      As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A\n      studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)\n\n      Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN\n      TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.\n\n      Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the\n      wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM\n      THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -\n\n      In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1\n      backwards, down onto the floor.\n\n<b>      AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -\n</b>\n<b>      THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.\n</b>\n<b>      BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL.

And in the middle of the room -\n\n<b>      THE RED BOX.\n</b>\n      Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard\n      through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking\n      for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:\n\n      URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.\n\n      BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY\n      Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on\n      a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.\n\n      Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -\n      examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -\n\n      And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.\n      (They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside\n      another )\n\n      Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it\n      is used for. Just then -\n\n      THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the\n      cutting saw, moves to the first door -\n\n      And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the\n      CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.\n\n<b>      BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -\n</b>\n      YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks\n      around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not\n      the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:\n\n      THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.\n\n      Yung picks up a telephone.\n\n<b>      SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -\n</b>\n      Bond emerges from the bulkhead door.

Bond tries to block the\n      descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.\n\n      Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing\n      each other against the side of the press...\n\n      Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and\n      pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,\n      Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -\n\n      And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops\n      him on the head with the crowbar.\n\n      Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -\n\n      But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out\n      from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.\n\n      Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard\n      as he comes to finish Bond off.\n\n      The Guard stumbles backward -\n\n      Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that\n      wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)\n\n      Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the\n      BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that\n      as Bond turns -\n\n      The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.\n      Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond\n      ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -\n\n      Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,\n      pulling Sidney away at the last moment.\n\n      The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...\n\n      The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 He was bad news.\n\n      Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney\n      and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 Down there!\n\n      They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:\n\n<b>      INT.

He\n      frantically tries to break free for the surface -\n\n      But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on\n      Harmsway's shoulders.\n\n      Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at\n      Bond in a haze of bubbles...\n\n      Then falls still.\n\n      With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -\n\n<b>      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -\n</b>\n      through the bridge windows, up to -\n\n<b>      THE SURFACE.\n</b>\n      He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost\n      instantly, dives down again.\n\n<b>      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -\n</b>\n      Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could\n      just grab it, and stop it from sinking.\n\n      He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,\n      just beyond his reach.\n\n      And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his\n      breath a second longer -\n\n      A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.\n\n      Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She\n      puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...\n\n      And they share the air as they rise from the depths.\n\n<b>      THE SURFACE -\n</b>\n      They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:\n\n<b>                              SIDNEY\n</b>                 What do you mean, you'd rather die\n                 alone?\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 I didn't say when I want to die -\n\n      She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'\n      dinghy floating nearby.\n\n<b>      NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -\n</b>\n      Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the\n      bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.\n\n      After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 ... Yes???\n\n<b>                              SIDNEY\n</b>                 Before we go any further here, Mr.\n                 Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just\n                 want to get two things straight.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 ...

I'm claiming it for salvage.\n                 One-third of that gold is mine.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 And number two?\n\n<b>                              SIDNEY\n</b>                 If you think we're going to have some\n                 kind of 'life affirming' romance here\n                 just because we cheated death, let me\n                 be clear:\n                       (pause)\n                 We're going to have it where I want,\n                 and when I want.\n\n<b>                              BOND\n</b>                 And when might that be?\n\n<b>                              SIDNEY\n</b>                 Now.\n\n      He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:\n\n<b>      TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -\n</b>\n      With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both\n      lowered, revealing Q and Wade.\n\n<b>                              Q\n</b>                 ...
