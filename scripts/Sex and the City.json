I made a little decision\n               that I hope you'll be happy about.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               Oh, honey... you finally got Botox.\n\n                         CARRIE\n               No. I did not get Botox\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll\n               love it.\n\n                         CARRIE\n               I did not call to talk about Botox.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               I'm just saying.\n\n     Samantha reaches the top of the stairs. Blow-ups of Smith on\n     various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small\n     office space.\n\n                         CARRIE\n               So... Last week, after the auction,\n               I started thinking about my\n               options.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               Right.\n\n                         CARRIE\n               Right, and... well, Big and I\n               decided to get married.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               Really?\n\n                         CARRIE\n               Yes.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               That's great.\n\n                                                   19.\n\n\n                         CARRIE\n               You sounded more excited about the\n               botox.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               Well, honey -- I am excited for you\n               but -- you know me... I don't\n               really believe in marriage....\n               Botox on the other hand -- That\n               works every time.\n\n     A RECEPTIONIST (23) hands her some messages.\n\n                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\n               Honey, I've got to go. The People\n               magazine person is on hold.

Carrie looks at her phone: dismissed and\n     disappointed. She closes it and walks on.\n\n\n25   INT. FENDI -- A LITTLE LATER                               25\n\n     Carrie rounds a corner. Her phone rings.\n\n                            CARRIE\n               Hello?\n\n\n26   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- CONTINUOUS               26\n\n     Intercut with Samantha standing in her office.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               I think I was in shock. I mean,\n               it's you getting married. This is\n               not some random person -- it's you.\n\n                            CARRIE\n               I hear ya.\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               And I guess, I thought that after\n               that big mess with Aidan -- you'd\n               never want to get married.\n\n                            CARRIE\n               I know.\n\n                                           19A.\n\n\n                  SAMANTHA\n        So, I put you in my \"we're never\n        getting married\" file. Now, I've\n        got to take you out of that file.\n\n                  CARRIE\n        Sorry about the extra paper work.\n\n                  SAMANTHA\n        You'll get my bill.\n\n                  CARRIE\n        Samantha, it feels so different\n        this time. No clich\u00e9 romantic\n        kneeling down on one knee. Just you\n        know, two grown-ups -- making a\n        decision about spending their lives\n        together.\n\n                                                   20.\n\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               Well, I'm happy for you.\n\n                         CARRIE\n               And one more thing... I want you to\n               be maid of honor. How do you feel\n               about that?\n\n                         SAMANTHA\n               The same way you feel about Botox.\n               Painful and unnecessary.\n\n     Carrie laughs. Samantha shrugs.\n\n\n27   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                   27\n\n     Carrie and Charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of\n     names. ANTHONY sits at her makeup vanity. He has a large\n     notebook open in front of him.\n\n                         CHARLOTTE\n               74, 75, 76.... Seventy-six guests.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n               Seventy five sounds better. \"A\n               small, wedding of seventy five\n               guests.\"\n\n     Carrie looks at the list.\n\n                         CARRIE (V.O.)\n               As a wedding gift, Charlotte had\n               given me Anthony Marantino --\n               friend and wedding planner.\n\n     Carrie crosses someone off. Charlotte reacts, shocked.\n\n                         CARRIE (CONT'D)\n               What? She was borderline anyway.\n\n                                              21.\n\n\n                    ANTHONY\n          Cut throat -- I love it. I hope\n          you're that decisive when it comes\n          to the location and the dress.\n\n                    CARRIE\n          Oh. I found the dress.\n\n                    CHARLOTTE\n          What?! When?\n\n                    CARRIE\n          The other day. I have it here.\n\nCarrie gets up and goes into the closet. Anthony hurries over\nand sits next to Charlotte.\n\n                    ANTHONY\n          This is going to be good!\n\n                    CHARLOTTE\n          I'm so excited!\n\n                    CARRIE (V.O.)\n          Here it is.\n\nAnthony and Charlotte grab hands in anticipation as Carrie\ncomes out of her closet. She holds up a simple OFF-WHITE\nVINTAGE SUIT. Charlotte and Anthony deflate.\n\n                    CARRIE (CONT'D)\n          Well... that was the exact reaction\n          I was aiming for.\n\n                    CHARLOTTE\n          No, it's pretty but it's so --\n          simple.\n\n                    CARRIE\n          Simple and classic. When I saw it I\n          just thought: That is what I should\n          marry Big in.\n\n                    ANTHONY\n          Well, who's it by? The label?\n\n                    CARRIE\n          No one. I found it in a vintage\n          shop.\n\n                    ANTHONY\n          \"The bride wore a dress by no one.\"\n\n                                                   22.\n\n\n     She turns and heads back into the closet.\n\n                         CARRIE\n                   (As she goes)\n               Don't worry, I'll style it up with\n               shoes.\n\n     Anthony turns to Charlotte and says in a low voice.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n               The invitation is fancier than the\n               dress.\n\n                         CARRIE (O.C.)\n               I heard that.\n\n\n28   INT. BROOKLYN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                  28\n\n     A \"family style\" Italian restaurant. Miranda, in business\n     clothes, sits with Steve, Brady and MAGDA. Brady's face is\n     covered in spaghetti sauce.\n\n                         CARRIE (V.O.)\n               And from Anthony Marantino to\n               spaghetti marinara.\n\n                         MIRANDA\n               Where is he with the check?\n\n                         STEVE\n               Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's\n               not even finished yet.\n\n                         MIRANDA\n               I still have a legal brief to work\n               on when I get home.\n\n                         BRADY\n               I have to go to the bathroom.\n\n                         MAGDA\n               I'll take him. Wash that beautiful\n               face too, yes?\n\n     Brady nods. Magda walks away with Brady. Miranda is packing\n     up Brady's action figures. Steve gives her a look.\n\n                         MIRANDA\n               What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.\n               Brady woke me up at five AM.\n\n                                                     23.\n\n\n                         STEVE\n               He woke me up too.\n\n     Silence. She sips her cappuccino. Foam covers her top lip. He\n     looks over at her and smiles.\n\n                         STEVE (CONT'D)\n               You got milk on your top lip.\n\n     She licks it off, not pleased.\n\n                           STEVE (CONT'D)\n               What now?\n\n                         MIRANDA\n               It's like you're always criticizing\n               me.\n\n                          STEVE\n               I am not.\n                    (Beat; then, cute)\n               You want to go through life with\n               foam on your lip and no one telling\n               you?\n\n     Silence. He reaches down and picks up her coffee cup and\n     sips... putting lots of foam on his lip. He looks over.\n\n                         STEVE (CONT'D)\n               Anything you want to tell me?\n\n     She shakes her head: No. He puts his face in front of hers.\n     She laughs. He licks his lip.\n\n\n29   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S BEDROOM -- LATER                    29\n\n     Steve is in bed with Miranda, they are making love.

He moves to his side of the bed.\n\n                         STEVE (CONT'D)\n                   (As he turns away)\n               There was snow on the ground.\n\n     He gets out of the bed and walks away.

BEACH -- A LITTLE LATER                               204A\n\n       Samantha walks on the beach. The dog is walking with her.\n\n                                            125A.\n\n\n                    CARRIE (V.O.)\n          ... Samantha had money, a career\n          and a man who loved her... Still,\n          she couldn't shake the feeling that\n          something was missing from her\n          life.\n\nThe dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck.\n\n                                                     126.\n\n\n                          SAMANTHA\n                No!

Water runs over his NAKED\n      and PERFECT BODY. He sees her and smiles a hot smile. She is\n      thrown -- overwhelmed.\n\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\n                Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my\n                dog ran up on your dick--\n                    (catching herself)\n                --Deck!\n\n      There is a GROWL sound. She looks -- the dog is humping a\n      towel on the deck floor. She looks back at Dante.\n\n                          DANTE\n                Want to join me?\n\n      Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the\n      dog and hurries away. He calls after her.\n\n                             DANTE (CONT'D)\n                I'm Dante.     Stop by -- anytime.\n\n      Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way.\n\n\n206   EXT.

He unzips\n      it while looking at Samantha. SAMANTHA dips a chip in\n      guacamole and eats it. He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles\n      at her. She dips another chip. He steps out of it and looks\n      at her -- almost torturing her. She looks the other way, dips\n      another chip in guacamole and eats it. Then another.\n\n                                                   127.\n\n\n207   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- DAY -- SPRING                     207\n\n      Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone. She picks up a slice\n      of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table.\n\n                           SAMANTHA\n                We agreed that no one else from the\n                show but Smith was going to be on\n                the cover.\n\n      She walks to the window and looks out. Dante is on his deck\n      putting on sun screen. He glistens. She chews.\n\n\n208   INT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- NIGHT -- SPRING                      208\n\n      Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who\n      is on his deck smoking a joint. He indicates for her to come\n      over. She shakes her head: No. He walks away. She presses a\n      button on the control panel. The jacuzzi jets start. She re-\n      positions herself \"on\" them, then... She reaches over and\n      grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and... starts eating it.\n\n\n209   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            209\n\n      Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone. On\n      the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS.\n\n                          CARRIE (V.O.)\n                With her two weeks just about up,\n                Miranda's list of pros and cons\n                were equal.\n\n      She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip\n      on her cappuccino. As she stands up, she catches sight of\n      herself in the mirrored wall. Cappuccino foam covers her top\n      lip. She remembers. She knows.\n\n\n210   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- LATER THAT DAY                      210\n\n      Miranda stands on the bridge. Alone. She looks at her watch.\n\n                          CARRIE (V.O.)\n                It suddenly dawned on Miranda that\n                Steve's list might have had more\n                cons then pros.\n\n      Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is\n      seen RUNNING up the bridge... towards her.\n\n                                                  127A.\n\n\n211   EXT.

CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                    213\n\n      Carrie's apartment is transformed. It is sleeker, polished,\n      more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel.\n\n                          CARRIE (V.O.)\n                And at home -- everything felt and\n                looked different -- and yet still\n                very much me.\n\n      Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with\n      Lilacs in a large vase. The door bell buzzes.\n\n\n214   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          214\n\n      Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with a very\n      pregnant Charlotte.\n\n                          CARRIE\n                Sorry.

CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  215\n\n      WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun. The front door is open\n      and a coat rack is visible in the hall. A couple of WAITERS\n      (20's) move around. ANTHONY comes up to Carrie.\n\n                                             129.\n\n\n                    ANTHONY\n          A woman just put a glass down on\n          your new desk without a coaster.

Her plane landed\n          two hours ago.\n\n                    CARRIE\n          You know her, probably ran to the\n          hotel gym for a quick work-out.\n\nSamantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the\ndog is in her purse.\n\n                    SAMANTHA\n          There's no place like home.\n\n                      CARRIE\n          Sweetie!\n\nThey kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss.\n\n                    MIRANDA\n          There's a rat in your purse.\n\n                    CARRIE\n          And that rat better be house\n          trained.\n\nA CATER WAITER walks over to her.\n\n                    CATER WAITER\n          Can I take your coat?\n\nSamantha nods and takes off her coat. Revealing: She has a\nbelly. A very non-Samantha big fat gut.\n\nCarrie looks at it. Miranda looks at it. Carrie and Miranda\nexchange looks. Charlotte comes running down the hall.\n\n                      CHARLOTTE\n          Samantha!\n\nSamantha raises her arms to greet her. Her blouse rides up,\nthe gut peeks out.

Her eyes WIDEN. Big is sitting across the room at a\n      table -- alone. He hasn't seen her.

DINERS looks. Big spots her -- their eyes meet.\n      She moves away as quickly as she can through the room. He\n      gets up and follows after her.\n\n\n224   EXT.
