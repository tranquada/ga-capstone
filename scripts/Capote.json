A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN \n               (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.\n\n               CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman \n               and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the \n               driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT.\n\n               EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING\n\n               A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many \n               are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some \n               look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         Hello.\n\n               Kids back away.

Our lead story:\n\n               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.\n\n               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front \n               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. \n               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the \n               headline in the Kansas City Star: \"Police Fear Lynch Mob.\" \n               The CAR RADIO is on.\n\n                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n                         ...newsmen from six states have joined \n                         scores of Kansans as they await the \n                         arrival of confessed killers Perry \n                         Smith and Richard Hickock.

Old ladies; \n               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists \n               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom \n               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as \n               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a \n               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in \n               an overcoat CRYING silently.\n\n               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together \n               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the \n               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --\n\n                                     NELLE\n                         Hey.\n\n               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A \n               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to \n               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the \n               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens \n               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers \n               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and \n               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.\n\n               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. \n               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, \n               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American \n               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As \n               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as \n               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.\n\n                                     MARIE\n                              (whispers to Truman)\n                         Motorcycle accident.

Perry seems terrified of \n               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. \n               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look \n               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the \n               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - \n               MORNING\n\n               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and \n               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says \"SHERIFF'S \n               RESIDENCE - PRIVATE\".

SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; \n               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- \n               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. \n               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the \n               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)\n\n               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his \n               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. \n               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely \n               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several \n               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:\n\n                                     DOROTHY\n                         Oh. Truman.

Perry and Dick sit at the \n               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their \n               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).\n\n               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at \n               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece \n               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a \n               LARGE PARROT.

They are led away in handcuffs. \n               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- \n               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers.

An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the \n               floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\n               Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small \n               WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.\n\n               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\n               Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for \n               her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing \n               a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He \n               sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY\n\n               Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He \n               has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside \n               the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman \n               takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                              (to Perry)\n                         I don't care what your plans are for \n                         yourself...\n\n               He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic \n               BABY SPOON from the basket.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         But you're gonna wake up enough to \n                         tell me what you did with my tie.\n\n               He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. \n               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         It's okay. It's Truman.

Truman stands against the wall watching him. \n               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's \n               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY \n               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, \n               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. \n               Truman touches it.\n\n               INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)\n\n               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. \n               Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.\n\n               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)\n\n               Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of \n               water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         How'd you learn to draw like that?\n\n               Perry closes his eyes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING\n\n               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, \n               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. \n               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a \n               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.\n\n                                     PERRY\n                         Before she had us.

I was abandoned repeatedly as \n                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to \n                         some new town so she could take up \n                         with another man she'd met. Night \n                         after night she'd lock me in the \n                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch \n                         and tell the staff not to let me out \n                         no matter what.

Perry \n               chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.\n\n               Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the \n               crowd, at Truman.\n\n                                     CHAPLAIN\n                         Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort \n                         me.\n\n               The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He \n               stands next to Alvin Dewey.\n\n                                     CHAPLAIN\n                         Thou preparest a table before me in \n                         the presence of mine enemies. Thou \n                         annointest my head with oil.\n\n               The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.\n\n                                     CHAPLAIN\n                         My cup runneth over.\n\n               On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse: \n               twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT.\n\n               OVER BLACK:\n\n               The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the \n               receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP, \n               then, after a moment, a VOICE:\n\n                                     NELLE\n                         Hello.\n\n               FADE UP:\n\n               INT.

After a \n               long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE \n               wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.\n\n                                     SHAWN\n                         It came to the hotel this morning. I \n                         told them I'd give it to you.\n\n               The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed \n               to Truman. Truman opens it.\n\n               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL \n               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds \n               Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:\n\n                                     PERRY (V.O.)\n                         Did we not know we were to die, we \n                         would be children. By knowing it, we \n                         are given the opportunity to mature \n                         in spirit...\n\n               Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.\n\n               We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a \n               SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing \n               in the puddle.\n\n                                     PERRY (V.O.)\n                         Some take that opportunity. I hope I \n                         have...\n\n               Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's \n               very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.\n\n                                     PERRY\n                         Life is only the father of wisdom. \n                         Death is the mother.\n\n               Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes \n               it out, clutches it.\n\n               Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on \n               tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.\n\n               The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the \n               tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.\n\n                                                             FADE TO BLACK.\n\n               TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)\n\n               In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in \n               America.\n\n               He never finished another book.\n\n               The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads: \n               \"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered \n               ones. \"\n\n               He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.\n\n  \n\n                                        THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nCapote\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Dan Futterman\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:03.154082"}
