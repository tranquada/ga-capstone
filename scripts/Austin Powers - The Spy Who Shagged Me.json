EVIL\n</b>                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine \n                         just goes on a little longer than it \n                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, \n                         perform fellatio once and you're a \n                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. \n                         I remember once I was being fisted \n                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where \n                         the story gets interesting. He was \n                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red \n                         meat all night long, but one sip of \n                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I \n                         remember we were caught in fragrance \n                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you \n                         can imagine my humiliation at having \n                         Hank hear me say, \"Mr. French, no \n                         teeth.\" One of my greatest \n                         disappointments is that I never became \n                         a song and dance man. I could have \n                         been a quadruple threat, kind of \n                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, \n                         singer, actor, and I would possess \n                         nuclear weapons, the latter being \n                         the most threatening of the four. I \n                         once sat on a bus and tried to will \n                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended \n                         up with was a sense of failure and a \n                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth \n                         and perhaps a grudging respect for \n                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. \n                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I \n                         slept in a horse once. It was quite \n                         roomy. On second thought, it was the \n                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' \n                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I \n                         wrote \"It's Raining Men\", or so the \n                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I \n                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy \n                         of The Fonze while I was in coma \n                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer \n                         hash, but who at the end of the day \n                         can honestly say they haven't done \n                         that?\n\n               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once \n               quiet.\n\n<b>                                     KLANSMAN\n</b>                         What are you, some kind of freak?\n\n<b>                                     SCOTT\n</b>                         Shut up, jagoff!\n\n               Studio audience whoops at this.\n\n<b>                                     KLANSMAN\n</b>                         I'll kick your ass punk!\n\n               Crowd goes crazy.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

I am a \n                         spiritual teacher and I have combined \n                         many disparate disciplines into a \n                         unified movement of human potentiality \n                         and equipoise that I learned from my \n                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste \n                         man who died mysteriously of a disease \n                         that strangely had all the hallmarks \n                         of syphilis. He would say to me, \n                         Sparky, love is all, life is breath.\n\n<b>                                     DISCIPLES\n</b>                         Ahhhhhh!\n\n<b>                                     GURU PITKA\n</b>                         Now, perhaps you are wondering where \n                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, \n                         when we were young we used to play a \n                         game called \"Stinkmop\". We would \n                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop \n                         into it, and play tag. I did not \n                         care for \"Stinkmop\" and a very wise \n                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, \n                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name \n                         kind of stuck.\n\n<b>                                     DISCIPLES\n</b>                         Ahhhhhhhh...\n\n<b>                                     GURU PITKA\n</b>                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist \n                         instead of a therapist is that \n                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' \n                         and that will not help us attain \n                         potentiality. Now what is \n                         potentiality? It is the ability to \n                         achieve those goals that we wish to \n                         achieve for ourselves. People often \n                         say to me that they feel \"nowhere\", \n                         and I am going to change that to \n                         \"Now here.\"\n\n               The guru holds up a card which says \"NOWHERE = NOW HERE!\"\n\n<b>                                     DISCIPLES\n</b>                         Ahhhhhhh...\n\n<b>                                     GURU PITKA\n</b>                         And you have many assumptions about \n                         your goals, but when you \"assume\" \n                         You make an \"ass\" out of \"u\" and \n                         \"me\".\n\n               Guru holds up a card which says \"ASSUME = ASS - U - ME.\"\n\n<b>                                     DISCIPLES\n</b>                         Ahhhhhhh....\n\n<b>                                     GURU PITKA\n</b>                         The being, or that which we call \n                         'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It \n                         is not the taughts. It is the Gap \n                         between the tinker and the taughts! \n                         We are not our mind, we are not our \n                         body, we are the Gap!\n\n               Guru holds up a card that says \"NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT \n               THE GAP\" with the familiar Gap font.\n\n<b>                                     DISCIPLES\n</b>                         Ahhhhh...\n\n<b>                                     GURU PITKA\n</b>                              (rapid fire)\n                         The heart of the matter is that you \n                         are the heart of the matter.
