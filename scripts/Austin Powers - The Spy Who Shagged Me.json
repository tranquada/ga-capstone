EVIL\n                         They offered me a free makeover.\n\n                                     JERRY SPRINGER\n                         Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the \n                         fathers here today open up to their \n                         sons, sons to the fathers. Is there \n                         anything you'd like to share?\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         Share?\n\n                                     JERRY SPRINGER\n                         Yes, don't you have any secrets?\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.\n\n               Everyone is a little grossed out.\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine \n                         just goes on a little longer than it \n                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, \n                         perform fellatio once and you're a \n                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. \n                         I remember once I was being fisted \n                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where \n                         the story gets interesting. He was \n                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red \n                         meat all night long, but one sip of \n                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I \n                         remember we were caught in fragrance \n                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you \n                         can imagine my humiliation at having \n                         Hank hear me say, \"Mr. French, no \n                         teeth.\" One of my greatest \n                         disappointments is that I never became \n                         a song and dance man. I could have \n                         been a quadruple threat, kind of \n                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, \n                         singer, actor, and I would possess \n                         nuclear weapons, the latter being \n                         the most threatening of the four. I \n                         once sat on a bus and tried to will \n                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended \n                         up with was a sense of failure and a \n                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth \n                         and perhaps a grudging respect for \n                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. \n                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I \n                         slept in a horse once. It was quite \n                         roomy. On second thought, it was the \n                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' \n                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I \n                         wrote \"It's Raining Men\", or so the \n                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I \n                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy \n                         of The Fonze while I was in coma \n                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer \n                         hash, but who at the end of the day \n                         can honestly say they haven't done \n                         that?\n\n               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once \n               quiet.\n\n                                     KLANSMAN\n                         What are you, some kind of freak?\n\n                                     SCOTT\n                         Shut up, jagoff!\n\n               Studio audience whoops at this.\n\n                                     KLANSMAN\n                         I'll kick your ass punk!\n\n               Crowd goes crazy.\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         No one talks to my boy that way!\n\n               Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.  \n               Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         I'm OK, I'm OK.\n\n               There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking \n               him down.\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new \n                         evil lair.\n\n               EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY\n\n               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the \n               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and \n               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.\n\n               INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM\n\n               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks \n               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, \n               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is \n               a Starbucks.\n\n               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and \n               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW \n               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot \n               coffee products.\n\n                                     NUMBER TWO\n                         Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman \n                         of your organization, I seized upon \n                         the opportunity to invest in a small \n                         Seattle-based coffee company several \n                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-\n                         flung empire with 2000 outlets \n                         worldwide.\n\n                                     DR.

Might \n                         I remind you that I run the show \n                         here?

Well, \n                         when we were young we used to play a \n                         game called \"Stinkmop\". We would \n                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop \n                         into it, and play tag. I did not \n                         care for \"Stinkmop\" and a very wise \n                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, \n                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name \n                         kind of stuck.\n\n                                     DISCIPLES\n                         Ahhhhhhhh...\n\n                                     GURU PITKA\n                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist \n                         instead of a therapist is that \n                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' \n                         and that will not help us attain \n                         potentiality. Now what is \n                         potentiality? It is the ability to \n                         achieve those goals that we wish to \n                         achieve for ourselves.
