To bed\r\n           without supper for you!\r\n          She storms away. JACK lies on his bed bereft. He sees his\r\n          sling on the floor and picks it up cradling it as he closes\r\n          his eyes.\r\n          THE CAMERA travels to a hole in the wall and looks below to\r\n          see five bean stalks already growing and intertwining,\r\n          quickly reaching skyward.\r\n\r\n          EXT. KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          WIDE SHOT. Sitting on a hilltop surrounded by the woods on\r\n          all sides, a magical and ageless castle sits aglow. A huge\r\n          FULL MOON hangs in the sky, but there's already the slither\r\n          of a SHADOW beginning to cross its face.\r\n          We hear MUSIC in the background along with the jovial sounds\r\n          of the ball.\r\n\r\n                          36\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           The first night of the festival ball\r\n           brought Cinderella her wish. The\r\n           Prince danced only with her, `til he\r\n           turned and she had slipped away.\r\n          Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back\r\n          entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.\r\n\r\n          ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STEPS\r\n          She descends a long stretch of ancient stone steps that lead\r\n          to the outside grounds.\r\n\r\n          ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS\r\n          She appears running down a garden path below and into the\r\n          woods. A beat later, CINDERELLA'S PRINCE, dashes out on to a\r\n          drawbridge where he spots CINDERELLA below. He is tall, dark\r\n          and impossibly handsome. His STEWARD and other attendants\r\n          join him.\r\n\r\n                          C'S PRINCE\r\n           I must find that girl!\r\n\r\n          EXT. WOODS - PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The BAKER'S WIFE is trying to find her way back to the\r\n          village, pulling an obstinate MILKY-WHITE on a leash behind\r\n          her. We see a piece of the castle in the distance.\r\n          We TRACK CINDERELLA racing through the brush -- not an easy\r\n          feat in a ball gown and gold slippers. We hear VOICES in the\r\n          distance and the NEIGHING OF HORSES. CINDERELLA stumbles on a\r\n          knoll, loses her footing and rolls over and over to the\r\n          bottom landing with a spectacular THUD just yards from the\r\n\r\n          WIFE.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE\r\n           Are you alright, miss?\r\n\r\n                          CINDERELLA\r\n\r\n                          (STARTLED)\r\n           Yes. I just need to catch my breath.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE\r\n           What a beautiful gown you're wearing.\r\n           Were you at the King's Festival?\r\n          CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue\r\n          on her way.\r\n\r\n                          CINDERELLA\r\n           Yes.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE\r\n           Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are\r\n           you in the woods at this hour?\r\n          We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.\r\n\r\n                          37\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           STEWARD (O.S.)\r\n           This way!\r\n\r\n                          CINDERELLA\r\n           Please. Don't let them know I'm here.\r\n          She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around\r\n          and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black\r\n          stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow.

RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her\r\n          clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she\r\n          approaches the tower with trepidation.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE\r\n           Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down\r\n           to me.\r\n          The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks\r\n          out her head looking downward.

Nothing.\r\n          She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a\r\n          little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair\r\n          and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she\r\n          can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling\r\n          some of the hair from her head.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Cinderella flees the castle.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           As the Baker's Wife bolted from the\r\n           tower, the second night of the\r\n           festival was thrown into chaos when\r\n           Cinderella once again ran from the\r\n           Prince.\r\n          While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's\r\n          tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving\r\n          through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in\r\n          pursuit.\r\n          SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC\r\n          CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through\r\n          wooded path.\r\n          ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit.\r\n          The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the\r\n          ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for\r\n          the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S\r\n          attention.\r\n\r\n           C'S PRINCE (O.S.)\r\n           Over here!\r\n          CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the\r\n          ground. CINDERELLA rushes off.\r\n          The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races\r\n          towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short,\r\n          rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into\r\n          thickets.\r\n\r\n           C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)\r\n           Who is she?

See if\r\n           you can find her.\r\n          The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate\r\n          seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over.\r\n\r\n           C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)\r\n           The woods can be a dangerous place...\r\n          She nods to him, out of her depth.

BEANSTALK & JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          To frantic MUSIC, JACK is making his way down to the bottom\r\n          of the beanstalk with all the speed he can muster. This is\r\n          made more difficult by the GOLDEN HARP which he has slung\r\n          over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           Jack took the little girl's dare and\r\n           before he knew it, found himself\r\n           fleeing from a Giant.\r\n          Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on\r\n          for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing\r\n          down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the\r\n          last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and\r\n          runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree.\r\n          JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet\r\n          and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet\r\n          and look to one another.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE (CONT'D)\r\n           What is happening?\r\n\r\n          EXT.

In pain, she grits her teeth\r\n          in a frozen smile.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the\r\n           Prince's horse, unaware of the blood\r\n           dripping from the slipper.\r\n          As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood\r\n          on his white glove.

She is followed by her MOTHER and\r\n\r\n          SISTER.\r\n\r\n                          65\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          STEPMOTHER\r\n           It's a perfect fit, Your Highness!\r\n          LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly\r\n          faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her\r\n          foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and\r\n          gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.\r\n\r\n                          C'S PRINCE\r\n           Have you no other daughters?\r\n\r\n                          STEPMOTHER\r\n           Only a little stunted kitchen wench,\r\n           which her late father left behind but\r\n           she cannot present herself. She is too\r\n           dirty.\r\n          Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears.\r\n          The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down\r\n          in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.\r\n\r\n                          C'S PRINCE\r\n           I would recognize these beautiful eyes\r\n           anywhere. This is the true bride!\r\n          The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to\r\n          his horse. The two of them ride off.\r\n          FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear\r\n          a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up,\r\n          alarmed.\r\n          BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together,\r\n          dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           As punishment for their cruelty,\r\n           Cinderella's birds swooped down upon\r\n           the Stepsisters... and blinded them.\r\n          The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their\r\n          CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are\r\n          all we see.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Quickly!\r\n          The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair\r\n          from the corn and feeds it to the cow.\r\n          JACK begins milking the cow again.

She begins to shake. Blue smoke\r\n          begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped\r\n          inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek..\r\n          The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine-\r\n          months-full of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n                          BAKER\r\n           That was quick!\r\n          The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area\r\n          until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman\r\n          standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has\r\n          been restored to her former self, and she likes what she\r\n          sees.\r\n          The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN\r\n          THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROAD TO KING'S CASTLE/KING'S CASTLE - A NEW DAY\r\n\r\n          GOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen.\r\n          PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by\r\n          CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor\r\n          to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their\r\n          wedding day.\r\n          MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by\r\n          black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her\r\n          PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY.

The Witch\r\n           succeeded in reversing her mother's\r\n           curse. Cinderella finally stopped\r\n           running from her Prince.\r\n          CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd.\r\n          She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over-\r\n          dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous\r\n          \"fascinator\" hat.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           Jack was reunited with his beloved cow\r\n           and his mother could now dress in the\r\n           best a golden egg could buy.\r\n          Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst\r\n          the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.\r\n\r\n           BAKER (V.O.)\r\n           And the Baker and his Wife were proud\r\n           parents of a strapping baby boy.\r\n          The WIFE shows her the BABY.\r\n\r\n                          WIFE\r\n           (calling to her)\r\n           Thanks for the slipper.\r\n          The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the\r\n          PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met\r\n          by cheers.\r\n          The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple.

She makes it to the top, but\r\n          realizes there is no way down on the other side.\r\n          As the GIANT'S footsteps near, the WIFE is engulfed in\r\n          darkness. Trees begin to fall around her and as the earth\r\n          shakes, she loses her balance and falls backwards with a\r\n          scream.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The BAKER is pacing back and forth. CINDERELLA is tending to\r\n          the BABY.

A tussle\r\n          ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped\r\n          something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF.\r\n\r\n                          BAKER\r\n           (at the top of his\r\n\r\n                          LUNGS)\r\n           Stop!
