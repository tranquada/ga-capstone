Well for one, this    |\n| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |\n| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |\n| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |\n| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |\n| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |\n| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |\n| of equal signs (=).                                               |\n|                                                                   |\n| This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    |\n| any.

No, I see it. It's beautiful.\n\nMARLIN\nSo, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna\nget the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your\nman deliver or did he deliver?\n\n\n                                             1\n\nCORAL\nMy man delivered.\n\nMARLIN\nAnd it wasn't so easy.\n\nCORAL\nBecause a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.\n\nMARLIN\nYou better believe they did--every single one of them.\n\nCORAL\nMm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.\n\nMARLIN\nSo, you do like it, don't you?\n\nCORAL\nNo, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable\nwith the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?\n\nMARLIN\nCoral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,\nlook. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by\ntheir bedroom window.\n\nCORAL\nShhh, you're gonna wake the kids.\n\nMARLIN\nOh, right. Right.\n\nCORAL\nAww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.\n\nMARLIN\nYou wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then\nthis half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.\n\nCORAL\nI like Nemo.\n\nMARLIN\nNemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.\n\nCORAL\nJust think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!\n\nMARLIN\nYeah. What if they don't like me?\n\nCORAL\nMarlin.\n\nMARLIN\nNo, really.\n\nCORAL\nThere's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.\n\nCORAL\nWhat?\n\nMARLIN\nYou remember how we met?\n\nCORAL\nWell, I try not to.\n\nMARLIN\nWell, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'\n\nCORAL\nMarlin!\n\nMARLIN\n\n                                             2\n\n'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.\n\nCORAL\nGet away!\n\nMARLIN\nHere he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?\n\nMARLIN\n[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get\ninside, you, right now.\n\nMARLIN\nNo!\n\nMARLIN\nCoral! Coral?\n\nMARLIN\nCoral? Oh!\n\nMARLIN\nOhh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will\nnever let anything happen to you...Nemo.\n\n======================================================================================\n\nNEMO\nFirst day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!\n\nMARLIN\nI don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.\n\nNEMO\nNot you, dad. Me!\n\nMARLIN\nOkay...huh?\n\nNEMO\nGet up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!\nIt's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!\n\nMARLIN\nAll right, I'm up.\n\nNEMO\nOh boy--whoa!\n\nMARLIN\nNemo!\n\nNEMO\nFirst day of school!\n\nMARLIN\n[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.\nAll right, where's the break? You feel a break?\n\nNEMO\nNo.\n\nMARLIN\nSometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?\n\nNEMO\nNo.\n\nMARLIN\nAre you woozy?\n\nNEMO\nNo.\n\nMARLIN\nHow many stripes do I have?\n\n\n                                             3\n\nNEMO\nI'm fine.\n\nMARLIN\nAnswer the stripe question!\n\nNEMO\nThree.\n\nMARLIN\nNo! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,\nyou're okay. How's the lucky fin?\n\nNEMO\nLucky.\n\nMARLIN\nLet's see.\n\nMARLIN\nAre you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.\nYou can wait 5 or 6 years.\n\nNEMO\nCome on, dad. It's time for school.\n\nMARLIN\nAh-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.\n\nNEMO\nOhh...\n\nMARLIN\nDo you want this anemone to sting you?\n\nNEMO\nYes.\n\nMARLIN\nBrush.\n\nNEMO\nOkay, I'm done.\n\nMARLIN\nYou missed a spot.\n\nNEMO\nWhere?\n\nMARLIN\nThere. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!\n\n======================================================================================\n\nMARLIN\nAll right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get\nsome knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?\n\nNEMO\nIt's not safe.\n\nMARLIN\nThat's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.\nAnd then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,\nif you wanna do it four times--\n\nNEMO\nDad..\n\nMARLIN\nAll right. Come on, boy.\n\nNEMO\nDad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!\n\nMARLIN\n\n                                             4\n\nI highly doubt that.\n\nNEMO\nHave you ever met a shark?\n\nMARLIN\nNo, and I don't plan to.\n\nNEMO\nHow old are sea turtles?\n\nMARLIN\nSea turtles? I don't know.\n\nNEMO\nSandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about\na hundred years old!\n\nMARLIN\nWell, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking\nto the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,\nhold my fin.\n\nNEMO\nDad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?\n\nMARLIN\nHey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.\n\nFISH KIDS\nBye, mom!\n\nFISH MOM\nI'll pick you up after school.\n\nCRAB KID\nCome on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!\n\nMARLIN\nCome on, we'll try over there.\n\nMARLIN\nExcuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?\n\nBOB\nWell, look who's out of the anemone.\n\nMARLIN\nYes. Shocking, I know.\n\nBOB\nMarty, right?\n\nMARLIN\nMarlin.\n\nBOB\nBob.\n\nTED\nTed.\n\nBILL\nBill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.\n\nBOB/TED\nYeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.\n\nMARLIN\nWell, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any\nother fish.\n\nBILL\nAw, come on, clownie.\n\nTED\nYeah, do something funny.\n\n                                             5\n\nBOB\nYeah!\n\nMARLIN\nAll right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he\ndoesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place\nand then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.\nNone of them   were walking, so forget that I--\n\nBOB\nSheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!\n\nKIDS\nWhoa!\n\nMR. JOHANSSEN\nAll right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?\n\nNEMO\nDad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?\n\nMARLIN\nI would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.\n\nMARLIN\nThat's where I would play\n\nPEARL\nWhat's wrong with his fin?\n\nTAD\nHe looks funny!\n\nSHELDON\nOw! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?\n\nBOB\nBe nice. It's his first time at school.\n\nMARLIN\nHe was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.\n\nNEMO\nDad.\n\nPEARL\nSee this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really\ntell.Especially when I twirl them like this.\n\nSHELDON\nI'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]\n\nTAD\nI'm obnoxious.\n\nMR. RAY\n[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the\nopen sea.\n\nKIDS\nMr. Ray!\n\nSHELDON\nCome on, Nemo.\n\nMARLIN\nWhoa, you better stay with me.\n\nMR. RAY\n[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and\nme to see.\n\nMR. RAY\nHuh, I wonder where my class has gone?\n\nKIDS\n\n                                               6\n\nWe're under here!\n\nMR. RAY\nOh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so\nlyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.\n\nNEMO\nDad, you can go now.\n\nMR. RAY\nWell, hello. Who is this?\n\nNEMO\nI'm Nemo.\n\nMR. RAY\nWell, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.\n\nNEMO\nOkay.\n\nMR. RAY\nYou live in what kind of home?\n\nNEMO\nAn anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--\n\nMR. RAY\nOkay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!\n\nMARLIN\nJust so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him\ntake a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.\n\nNEMO\nDad, it's time for you to go now.\n\nMR. RAY\nDon't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.\nAnd remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY\nAw, man!\n\nMR. RAY\n[singing]\n\nMARLIN\nBye, Nemo!\n\nNEMO\nBye, dad!\n\nMARLIN\nBye, son! Be safe.\n\nBOB\nHey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.\n\nMARLIN\nWell, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?\n\nBILL\nYeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.\n\nMARLIN\nThey just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,\ninsane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?\n\nBOB\nHey, Marty. Calm down.\n\nMARLIN\nDon't tell me to be calm, pony boy!\n\nBOB\n'Pony boy'?\n\n                                             7\n\nBILL\nYou know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.\n\nTED\nPity.\n\n======================================================================================\n\nMR. RAY\n[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species\nthat live in thesea.\n\nNEMO\nWhoa.\n\nMR. RAY\n[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,\nbryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come\non, sing with me. Oh...!\n\nMR. RAY\nJust the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food\nwith the rays of the sun...\n\nMR. RAY\nOkay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]\nStromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.\nThere are as many protein pairs contained in this...\n\nTAD\nCome on, let's go.\n\nMR. RAY\nCome on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,\nctenophora, bryozoas, three!\n\nNEMO\nHey guys, wait up! Whoa.\n\nTAD\nCool.\n\nTAD\nSaved your life!\n\nPEARL\nAw, you guys made me ink.\n\nNEMO\nWhat's that?\n\nTAD\nI know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a\nbutt.\n\nNEMO\nWhoa.\n\nPEARL\nWow. That's a pretty big butt.\n\nSHELDON\nOh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!\n\nSHELDON\nOh yeah? Let's see you get closer.\n\nPEARL\nOkay. Beat that.\n\nTAD\nCome on, Nemo. How far can you go?\n\nNEMO\nUh, my dad says it's not safe.\n\n\n                                             8\n\nMARLIN\nNemo, no!\n\nNEMO\nDad?\n\nMARLIN\nYou were about to swim into open water!\n\nNEMO\nNo, I wasn't go out--but dad!\n\nMARLIN\nIt was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--\n\nPEARL\nSir, he wasn't gonna go.\n\nTAD\nYeah, he was too afraid.\n\nNEMO\nNo, I wasn't.\n\nMARLIN\nThis does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out\nthere.\nYou know you can't swim well.\n\nNEMO\nI can swim fine, dad, okay?\n\nMARLIN\nNo, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school\nin a year or two.\n\nNEMO\nNo, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--\n\nMARLIN\nClearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do\nthese\nthings but you just can't, Nemo!\n\nNEMO\nI hate you.\n\nMR. RAY\nThere's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a\nscientist, sir. Is there any problem?\n\nMARLIN\nI'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little\ntoo soon for him to be out here unsupervised.\n\nMR. RAY\nWell, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.\n\nMARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost\nfrom sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--\n\nFISH KID\nOh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!\n\nMARLIN\nNemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get\nyou before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one\nmove, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?\nDon't touch the bo--Nemo!\n\nTAD\n[whispering] He touched the butt.\n\nMARLIN\nYou paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.\nDo you hear me? Big...big--\n\n\n                                             9\n\nNEMO\nAaaah! Daddy! Help me!\n\nMARLIN\nI'm coming, Nemo!\n\nKIDS\nAaaah!\n\nMR. RAY\nGet under me, kids!\n\nNEMO\nAh! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!\n\nMARLIN\nOh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!\n\nDIVER\nWhoa! Hold on.\n\nMARLIN\nOh no. No, no.

Sir, are you okay?\n\nMARLIN\nHe's gone, he's gone..\n\nDORY\nThere, there. It's all right.\n\nMARLIN\nHe's gone.\n\nDORY\nIt'll be okay.\n\nMARLIN\nNo, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.\n\nDORY\nHey, I've seen a boat.\n\nMARLIN\nYou have?\n\nDORY\nIt passed by not too long ago.\n\nMARLIN\nA white one?\n\nDORY\nHi. I'm Dory.\n\nMARLIN\nWhere!? Which way!?\n\nDORY\nOh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!\n\nMARLIN\n\n                                             10\n\nThank you! Thank you, thank you so much!\n\nDORY\nNo problem.\n\nMARLIN\nHey! Wait!\n\nDORY\nWill you quit it?\n\nMARLIN\nWhat?\n\nDORY\nI'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?\n\nMARLIN\nHuh?\n\nDORY\nYou got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,\noooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?\n\nMARLIN\nWait a minute..\n\nDORY\nStop following me, okay!?\n\nMARLIN\nWhat? You're showing me which way the boat went!\n\nDORY\nA boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this\nway. Follow me!\n\nMARLIN\nWait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat\nwas going!\n\nDORY\nI did? Oh dear...\n\nMARLIN\nIf this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!\n\nDORY\nNo, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.\n\nMARLIN\nShort-term memory loss..I don't believe this!\n\nDORY\nNo, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think\nit does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?\n\nMARLIN\nSomething's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]\n\nBRUCE\nHello.\n\nDORY\nWell, hi!\n\nBRUCE\nName's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of\nbites like you doing out so late, eh?\n\nMARLIN\nNothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.\n\nBRUCE\nGreat! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?\n\nDORY\n\n                                             11\n\nYou mean like a party?\n\nBRUCE\nYeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?\n\nDORY\nOoh, I love parties! Parties are fun!\n\nMARLIN\nParties are fun, and it's tempting but--\n\nBRUCE\nOh, come on, I insist.\n\nMARLIN\nO-okay..that's all that matters.\n\nDORY\nHey, look--balloons! It is a party!\n\nBRUCE\nHa ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want\none of them to pop.\n\nBRUCE\nAnchor! Chum!\n\nANCHOR\nThere you are, Bruce, finally!\n\nBRUCE\nWe got company.\n\nANCHOR\nIt's about time, mate.\n\nCHUM\nWe've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!\n\nANCHOR\nWe almost had a feeding frenzy.\n\nCHUM\nCome on, let's get this over with.\n\n======================================================================================\n\nBRUCE\nRight, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..\n\nBRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM\n'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must\nfirst change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.\n\nANCHOR\nExcept stinkin' dolphins.\n\nCHUM\nDolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!\nLet me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'\n\nBRUCE\nRight, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your\nfriends?\n\nANCHOR\nGot mine.\n\nDORY\nHey there!\n\nBRUCE\nHow 'bout you, Chum?\n\nCHUM\nOh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.\n\n\n                                             12\n\nBRUCE\nThat's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself\nto one of my friends.\n\nCHUM\nOh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?\n\nBRUCE\nI'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.\n\nANCHOR/CHUM\nHello, Bruce.\n\nBRUCE\nIt has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and\nmade into soup.\n\nCHUM\nYou're an inspiration to all of us.\n\nANCHOR\nAmen.\n\nBRUCE\nRight, then. Who's next?\n\nDORY\nOoh! Pick me! Pick me!\n\nBRUCE\nYes, the little Sheila down the front.\n\nDORY\nWoo-hoo!\n\nBRUCE\nCome on up here.\n\nDORY\nHi. I'm Dory.\n\nBRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM\nHello, Dory.\n\nDORY\nAnd, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.\n\nCHUM\nHey, that's incredible.\n\nBRUCE\nGood on 'ya, mate!\n\nDORY\nWhew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.\n\nBRUCE\nAll right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?\n\nMARLIN\nMe? I don't have a problem.\n\nBRUCE\nOh. Okay..\n\nBRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM\nDenial.\n\nBRUCE\nJust start with your name.\n\nMARLIN\nOkay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--\n\nCHUM\nA clownfish?

This is gonna be good, I can tell.\n\nMARLIN\nAnd my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been\nso tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when\nhe was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.\nSo we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...\n\nTURTLE KID\nThey couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..\n\nSMALL FISH\n..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!\n\nBIG FISH\nGolly, that's amazing!\n\nSMALL FISH\nAnd then dives thousands of..\n\nLOBSTER\n..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.\nHow's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..\n\nSWORDFISH\n..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.\nAnd then he has to blast his way...\n\nDOLPHIN\nSo, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian\nCurrent.\n\nFEMALE BIRD\nWhich means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..\n\nMALE BIRD 1\n..Harbor in a matter of days.
