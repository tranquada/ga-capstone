Well for one, this    |\n| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |\n| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |\n| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |\n| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |\n| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |\n| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |\n| of equal signs (=).                                               |\n<b>|                                                                   |\n</b>| This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    |\n| any.

A fish can breath out here. Did your\nman deliver or did he deliver?\n\n\n<b>                                             1\n</b><b>\n</b><b>CORAL\n</b>My man delivered.\n\n<b>MARLIN\n</b>And it wasn't so easy.\n\n<b>CORAL\n</b>Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.\n\n<b>MARLIN\n</b>You better believe they did--every single one of them.\n\n<b>CORAL\n</b>Mm-hmm.

We go out and back in.\nAnd then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,\nif you wanna do it four times--\n\n<b>NEMO\n</b>Dad..\n\n<b>MARLIN\n</b>All right.
