As it opens and an \n\tenormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up \n\tagainst the cold -- turning back to call inside to the \n\tunseen love of her long life.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSWEET-FACED WOMAN\n</b>\t\tI'm just going to get some \n\t\tflowers, dear. I'll be back in \n\t\ttwenty minutes. It's tulip season \n\t\ttoday. I'm so happy.\n\n\tAnd now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness \n\tdissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that \n\tquickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her \n\tapartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.\n\n<b>\tPOV - MELVIN UDALL\n</b>\n\tin the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, \n\tunsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever \n\tmet. Right now all his considerable talent and strength \n\tis totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the \n\televator door he holds open.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tCome here, sweetheart... come on.\n\n<b>\tON DOG\n</b>\n\tSniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. \n\tMelvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the \n\tmutt who has ignores him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tWanna go for a ride? Okay, \n\t\tsweetie?\n\n\tThe dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges \n\tand picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog \n\turine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG \n\tsensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\t\t(a malevolent tone)\n\t\tYou've pissed your last floor, you \n\t\tdog-eared monkey.\n\n\tThe dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much \n\tmeaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout \n\tshut with his hand and reaches for the door of the \n\tgarbage chute.\n<b>\t\t\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tI'll bet you wish you were some \n\t\tsort of real dog now, huh?

You ugly, \n\t\tsmelly fuck.\n\n\tAnd with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and \n\tlets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING \"ANOOOOS\" \n\tfrom the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment \n\tdoor opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON \n\tNYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with \n\tGothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of \n\ttrauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.\n\n<b>\tINT.

MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tMelvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to \n\tfive with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and \n\toff and on five times and makes a straight-line towards \n\this bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens \n\tthe medicine chest.\n\n<b>\tINT. MEDICINE CHEST\n</b>\n\tScores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps \n\tone -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the \n\tprocess two more times.\n\n<b>\tINT.

JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a \n\tlaugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As \n\tthe others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. \n\tJackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks \n\tsome awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts \n\tVerdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS \n\tin protest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON\n</b>\t\tJust for a second, okay?\n\n\tThe DOG YAPS \"no.\" Simon, delighted, picks him up again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON\n</b>\t\t\t(kissing him on the mouth)\n\t\tLook at him...  where was little \n\t\tbaby?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHANDYMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tIn the basement garbage bin eating \n\t\tdiaper shit.\n\n\tSimon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in \n\tcheek, trying to suppress his amusement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON\n</b>\t\tGo ahead, John, you earned your fun.\n\t\t\t(looking at Verdell)\n\t\tHow did he get down in the \n\t\tbasement?

How, she \n\t\twondered, could she find such hope \n\t\tin the most shameful part of her.'\n\n\tHe barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tMr. Udall.\n\n\tBut Melvin's into it.

So \n\t\tnever, never again interrupt me. \n\t\tOkay? I mean, never. Not 30 \n\t\tyears from now... not if there's \n\t\tfire. Not even if you hear a thud \n\t\tfrom inside my home and a week \n\t\tlater there's a smell from in \n\t\tthere that can only come from a \n\t\tdecaying body and you have to hold \n\t\ta hanky against your face because \n\t\tthe stench is so thick you think \n\t\tyou're going to faint even then \n\t\tdon't come knocking or, if it's \n\t\telection night and you're excited \n\t\tand want to celebrate because some \n\t\tfudge-packer you dated has been \n\t\telected the first queer President \n\t\tof the United States... and he's \n\t\tgoing to put you up in Camp David \n\t\tand you just want to share the \n\t\tmoment with someone...  don't knock\n\t\t...  not on this door. Not for \n\t\tanything. Got me. Sweetheart?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON\n</b>\t\tYes.

Simon turns serious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIMON\n</b>\t\tHe's genuinely upsetting, isn't \n\t\the?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWon't worry about it. You go \n\t\tahead.\n\n\tFrank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly \n\ton Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tOh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really \n\t\tpissed!!!\n\n\tFrank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. \n\tFrank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him \n\tforward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tNo touch. No touch. No touch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tYou may think you can intimidate \n\t\tthe whole world with your \n\t\tattitude, but I grew up in Hell. \n\t\tMy grandmother had more attitude. \n\t\tYou don't intimidate me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\t\t(calling)\n\t\tPolice!

Party!\n\n\tHe tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens \n\this shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as \n\the re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears \n\timpressed.\n\n<b>\tEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY\n</b>\n\tA crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His \n\twalk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the \n\tdanger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. \n\tAt times he places his palms together and extends his \n\tarms cutting a path through people. We will be very \n\tpointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.\n\n<b>\tCLOSER ON MELVIN\n</b>\n\tHis eyes focused on the terrain.\n\n<b>\tINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY\n</b>\n<b>\tANGLE ON WAITRESS\n</b>\n\tCAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. \n\tYou would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be \n\tthe most carefree time of the day. She is telling a \n\tstory about her son for the umpteenth time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\t\t(to the Mother's \n\t\t\tlittle girl)\n\t\tLook at you, you're all better.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n</b>\t\tIt's that new medication.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tYou know all my son's stuff, \n\t\tright?\n\n\tThe Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but \n\tCarol interrupts her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tNo, no, no, I got a date tonight. \n\t\tI'm walking out the door this \n\t\tmorning and he says to me, 'Mom, \n\t\tI promise not to get one of my \n\t\tfevers or coughs during your \n\t\tdate.'\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n</b>\t\tIsn't that sweet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tLittle blonde angle.\n\t\t\t(to child, \n\t\t\taffectionately)\n\t\tEat everything.\n\n\tMelvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a \n\ttable towards the back and is obviously surprised to find \n\ta MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tIt just came out of me. I said \n\t\tyou love me the way a remote \n\t\tcontrol loves a TV. As long as I \n\t\tswitch every time... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHER MALE COMPANION\n</b>\t\tWonderful.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tPeople who talk in metaphors can \n\t\tshampoo my crotch.\n\t\t\t(on their look)\n\t\tEat up.\n\n\tThey turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the \n\twaitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, \n\tare talking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA\n</b>\t\tPay me back next week.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tI owe you. I told you today... \n\t\tthem's the rules. Oh, excuse me, \n\t\tMelvin.\n\n\tShe puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out \n\tof the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else \n\tever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tI'm starving.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\t\t(firmly to Lisa)\n\t\tWill you please take it?\n\n\tMelvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with \n\tstealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out \n\tof the way... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA\n</b>\t\tThis way you take a cab home so \n\t\tyou have time to get ready for the \n\t\tdate.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\t\"Ready\" is not my problem.\n\n\tShe barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could \n\tread Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the \n\tdate talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\t\t(to Melvin)\n\t\tGo sit down. You know you're not \n\t\tallowed back here...  Spencer's \n\t\tmore excited about it than I am... \n\t\tHe says, \"Mom, I promise not to \n\t\tget a fever or couch during your date.\"\n\n\tThe other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go \n\t\"awww.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tI know.

I'm gonna miss the \n\t\texcitement, but I'll handle it.\n\n\tThere is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some \n\tingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only \n\tone in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear \n\tthe table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tThe table's fine if it had some \n\t\tcholesterol on it. Two sausages, \n\t\tsix bacon strips, fries, three \n\t\teggs over easy and coffee.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tYou're gonna die soon with that \n\t\tdiet, you know that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELVIN\n</b>\t\tWe're all gonna die soon.

Melvin \n\tsenses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tIf you ever mention my son again, \n\t\tyou will never be able to eat here \n\t\tagain.

Do you?!?\n\n\tA beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing \n\tdown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAROL\n</b>\t\tOkay. I'll get your order.\n\n\tShe walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower \n\tlip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.\n\n<b>\tINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tShe is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room \n\tsofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make \n\tnoises as she responds...  each time startling herself \n\twith her own noise and trying to reign it in.\n\n\tShe's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway \n\t-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the \n\temergence of this sexy self that she laughs.

And I'd be lying if \n\t\tI didn't say that I enjoyed your \n\t\tcompany... but the truth is you do \n\t\tbother me enormously and I know -- \n\t\tthink -- that it's best for me to \n\t\tnot have contact with you because \n\t\tyou're just not ready and you're a \n\t\tpretty old guy to not be ready... \n\t\tand I'm too old to ignore that. \n\t\tBut there were extraordinary \n\t\tkindnesses that did take place. \n\t\tSo thanks for the trips... \n\n\tShe's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than \n\tever.
