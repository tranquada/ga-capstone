A pre-recorded tape shows\n\ta view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.\n\tDR.

We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves\n\twith high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a\n\tmilitary presence.\n\t\n\tTHE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting\n\tfrantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARCUS (cont. Filter)\n\t\t\tFor God's sake, don't come in!\n\t\n\tThe CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into\n\tthe foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but\n\twe might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE\n\tSWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the\n\tsame laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its\n\tside on the floor.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)\n\t\t\tLook.  Here.\n\t\n\tA LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video\n\tscreen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN\n\tBODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.\n\tand LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The\n\timage SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC\n\tSTING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...\n\t\n\t\t\t        RESIDENT EVIL\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-2\n\t\n\tEXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN\n\t\n\tA DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL\n\tMOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black\n\teyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,\n\tyoung, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems\n\tperfectly in place, almost part of the environment.\n\t\n\tA band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of\n\tmagnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting\n\ton a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...\n\t\n\t...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through\n\tthe hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes\n\trecognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.\n\t\n\tThe regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...\n\ta freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above\n\tthe highest water.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tTake it, Goliath. It's yours.\n\t\n\t\"Goliath\" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tSee ya next year, guy.\n\t\n\tChris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another\n\ttrout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious\n\tCliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.\n\tANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tCleopatra.\n\t\n\tChris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.\n\t\n\t\"Cleopatra\" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.\n\tShe's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she\n\trecoils and climbs again, hovering.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tCome on. Come on down.\n\t\n\tThe eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another\n\tdive, but stops short again.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tWhat's the matter, beautiful?\n\t\n\tThe bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.\n\tGets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,\n\taway from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as\n\tit soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-3\n\t\n\tCLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear\n\tover the hills.\n\t\n\tOver his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the\n\tfish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight\n\tcatches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a\n\tsharp INHUMAN SOUND.\n\t\n\tChris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing\n\tat all. The fish has been taken.\n\t\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN\n\t\n\tCHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly\n\tsheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his\n\tbody is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.\n\tMoving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases\n\thimself into a bed where...\n\t\n\t...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast\n\tasleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her\n\teyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm\n\taround her and lets his body relax.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\t(A whisper) Glad you're still \n\t\t\there, lady\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tIt's my apartment.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\t(Surprised) You're awake.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tI've been awake. Since you left.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tSorry.\n\t\n\tHis apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what\n\thappened in the hills.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tThere was... something wrong.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tWhat, with my dinner? I never had\n\t\t\ta mother. I'll learn.\n\t\n\tChris smiles politely. He offers...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI'll do the cooking.\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-4\n\t\n\t...but he can't switch focus.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tOn the mountain...there...must\n\t\t\thave been something... prowling\n\t\t\taround up there.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tThere are probably all kinds of\n\t\t\tthings prowling around up there.\n\t\t\tIn the middle of the night.\n\t\n\tChris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI'm sorry. Really. You...have to\n\t\t\tbe there at dawn. They ride the\n\t\t\twind over the ridge.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tDawn? You left at one A.M.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI had to go fishing. It's the fish\n\t\t\tthat bring them down, so I can get\n\t\t\ta close look at them. (Enthused)\n\t\t\tI've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.\n\t\t\tTwelve of those big bruisers. I can\n\t\t\tactually recognize them. I've even\n\t\t\tgiven them names, over the years.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tYou've been doing this for years?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tOnly in the early Autumn. When\n\t\t\tthey're' migrating.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tI'II set the alarm for next. October.\n\t\n\tJill rolls over and faces him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL (cont.)\n\t\t\tI wish I could get excited. Really.\n\t\t\tThat's the truth. As excited as you,\n\t\t\tover such... simple things.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tBeauty... isn't simple. If it was...\n\t\t\tI'd be beautiful.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tYou are.\n\t\n\tPg-5\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tNo, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the\n\t\t\tother hand...(nuzzling closer)...have\n\t\t\tall that... stuff... hiding underneath\n\t\t\tsomewhere. That's what fascinates me.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tFascination. Not love?\n\t\n\tJill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,\n\tbecomes introspective.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI... honestly don't know. I guess\n\t\t\tI've been... living alone too long.\n\t\t\tYou're the first, the only woman I've\n\t\t\tever thought of as... a real partner.\n\t\n\tNow Jill becomes introspective.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tI've always been...afraid of living\n\t\t\talone. I've always had... people...\n\t\t\ttalking at me... knowing they could\n\t\t\twind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...\n\t\t\twhatever they wanted.\n\t\n\tChris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL (cont.)\n\t\t\tWe all have... something hidden...\n\t\t\tunderneath.  Beauty may not be simple.\n\t\t\tBut it's not all that complicated,\n\t\t\tEither.  Most of the time, you find\n\t\t\tIt... right in the middle of all the...\n\t\t\tconfusion.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI'm part Mohawk. Indians are never\n\t\t\tconfused. At least, they never let\n\t\t\tit show.\n\t\n\tThey kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,\n\tthey begin to make love.\n\t\n\tEXT   FARM   DAWN\n\tThe purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite\n\tdark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking\n\tdoor of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES\n\tout into the morning breeze.\n\t\n\tTwo dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake\n\topens a log gate.\n\t\n\tPg-6\n\t-\n\tTwo of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large\n\tcorral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,\n\ttossing its head in high spirit.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tRAKE\n\t\t\tGet in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'\n\t\t\taround. Get in.\n\t\n\t\"LUCKY\" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tRAKE (cont.)\n\t\t\tSwear. If I didn't know you was\n\t\t\tjust an animal, I'd say you was all\n\t\t\tfull of yourself. GET IN THERE!\n\t\n\tRake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a\n\tgreat deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind\n\tthe stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside\n\tthe fence. All seems lovely, until...\n\t\n\t...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They\n\tsniff the air...and begin to WHINE.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tRAKE (cont.)\n\t\t\tWhat's wrong with you two?\n\t\n\tKER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and\n\tthe other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their\n\tway out of the fencing. They seem terrified.\n\t\n\tCUT TO :\n\t\n\tA WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from\n\ttwo hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at\n\tfirst, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are\n\tseeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,\n\tcharging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...\n\t\n\t...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the\n\tKICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and\n\tCRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.\n\t\n\tEXT   AIR BASE   DAWN\n\t\n\tThe WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are\n\toverwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,\n\tarmed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.\n\t\n\tA RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an\n\topen receiver.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tRADIO MAN\n\t\t\tTop brass, sir!\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-7\n\t\n\tANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone.

Once again, we see no face.\n\tAn ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off\n\tthe end off a Monte Cristo.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAN WITH RING\n\t\t\tYou're good, soldier. But not that\n\t\t\tgood. It's five hundred miles away.\n\t\t\tIn the backwoods of Pennsylvania.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)\n\t\t\tWe have troopers on site. A first-\n\t\t\tstrike force. Under cover.\n\t\n\tThe flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAN WITH RING\n\t\t\tVery resourceful.  You have my\n\t\t\tpermission activate them.\n\t\n\tEXT   AIR BASE   DAWN\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAN WITH TATTOO\n\t\t\tI've already done that. You have my\n\t\t\tpermission... to say that you gave me\n\t\t\tpermission.\n\t\n\tTHE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING\n\t\n\tCHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...\n\t\n\t...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches\n\tdown and extracts something small and black, the size of a\n\tbox of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,\n\tchecking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-8\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING\n\t\n\t...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the\n\tsmall box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny\n\tmicrophone on its tip, and...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\t(Softly) Valentine.\n\t\n\tWe can't hear the voice that speaks to her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL (cont.)\n\t\t\tIf this is just another a drill,\n\t\t\tI'll strangle you. (She listens)\n\t\t\tShit. Give me the activation code.\n\t\n\tJILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks\n\topen a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is\n\tprinted... 29-RC-6735.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL (cont.)\n\t\t\t(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's\n\t\t\ta match. (Beat) I'm on my way.\n\t\n\tJill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope\n\tinto her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,\n\tblank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one\n\tcorner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the\n\tchain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING\n\t\n\tCHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and\n\tlooks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him\n\twhat's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She\n\tpulls herself away.\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING\n\t\n\tTCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her\n\tclothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET\n\tPANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed\n\twith COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.\n\t\n\tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING\n\t\n\tThe sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS\n\tawake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out\n\tand finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to\n\ta window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-9\n\t\n\tEXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING\n\t\n\t...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has\n\tan insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and\n\tjumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The\n\tvehicle pulls instantly away...\n\t\n\t...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,\n\tand very much wounded.\n\t\n\t\n\tINT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING\n\t\n\tRUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all\n\ttough Special-Forces types.

THE HUMMER bounces over\n\tnon-roads and stops fifty yards from...\n\t\n\t...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter \"A\".\n\tBeyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...\n\tA MANSION.

This area's been 'secure'\n\t\t\tsince the French and Indian War!\n\t\n\tA deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers\n\traise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The\n\tfog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze\n\tof dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...\n\t\n\tDARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen\n\tof them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and\n\tquickly types an access code.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\t(Into radio) This is Valentine,\n\t\t\tBravo Team.

Then, gradually, we see his face.\n\tLean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT\n\tWESKER, a hard-assed career officer.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWESKER\n\t\t\tCan you get a trace?\n\t\n\tThe pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tLAGUARDIA\n\t\t\tLost the beacon.

Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time\n\tto mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.\n\tPulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's\n\thand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tThe earth keeps us.\n\t\n\tConquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.\n\tHe shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads\n\tstraight over the field for the trees.\n\t\n\tAs the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING\n\tIN ON...\n\t\n\tPg-16\n\t\n\t...one of the farm dogs.

Unable to land\n\ton the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its\n\trotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER\n\tS.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper\n\tlifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.\n\t\n\tNOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he\n\tcan see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from\n\ttheir rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls\n\twithin a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,\n\tmoves closer, cautiously, on foot.\n\t\n\tTHE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.\n\tuniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all...

No survivors.\n\t\n\tIn the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He\n\tsees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWESKER\n\t\t\tWe're goin' in.  Watch your backs.\n\t\n\tWesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris\n\trushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for\n\thimself. \"Valentine \".\n\t\n\tAfter what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-\n\tpunched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.\n\t\n\tOne of the HUEYS dips in low.\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-18\n\t\n\tChris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from\n\tdefeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as\n\the tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,\n\tthose eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of\n\tsight as the helicopter swings lower.\n\t\n\tDowndraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching\n\tChris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.\n\tThe shrubs are being disturbed by...\n\t\n\tSOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes\n\tits head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his\n\tWinchester as the animal stalks forward.\n\t\n\tIt's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,\n\tcovered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding\n\tBULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.\n\t\n\tGROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!\n\t\n\tUp ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWESKER\n\t\t\tWho fired? WHO FIRED?\n\t\n\tBefore anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS\n\twhich BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and\n\tSHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of\n\tthem. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.\n\t\n\tAutomatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the\n\tanimals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.\n\tof his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.\n\t\n\tThe commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we\n\tsaw earlier.

STAND FAST...\n\t\t\tUNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !\n\t\n\tThe dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is\n\toverwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST\n\ttrips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing\n\tout his HEART... through his BACK.\n\t\n\tWesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with\n\tforty rounds from his M-16.\n\t\n\tPg-19\n\t\n\tIn the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.\n\tHe hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...\n\ttoo late.  The dog is about to land on him when...\n\t...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARRY\n\t\t\tEven-Steven, boss.

'Even-\n\t\t\tSteven' with anybody.  A man saves\n\t\t\tmy ass...I pay him back.  Before\n\t\t\tthis day is over, I'll pay you back,\n\t\t\tBarry.  Just... stick with me, okay?\n\t\n\tWesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.\n\tHe looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-\n\tLIGHT, he finds...\n\t\n\t...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But\n\tit's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it\n\tonto his belt.\n\t\n\tFROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone\n\tsilent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily\n\tto the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a\n\tCOLLAR which reads...\n\t\n\t\t\t\t  SPIKE #26\n\t\n\tAlongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the\n\tsymbol of an UMBRELLA.\n\t\n\tGRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims\n\this Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to\n\treload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog\n\tBOUNDS after him.\n\t\n\tChris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a\n\tTREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,\n\tpulling the root shut over him.\n\t\n\tThe dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry\n\thowl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw\n\tChris, nor where he went.\n\t\n\tThe forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even\n\tthe chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly\n\ton the back... by Barry.\n\t\n\tPg-20\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARRY\n\t\t\tLook here, man.

The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,\n\tpulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the\n\tflesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the\n\topenings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the\n\tkitchen. Those were its fingertips.

It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with\n\ta thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might\n\tbe on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous\n\tto Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,\n\tthe size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the\n\tmother of the deadly vines...\n\t\n\t...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal\n\tsize. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened\n\tCRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the\n\tfacility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier\n\t\"arms\", each of which act independently, like tentacles on\n\tan octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-60\n\t\n\tINT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS\n\t\n\tBURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and\n\ta ceiling VENT.

The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer\n\tTILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW\n\tPUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem\n\tdesigned to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be\n\table to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.\n\t\n\tThere are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on\n\tthe tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,\n\tlarger in diameter than any that might have been caused by\n\tbullets.\n\t\n\tAnd there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible\n\tbattle... or battles...took place here.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWESKER\n\t\t\tThis way.

The plant\n\tSHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT\n\tfrom boils that develop on its flesh, down along its \"arms\",\n\tand into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to\n\tthe floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human\n\tskulls might make.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAIKEN\n\t\t\tThey.. .they killed Sullivan. The\n\t\t\tbastards... whoever did this shit...\n\t\t\tthey KILLED SULLIVAN!\n\t\n\tEnraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks\n\tthe remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,\n\tnot stopping until he cuts into...\n\t\n\t...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!\n\tAiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's\n\tcoiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...\n\t...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.\n\tAs Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.\n\t\n\tThe snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the\n\tgreenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power\n\tof a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...\n\tTEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,\n\tinstantly CRUSHING his ribs.\n\t\n\tChris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a\n\tceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece\n\tin _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .\n\t\n\tAiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.\n\tChris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake\n\thas SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the\n\tbeast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the\n\tsnake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses\n\tall his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the\n\tsnake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\t(To Rebecca) Hold this.\n\t\n\tRebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-63\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS (cont.)\n\t\t\tGET IN HERE, SOLDIER!\n\t\n\tIn this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like\n\tWesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She\n\trushes in and takes hold of the rope.\n\t\n\tMoving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped\n\ton the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...\n\t\n\t...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's\n\tAiken... still alive.\n\t\n\tChris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking\n\tthrough layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.\n\t\n\tAiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest\n\thas been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the\n\tmonster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,\n\this face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAIKEN\n\t\t\tK-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd\n\t\t\tbe.. .better off dead. That...ain't\n\t\t\tnever been truer than now. Kill me!\n\t\n\tThe snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the\n\tceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's\n\tLIFTED, bodily, off the floor.\n\t\n\tThe rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The\n\ttrailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It\n\tdelays the snake for two seconds.\n\t\n\tThose fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach\n\tinto the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on\n\tTWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.\n\t\n\tThe giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him\n\tby inches.

The Tyrant is\n\ton him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...\n\t\n\t...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!\n\t\n\tThe rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal\n\theart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...\n\t\n\t...on top of Chris's legs.\n\t\n\tAs Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.\n\tTHREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.\n\t\n\tLaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the\n\tladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs\n\ton. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from\n\tunder the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.\n\tHe climbs frantically.\n\t\n\tAbove him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and\n\tRebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away\n\tover the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he\n\thangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his\n\thands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.\n\tONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\t(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We\n\t\t\thave to get out of range.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tNo. (To the pilot) Circle around.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLAGUARDIA\n\t\t\tAre there more survivors?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tNo. Just...circle, okay? I want\n\t\t\tto...take a last look.\n\t\n\tThe Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...\n\t\n\t\n\tEXT   AERIAL POV   DAY\n\t\n\t...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.\n\t\n\t\n\tINT   HUEY   DAY\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tIt's... your home.\n\t\n\tCHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tPg-95\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\tI hoped... it would be our home.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJILL\n\t\t\tI guess... we're gonna be moving.\n\t\n\tChris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHRIS\n\t\t\t(To the pilot) Full throttle.\n\t\t\tOut of here, man!\n\t\n\tLaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at\n\ttop speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by\n\tinertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,\n\tin the receding sky, he spots...\n\t\n\t...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.\n\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\t\n\tEXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY\n\t\n\tPLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-\n\tground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate\n\tas the shock-wave spreads outward.\n\t\n\t\n\tEXT   FARM   DAY\n\t\n\tChris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a\n\tZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.\n\t\n\t\n\tEXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY\n\t\n\tThe TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering\n\tdown Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave\n\tHITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS\n\tof two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .\n\t\n\t...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are\n\ttorn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of\n\twindow glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through\n\tnecks, chests, bellies...\n\t\n\t...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,\n\tthrough billows of dust... drooling hungrily.\n\t\n\tTHE SCREEN GOES BLACK.\n\t\n\t\n\t---\n\tThis text orginiated from www.New-Blood.com, please check them \n\tout for Resident Evil coverage.\n\t---\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResident Evil\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0George A.
