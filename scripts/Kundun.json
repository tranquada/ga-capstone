And chickens.  And we\n                            had four years of bad crops, all\n                            the farmers did.\n\n     Portrait of a mountain - Anye Machin II - twenty thousand\n     feet high and slightly obscured by clouds.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            In the night, I knew you were coming.\n\n     Now, the foothills.  The still photograph of this barren\n     mountain range comes to life as we see something moving.\n\n     It is a small caravan - traveling this narrow mountain pass.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            At dawn, you were born.\n\n     CLOSER on this caravan.  We can make out eight or ten men,\n     walking, and on horseback, dressed in heavy, brocade coats,\n     and large woolen hats, black braids trailing down their\n     backs.  A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks,\n     wearing maroon robes.\n\n     The caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns -\n     a sudden shift in direction - a switchback.  The travelers\n     head downhill.\n\n                                      BOY (VO)\n                            Tell me.\n\n     Now, we see the mens's destination.  A lake.  An incredibly\n     blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains.  It\n     is LHAMO I' LATSO - \"the Oracle Lake\" - and it shimmers in\n     the sunlight.\n\n     As the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the\n     curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it.\n\n     The man is dressed in royal robes.  He is young, twenty four\n     years old.  His name is RETING RINPOCHE.  He is the Regent\n     of Tibet.\n\n     The color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to\n     a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            You were a beautiful baby.\n                            So calm.\n         \n                                      BOY (VO)\n                            No cried?\n\n     The woman laughs.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            Maybe, just a little.\n\n     The palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the\n     lake.  The water's color changes again, to a deep purple,\n     then blue again, then red, then indigo.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            And that day, your father\n                            got better.  He named you Lhamo.\n                            \"The Protector.\"\n\n                                      BOY (VO)\n                            I know.\n\n     Silence.\n\n     The noblemen and monks surround Reting as he steps out of\n     the palanquin.\n\n     One man stands out here, a monk, a high lama in fact, with a\n     kind face and fantastic, mesmerizing eyes.  He is the LAMA\n     OF SERA.\n\n                                      WOMAN (VO)\n                            Go to sleep, Lhamo.\n\n     Reting stares at the lake.\n\n     The water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure\n     at first, then becoming more solid.  A vision.\n\n     He sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house.\n\n     The house has a flat, tile roof and an unusual, wooden rain\n     gutter, with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in\n     the courtyard.  A spotted dog is in front of the house,\n     barking, though we cannot hear him.  The vision becomes\n     completely clear, for an instant - clear enough to see the\n     face of a young boy at the window.\n\n     CLOSE on Reting Rinpoche.  Looking.  Searching.\n\n     Cut to:  a portrait of a mountain:  Kyeri - a majestic,\n     glacier mountain - the \"house mountain\" of the village of\n     Takster, Amdo Province, North Eastern Tibet.\n\n     Sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged,\n     mountain peak and then the view moves down, below the tree\n     line, and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands,\n     until it comes to rest on a small, stone, u-shaped house.  A\n     house caught in the dawn's mist.\n\n     CLOSE on the face of a sleeping child:  a boy, LHAMO\n     DHONDRUP, age two and one-half years.  He is dreaming.  He\n     is about to wake up.\n\n     Today, his life will change.\n\n     We stay on the boy's face until, slowly, his eyes open -\n     beautiful, dark, eyes.\n\n     INT.  TIBETAN PEASANT HOME, KITCHEN   DAWN (1937)\n\n     The MOTHER walks past the boy, her woolen skirt swaying in\n     the rosy light.  A seven year-old brother - LOBSANG SAMTEN -\n     and a teenage sister - TSERING DOLMA - share Lhamo's kitchen\n     mattress.  Lhamo looks at them, and then he turns to see the\n     heavy felt boots of his FATHER, as the man walks through the\n     room and out the door.  Lhamo finds the kind face of his\n     MOTHER.  She is looking at him.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN\n\n     The boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the\n     sounds of this country morning:  the snorting of horses,\n     clucking of hens, a command from the Father as the man feeds\n     the animals.\n\n     The boy scratches, he pees.  He sees his Mother on the roof.\n     She is a silhouette against the dawn, as she feeds cedar and\n     yak chips into the incense burner - sending white, curly\n     smoke up, to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of\n     printed mantras.\n\n     We pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark.\n\n     Lhamo's house is the house in the vision.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN  MORNING\n\n     It is a good day.  There is cheese for breakfast.\n\n     Lhamo's Father sits on a cushion at the head of a low table.\n     Fresh bread appears, yogurt, roasted barley (tsampa).\n\n     Lhamo pushes at his Father.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Me.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            No.  This must stop.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Me.  Here.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            I am the father.  You sit there.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Me here.\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            What is the harm?\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            He will grow up all wrong.\n                            Only you can serve him,\n                            only you can wash his bowl.\n                            Too tidy, everything just so.\n                            He must know his place.\n\n                                      LOBSANG SAMTEN\n                            He thinks he is king here.\n                            No respect.\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            What is the harm?\n\n     The Father reluctantly gets up and gives his seat to Lhamo.\n     Lhamo settles and waits for his Mother to hand him his bowl\n     of tsampa.  He bestows a most beautiful smile on his family.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAY\n\n     The Father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses\n     when there is a sudden commotion.\n\n     The CHINESE GOVERNOR is passing through this little village.\n\n     He is a ferocious looking man, dressed in ornate brocade,\n     his horse eguipped with tack that looks like armor.  He is\n     surrounded by a dozen Chinese soldiers, all on huge horses,\n     ruling the road, kicking up mud.\n\n     Lhamo's Father stops.  He holds still.  He looks to the\n     house.\n\n     The Mother is holding the children against her in the\n     doorway.  Quiet.  Watching.\n\n     The Governor and his entourage move on.  When they are out\n     of sight, Lhamo's Father makes his departure.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAY\n\n     Lhamo straddles the window sill, slapping his bottom as if\n     he were a horse, shouting:\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            I go away.\n                            Look, mama, I go away.\n                            Far, far, far.\n\n     His Mother is making bread in the kitchen.\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            Oh, no.  Where will he go?\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Far, far away.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN  DUSK\n\n     Lhamo is playing a game with pebbles on the raised, wooden\n     platform in the kitchen.  The fire is lit.  He is alone.\n\n     The dog begins to bark.\n\n                                      MOTHER (OC)\n                            Good day.\n\n                                      MAN (OC)\n                            Good day.\n\n                                      MOTHER (OC)\n                            Please, come in, so cold.\n\n                                      MAN (OC)\n                            We are traveling to Lhasa.  May\n                            we...?\n\n                                      MOTHER (OC)\n                            Of course, please, this way.\n                            Your servant may use the kitchen.\n\n                                      MAN (OC)\n                            Thank you.\n\n     A middle-aged man, the SERVANT, wearing heavy, ragged\n     clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen.\n\n     Lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform\n     beside him.  The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them -\n     he knows the game.\n\n     We recognize this servant.  His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE.\n     He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one\n     with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of\n     Sera Monastery.\n\n     Lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and\n     immediately pulls at the string of beads.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Mine.\n\n     The Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy.\n     Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck.  The\n     Servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but Lhamo\n     resists.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Mine.\n\n                                      SERVANT\n                            Mine.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Please.\n\n                                      SERVANT\n                            I will give it to, if you can\n                            tell me who I am.\n\n     Lhamo looks up, into the man's piercing, black eyes.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            The Lama of Sera.\n                            You come.\n\n     The Mother enters and immediately sees the rosary around her\n     son's neck.  She gives it back to the Servant.\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            Lhamo, no.\n\n     Lhamo goes back to his game.  The Mother hands the tired man\n     a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea.  The man's\n     hands are shaking.  He cannot look the woman in the eye.\n\n                                      SERVANT\n                            Thank you.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN\n\n     The travelers make their departure at dawn.\n\n     As the party reaches the gate, Lhamo runs from the house,\n     crying:\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Wait!  No!\n\n     The men stop.  Lhamo runs to the Servant.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Me, too.

The drum and the bell he chooses\n     quickly.\n\n     Keustang Rinpoche watches the boy gather the items.  He\n     looks at the yellow silk and the boy's small, fine hands.\n     He dares not look directly at the boy.\n\n     Lhamo picks up one walking stick - a lovely, bronze-handled\n     one.  He swings it around, but he finally rejects it in\n     favor of a plain, iron-handled stick.  He makes his own pile\n     of these things, then looks at the Lama of Sera.\n\n                                      KEUSTANG RINPOCHE\n                            Yes, those are yours.\n\n     Keustang Rinpoche takes the boy's hands in his own.

There is\n     a little birthmark, like a conch shell, on his shoulder.\n\n     Keustang Rinpoche pulls up the boy's pants legs.  There is a\n     funny skin marking on the legs, like tiger stripes.\n\n     The Lama rearranges the boy's clothing, then one more time,\n     takes the beautiful, little hands in his own and whispers:\n\n                                      KEUSTANG RINPOCHE\n                            \"Kundun\"\n\n     He says to the others, in a soft, secretive voice:\n\n                                      KEUSTANG RINPOCHE\n                            He is the Presence.\n\n     In the background, by an open curtain, we see Lhamo's\n     Mother.\n\n     She says, softly:\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            My oldest boy is an incarnation.\n\n                                      KEUSTANG RINPOCHE\n                            So is your youngest.\n\n     Keustang releases the boy's hands and brings his own closed\n     palms up to his forehead.\n\n                                      KEUSTANG RINPOCHE\n                            I wish you long life.\n\n     The Mother begins to cry.\n\n     INT.

As a result of Lhamo's tears, Lobsang\n     begins to cry.  Takster holds them both.  The music\n     continues. The older, wiser, Takster begins to cry, too.\n     The three brothers hold one another.  Three brothers, three\n     monks, crying for their mother.

The two\n     begin to squabble.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            You have all the room.\n\n                                      LOBSANG\n                            Don't be a baby, move over.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            You move.\n\n                                      LOBSANG\n                            You!  You think you are so\n                            big!\n\n     They hit and pinch until finally the movement of the\n     carriage stops.  The Driver reaches in through the open\n     curtains and separates the boys, each to his own side of the\n     dreljam.\n\n     Inside his tiny carriage, young Lhamo now sits quiet and\n     composed.\n\n     EXT.  CAMPSITE  NIGHT\n\n     A cluster of fantastic, Tibetan tents are set up; white\n     cotton tents, with sharp corners, peaked ceilings and\n     elaborate, appliqued designs.  Campfires glow, animals bed\n     down, stars shine overhead.\n\n     INT.  TIBETAN TENT  NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a group of ancient, stern-faced MONKS.\n\n     CLOSE on the baby-faced, Lhamo Dhondrup.\n\n     One Monk pulls a huge pair of scissors from his robes.\n\n     Lhamo makes a dive for the tent's door.\n\n     EXT. TENT  NIGHT\n\n     Standing outside the tent is a BODYGUARD - a huge, burly\n     man, wearing monk's robes.  He turns to the boy.  In one\n     hand he holds a big stick.  His face is distorted and\n     deformed by a large tumor under one eye.  It is a\n     frightening sight.  He looks like a monster to the child.\n\n     Lhamo jumps back inside the tent.  The Bodyguard closes the\n     appliqued flap.\n\n     INT.  DRELJAM  DAY\n\n     Lhamo has had a haircut.  His Mother walks beside the\n     carriage, holding his hand.\n\n                                      LHAMO\n                            Who am I?\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            We do not know.\n\n     EXT. PLAINS OF TIBET  NIGHT\n\n     By candlelight, Lhamo is transferred from the rugged, simple\n     carriage, to one of exquisite, yellow silk.\n\n     INT. PALANQUIN  JUST BEFORE DAWN\n\n     Lhamo peeks out of the silk curtain as he hears the arrival\n     of many horses, many men.  SOLDIERS - hundreds of Tibetan\n     soldiers - surround the palanquin.\n\n     EXT.  PLAINS, OUTSIDE LHASA  DAWN\n\n     The yellow palanquin is carried across a human border of\n     Tibetan noblemen.  These fantastic-looking men and women\n     part, and drop to the ground in prostration, as the\n     palanquin moves through their welcoming committee.\n\n     INT. PEACOCK TENT  DAWN\n\n     Lhamo walks along a long, patterned carpet, looking up, at\n     this lofty tent's stunning, blue silk, ceiling.\n\n     He is led to a tall, wooden throne, and he is lifted, and\n     then he climbs to the top.  Lhamo settles in a cross-legged\n     position on the brocade cushion.\n\n     He looks down.\n\n     Hundred of monks, abbots, noblemen, Nepalese, Bhutanese,\n     Chinese, even a red-headed Englishman - they all bow to\n     Lhamo.\n\n     Reting Rinpoche, the young Regent of Tibet, the man who saw\n     this boy's face in his vision, stands below the throne.  He\n     addresses the crowd:\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            Chenrezi, the Buddha of compassion.\n                            The Wish Fulfilling Jewel.\n                            The Fourteenth Dalai Lama.\n\n     And the Regent turns, hikes up his gorgeous robes, and\n     prostrates before the child.\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            Long life.\n\n     In the crowd stand Lhamo's Mother and Father and Lobsang\n     Samten.\n\n     On their faces, we must see that they did not realize who\n     their son, their brother, was believed to be.\n\n     First the Mother, and then the Father, bow in front of their\n     youngest child.\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            Long life.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            Long life.\n\n     Finally, Lobsang.\n\n                                      LOBSANG\n                            Long life, Lhamo.\n\n     We hear the sound of a great, Tibetan horn.\n\n     We hear peels of childish laughter.\n\n     INT.  THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     Lobsang and Lhamo skid, slide, skate down the endless,\n     slippery hallways of this huge, labyrinthine monastery.\n\n     Three Monks scurry behind the boys, trying to keep up,\n     trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of\n     their sight.\n\n     They shout, in loud stage whispers:\n\n                                      MONKS\n                            Kundun!  Kundun!\n\n     The monks are no match for the little boys, who are quickly\n     out of sight.\n\n     INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     Reting Rinpoche sits cross-legged on the floor of this\n     brightly-painted, red room.\n\n     Across from him sits Lhamo, dressed in fine, yellow silk.\n\n     These are simple rooms, decorated with statues, deity\n     scrolls and mandalas, an altar to Buddha.  Behind a glass\n     case are toys, mixed in with the Buddhist artifacts:  dolls,\n     puppets, balls, blocks, trains.\n\n     Reting Rinpoche is speaking.\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            Centuries ago, a young boy was\n                            born.  His name was Gedundrub.\n                            The night of his birth, robbers\n                            came to his home and his family\n                            fled hiding the baby in a cattle\n                            pen. When they returned the next\n                            day, the baby was safe. They found\n                            him guarded by a pair of black crows.\n\n                            He was the first Dalai Lama.\n\n                            The Living Buddha of Compassion.\n\n                            Now, you have chosen to come back to\n                            this life once again.\n\n     Reting blows his nose.\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            We name you Tenzin Gyatso.\n\n     CLOSE on Lhamo - Tenzin Gyatso.\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            Your job is simple.\n                            You are to love all living things.\n                            Just love them.  Care for them.\n                            Have compassion for them.\n\n                            \"As long as any living thing draws\n                            breath, wherever he shall be, there\n                            in compassion, shall the Buddha\n                            appear, incarnate.\"\n\n     At the curtain behind Lhamo, we notice the curly-toed shoes\n     of a monk, a man who must be standing in the next room.\n\n     INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY\n\n     In the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom, we now see\n     the three Monks who chased the young boy down the slippery\n     halls.\n\n     They are the Dalai Lama's personal attendants - the MASTER\n     OF THE RITUAL, the MASTER OF ThE KITCHEN, and the MASTER OF\n     THE ROBE.  (It is the Master of the Kitchen who stands\n     directly behind the curtain.)\n\n     The LORD CHAMBERLAIN is also there.  He is a monk.  A tall,\n     angular man, with almost nordic features:  large, round\n     eyes, a yellowish mustache, sharp nose.\n\n     All of these men will become quite familiar to us, as will\n     the man standing, listening, behind the attendants.\n\n     He is a sweeper, a man named NORBU THUNDRUP, age thirty.  He\n     is tall, and gangly, with a wispy beard and a pock-marked\n     face.\n\n     INT.

ADJACENT ROOM  DAY\n\n     The Regent walks through this room on his way out.\n     A passing look from Norbu lets us know that Reting\n     Rinpoche is not well-liked.\n\n                                      RETING RINPOCHE\n                            He will see you now.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain goes to meet with the Dalai Lama.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DAY\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain bows to the boy and then unpacks his\n     parcel.\n\n     He has a rolled, parchment document.\n     He has a beautiful, carved, wooden box.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain points to the mural on the wall behind\n     the boy.  It is an elaborate, story-painting.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            Fifth Dalai Lama.\n\n     The boy looks.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain points to a golden statue of a round\n     man in a peaked hat.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBBERLAIN\n                            Seventh Dalai Lama.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso nods.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain lifts a framed photograph of a bald,\n     charismatic man, with razor sharp eyebrows, pictured sitting\n     on a throne.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            Thirteenth Dalai Lama.\n\n     The boy looks at the photo.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain places the state seal in the young\n     boy's hands and indicates that the boy should bring the\n     heavy instrument down hard on the parchment.\n\n     The boy does.  The Lord Chamberlain scribbles a little\n     something on a tab of attached paper, then bows to the boy.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            Fourteenth Dalai Lama.\n\n     VIEW FROM A HIGH WINDOW\n\n     Outside, up a country path, young herders lead their cattle\n     in from the grazing fields.

The Chinese would\n                            try to control our trade, as they did\n                            once before, control our contact\n                            with the outside world.\n\n     INT.  HALLWAY  DAY\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and Tenzin\n     Gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades\n     away.\n\n     As the two walk down the hallway, Tenzin Gyatso spots an\n     unusual wooden door.  He lets the Lord Chamberlain get a\n     little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door.\n     It is heavy.  It almost opens.\n\n     INT.  HALLWAY  LATER, DUSK\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso and his brother Lobsang are pulling at the\n     heavy door.  Behind them, in the distance, we hear:\n\n                                      MONKS (OC)\n                            Kundun!  Kundun!\n\n     The door opens.  The boys disappear inside.\n\n     INT.  STORAGE ROOM  DUSK\n\n     A treasure awaits them.\n\n     It looks like Aladdin's cave - full of odd, European items.\n\n     There are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded\n     mirror, a lacquered rocking horse.  There are hats,\n     umbrellas and even a pair of lace-up, cordovan shoes.\n     Tenzin Gyatso lifts a reel of film.  There are piles of\n     magazines and books.  There is a stack of tires in the back\n     corner.  The boys uncover a train set and a good collection\n     of lead soldiers.  The Dalai Lama pockets a gold watch.\n\n     Just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them\n     at the door, Tenzin sees something truly spectacular.  It is\n     a telescope.\n\n     The monks enter the room as the young Dalai Lama reaches for\n     this miracle.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            What is it?\n\n                                      THE ATTENDANTS\n                            Ah, it is a telescope, Holiness.\n                            With this you can see a long way.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            And, is it mine?\n\n                                      ATTENDANT\n                            These are all gifts sent to\n                            your predecessors.\n\n                                      LOBSANG SAMTEN\n                            Yes!  Then it is yours!\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I need it.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     We are in the adjacent room, listening, as Norbu Thundrup\n     tells a bedtime story.\n\n     Golden butter lamps burn before a statue of Buddha.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP (OC)\n                            One night, not too long\n                            ago, an old monk saw a woman in that\n                            very same hallway where you ran away.\n\n     INT.  BEDROOM  NIGHT\n\n     The boy is in bed.  The Sweeper finishes-off his story as\n     the boy wiggles deeper under the covers.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            She carried a basket in\n                            her arms, a big, heavy basket, and\n                            the old monk cautiously approached.\n                            She opened her basket and showed what\n                            she had.  Heads.  Human heads. Only\n                            the heads.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Is that true or pretend?\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            It is a story, you decide.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Pretend.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            As you say.\n\n     The Sweeper tucks the boy in as the Master of the Robe\n     finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a\n     smile, the two men leave the room.\n\n     A mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on\n     the altar before the Buddha.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to\n     see if those curly-toed shoes are visible under the\n     partition.  They are.  The Master of the Kitchen is still\n     near.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the\n     covers.  He pries and digs at the back of the watch until he\n     succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous\n     insides.\n\n     Finally, Tenzin Gyatso's eyelids grow heavy.  The camera\n     passes over his face, as his eyes close.\n\n     The boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            \"I be an island for those who\n                            seek one, a lamp for light.\"\n\n     We find two scrolls;  the first is PENDEN LHAMO, the special\n     protectress of the Dalai Lama.\n\n     She rides her wild mule through a sea of blood - between\n     rows of jagged mountains.  Pointed fingers and spreading\n     toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed - the details\n     are incredible.  A garland of freshly severed heads hangs\n     around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form\n     ber crown.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO (VO)\n                            \"May I be a bed for all who wish\n                            to rest,\n                            and a slave for all who want a\n                            slave.\"\n\n     Beside her, on the second scroll is MAHAKALA.  He is the\n     fierce representation of the Buddha of Compassion.  Crows\n     fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six-\n     armed figure.\n\n     A skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a Trident is\n     held in the left hand.  The deity wears a crown of five\n     skulls.  He has three eyes.  He tramples an elephant.\n\n     We might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves\n     back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young Dalai\n     Lama.  Asleep.\n\n     The camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of\n     the Fifth Dalai Lama.  It is a fantasy of green, with\n     mountains and lakes and deities and monsters.\n\n     We find the statue of Seventh Dalai Lama, sitting on his\n     golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the\n     Thirteenth Dalai Lama.  Fantastic.  Deeper.  Deeper.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            \"May I be wishing jewel, a magic\n                            vase...\n\n     VIEW THROUGH AN EYEPIECE\n\n     We see the Dalai Lama place his young eye at the viewfinder.\n\n     EXT.  TERRACE, POTALA  DAY\n\n     Norbu Thundrup holds the boy steady.\n\n     And, a wondorous view of Lhasa is presented.\n\n     Vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing\n     turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols.  Animals are\n     herded through town by young boys.  Children play and\n     squabble.  A white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons -\n     political posters - picturing the Regent, perhaps, as a man\n     holding too much power.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I want to go down there.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            You can only go with attendants and a\n                            big ceremony.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I want to run down the street.\n                            I want to buy a toy.  Eat from\n                            the shops.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            You cannot.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I want to be a shepherd, taking those\n                            goats and cows out to the hillside.\n\n                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n                            But you are not a shepherd, you are\n                            the Dalai Lama.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Maybe in the next life, the\n                            world will not need a Dalai Lama.\n\n                                      NORNU ThUNDRUP\n                            I would not know.  Maybe.\n\n     The view travels and we see a prison yard.  Shackled men\n     share the yard with hairy, fat dogs.\n\n     One man looks up and sees that the yard is under\n     surveillance.  Of course the men all know that this terrace\n     belongs to the boy Dalai Lama.\n\n     As the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another\n     prostrates.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso pulls away from the telescope.  He waves to\n     the prisoners.\n\n     EXT.  VALLEY OUTSIDE LHASA  DAY  (SUMMER, 1942)\n\n     The boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk.\n\n     He is older now, seven or eight.  He peers through the\n     curtain.\n\n     A grand procession carries the Dalai Lama from the Potala to\n     his summer residence, the Norbulinka.\n\n     Monks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy,\n     wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest\n     parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms.  There are\n     horses, banners and carriages.  Bodyguards carry the Dalai\n     Lama's possessions - wrapped in yellow silk.  A band plays,\n     \"God Save the King.\"\n\n     It is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road,\n     Tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to\n     look at him.\n\n     EXT.  THE NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     Establishing shot of this lovely park.\n\n     Zt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming\n     expansiveness of the Potala.  It is filled with deer and\n     antelope, peacocks and nesting birds.  An eccentric\n     collection of trees grow here - some indigenous, some\n     gifts - bearing flowers and fruit.  There are fish ponds and\n     even a Kyichu river tributary nearby.\n\n     We find the young Dalai Lama standing by this tributary\n     daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone.  An\n     Attendant gently pulls him back.\n\n     Beyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying\n     sheep towards town.  The boy watches.  He listens to the\n     herder's song.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama drops bits of food into a fish pond.  He\n     calls the huge, lazy fish to come eat.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Little ones first, only\n                            little ones.\n\n     The boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick.\n\n     EXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow\n     wall (which separates the Dalai Lama's residence from the\n     rest of the Norbulinka), and up the steps leading to a\n     white, one story, home - his parent's.\n\n     INT.  PARENT'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     A startling, blue room.\n\n     The young Dalai Lama leans on the table where is Father sits\n     eating pork rinds.\n\n     Lobsang is there, practicing his writing on a chalk board.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso grabs one pork rind, then another, then a\n     third.\n\n                                      LOBSANG SAMTEN\n                            The Dalai Lama is not supposed\n                            to eat pork.  It is not good for\n                            your brain.\n\n     The Father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the\n     table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a\n     point.\n\n     The Dalai Lama takes another, and then, suddenly, the boy\n     reaches up and for no reason, he pulls on his Father's\n     mustache, obviously hurting the man.  The Father slaps the\n     boy's hand, hard.\n\n     The boy sits back, and begins drawing imaginary letters on\n     the tabletop with his slapped hand.\n\n     His Father reaches out and takes the hurt hand.  He pulls\n     the boy into his arms.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            I am sorry, Lhamo.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            It is alright, Father.\n\n     The Master of the Robe knocks at the door.  Father and son\n     look up.\n\n                                      MASTER OF THE ROBE\n                            Kundun, you must come back now.\n\n     The young boy sits straight up on his Father's lap and says,\n     defiantly:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Go away.\n\n     The surprised Monk backs away from the door.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            Not the way to talk to people.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Can I do anything I want?\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            No.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            But, I am in charge.\n\n                                      FATHER\n                            Are you?

ENTRANCE HALL, DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA,\n           DAY\n\n     The boy runs up the stairs and towards the old men, but he\n     stops and looks at a small cabinet standing, unobtrusively,\n     in a corner.  Tenzin Gyatso goes to the cabinet and rattles\n     the locked door.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            My teeth!

DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, EVENING\n\n     A bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table.  Tenzin\n     Gyatso sits in front of this table.\n\n     A monk is chanting in low, deep tones, in the background.\n\n     The Dalai Lama's teacher, TAKTRA RINPOCHE, sits on the\n     floor.  (Being the teacher, Taktra Rinpoche sits slightly\n     higher than the Dalai Lama.)  Taktra is an older man, in his\n     sixties.  He is stern, solid, no-nonsense.\n\n     Taktra Rinpoche begins a prayer.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            \"I take refuge in the three jewels,\n                            The Buddha, the Dharma and\n                            the Sangra.\"\n\n     But the boy leaps up from his table and goes to Taktra and\n     hangs around his neck, shouting:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            You recite!\n                            You recite!\n\n     Taktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            \"I take refuge in the three jewels,\n                            The Buddha, the Dharma and the\n                            Sangra.\"\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso releases the Lama and goes back to his own\n     table.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            \"Until I attain enlightenment.\"\n\n     Taktra Rinpoche has a small table with the same hand\n     instruments in front of him.  The teacher lifts the dorge,\n     in a particular fashion, and rotates it.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso lifts his dorge.  Taktra's hands move to the\n     boy's and show him the correct movement.  It is tried again.\n     Now, the bell is lifted and rung.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I would like you to be my new\n                            Regent.\n\n     Taktra stops.  He nods to the boy.\n\n     As the chanting continues, Taktra Rinpoche begins a weaving\n     motion with his hands, delicate, beautiful, hypnotic.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso copies the elder.\n\n     We are CLOSE on the boy's moving hands. The chanting becomes\n     the voices of a hundred men, as we FADE OUT.\n\n     FADE IN:  on the boy's hands, but they are a little larger -\n     they are the hands of an eleven or twelve year-old boy - and\n     the motion they carry out is on the verge of becoming\n     extraordinarily beautiful.\n\n     INT.  DARK ROOM, POTALA  EVENING (1944)\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso sits alone, in a small, dark green, room.  He\n     is older.  His robes have changed slightly, his manner is\n     more refined, more dignified.\n\n     He is on a retreat.\n\n     There is a soft knock at the door.  The door is opened and\n     food is placed inside the small room by bodiless hands.\n     Tenzin Gyatso collects his food.  He sips his tea and eats\n     his tsampa, while reading from a long, narrow stack of\n     scriptures.  Thangkas of MILERAPA - the great Tibetan poet\n     and teacher - hang on the walls.\n\n     We notice the curly-toed shoes of the Master of the Kitchen,\n     just visible beneath the wooden door.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD, THE POTALA  NIGHT\n\n     The boy walks alone, moving to the rhythm of a memorization.\n     His breath consolidates in the cold night air.  The sky is\n     brilliant with stars.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO (reciting)\n                            \"As long as any living thing draws\n                            breath, wherever he shall be, there,\n                            in compassion, shall the Buddha\n                            appear, incarnate.\"\n\n     INT.

Attachment,\n                            desire, envy, hatred, greed,\n                            unkindness, wrong view and so forth -\n                            these are some causes of suffering.\n\n     Now we CUT BACK to Ling Rinpoche, but he is standing,\n     outside, in a courtyard.  He asks another question, but he\n     raises his right hand as he speaks, and lowers his left,\n     completing the question with a clap of the hands.\n\n     EXT.  COURTYARD, THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     It is a beautiful, blue-sky day.  The Dalai Lama is learning\n     \"debate\".  High Lamas sit on tapestry pillows, under\n     appliqued canopies, observing.  Young monks can be seen,\n     watching, from a greater distance.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain sits to one side.  Taktra Rinpoche, now\n     Regent, is beside him.\n\n     The Dalai Lama sits on the ground at Ling's feet.\n\n                                      LING RINPOCHE\n                            How does one progress from\n                            the realization of one Noble Truth to\n                            another?\n                            (clap)\n\n     A long silence from His Holiness.  The Lamas wait on tender\n     hooks.  Finally, the boy says:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            We will have to think about that.\n\n     There is laughter.  Even Ling Rinpoche laughs and the boy\n     erupts into his beautiful, free, easy laugh.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I need to squeeze this brain.\n\n                                      LING RINPOCHE\n                            Answer.\n                            (clap)\n\n     A pause, and then:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            When one understands that\n                            he causes some of his own suffering,\n                            needlessly, then he looks for\n                            the causes in his own life.\n\n                            And when and he looks for those\n                            causes, when he investigates,\n                            then he is putting confidence\n                            in his own ability to eliminate\n                            the sources and end the suffering.\n\n                            A wish to find a path to peace\n                            arises.

SAME COURTYARD  DUSK\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso runs up a slant board and leaps off the edge -\n     a big jump, a flying leap.  He falls to the ground, then\n     gets up, laughing, and runs up the board again.\n\n     The same old monks who watched him debate, watch him play.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain and Taktra Rinpoche are among them.\n     The Lord Chamberlain obviously loves watching his young\n     charge play.

DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  NIGHT\n\n     The Nechung Oracle is the protective deity of Tibet.\n\n     Tonight, he is in full trance.  It is an amazing sight.\n\n     The monk who is his medium spins and twirls, he wags his\n     heavy headdress about.  A round mirror glitters on his\n     chest.  Sweat pours from his brow, over his wildly grimacing\n     face.\n\n     The Oracle spits at the government officials in the room.\n\n     Horns blow, cymbals crash, incense burns.  The Oracle nears\n     the Dalai Lama and retreats from him.  Finally, he whispers\n     in the boy's ear.\n\n                                      ORACLE\n                            Heed the warning of your predecessor.\n                            Or the war will end here.\n\n     And then, the Oracle gently straightens Tenzin Gyatso's\n     yellow robes, before the trance ends and the Oracle falls\n     into the arms of his attendants.\n\n     INT.

These vehicles are\n     manned by beautifully detailed lead soldiers - British World\n     War One Field soldiers, French Legionaries and American\n     Artillery men.\n\n     Norbu Thundrup, is flying low with a tsampa~dough airplane.\n     He drops little tsampa-dough bombs from his hand.  He hits a\n     tank and knocks down a few lead soldiers.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Oh, nicely done, Norbu.

GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     His Holiness works on an old movie projector.  A white-\n     haired, CHINESE MONK works with him.  The old Monk has very\n     little patience.  He bangs his hand on the table, and huffs\n     and puffs as the two try again to fiddle with this and that.\n     Tenzin Gyatso works diligently and calmly.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Patience is the first of the Six\n                            Perfections.\n\n     The old Monk mutters something in Chinese.  They thread a\n     roll of dusty film into the reel and spin the wheel.  The\n     film breaks.  The old monk bangs the table again.  The work\n     continues.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            One day, we will get that automobile\n                            running.\n\n     The monks slaps his head in horrid anticipation.\n\n     INT.  DARK ROOM, NORBULINKA  NIGHT\n\n     A movie begins, shown on a piece of cloth tacked to a wall.\n\n     It is a newsreel - footage from World War One. The\n     trenches.\n\n     The boy goes up to the cloth screen and touches it gently,\n     playing with his own shadow as men dash from foxholes across\n     a muddy, body strewn field.\n\n     The boy steps back and stares at the horror of real war;\n     men sleeping in the muddy foxholes, make-shift hospitals\n     tend the dying.  Youths - not much older than His Holiness -\n     weep into their filthy, bloody hands.\n\n     The Old Monk keeps his trembling hand on the noisy, hand-\n     operated, projector.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso slowly sits, cross-legged, on the bare floor.\n\n     War does not look good on film.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  NIGHT\n\n     The boy sits alone, in front of his altar, praying.\n     Meditating.\n\n     INT.  ALTAR ROOM, THE NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     A black room, lit by butter lamps.\n\n     Taktra Rinpoche and Tenzin Gyatso sit opposite one another,\n     cross-legged on the floor.  Taktra is the teacher, he sits a\n     bit higher.\n\n     The room is a shrine to Mahakala, the Dalai Lama's personal\n     deity.  Mahakala is present, in the form of a huge, golden\n     statue.\n\n     The boy has his head bent low to catch the Rinpoche's words.\n     There is much gesturing, much murmuring.  We might catch\n     only a word or two.\n\n     An oral teaching is being passed on, a lineage teaching.  It\n     is sacred and secret.\n\n     EXT.  UPPER COURTYARD, THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     CLOSE on a thangka of Penden Lhamo.\n\n     We hear monks debating.

It is the BBC - with news of a Communist\n     advantage in Kuomintang China.\n\n     Norbu Thundrup enters.

DALAI LAMA'S TERRACE  NIGHT\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso is alone.  He has a little smelting\n     arrangement built out on the terrace.  He lays a lead\n     soldier on the hot bottom of a heavy, metal bowl.\n\n     CLOSE on the soldier.  It begins to melt.\n\n     The boy has a pile of the soldiers.  He drops a second one\n     in the bowl.\n\n     We bear the sounds of Lhasa - laughter, street songs - and\n     we see the stars, hanging, it seems, just above the young\n     boy's head.\n\n     EXT.  NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     The young Tenzin Gyatso bursts through the gate in the\n     Yellow Wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his\n     parents's home.\n\n     INT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     A family gathering meets the boy's eye when he enters.\n\n     There is his Mother, his oldest sister, Tsering Dolma,\n     Lobsang Samten, a younger sister, Pema, baby brother Tendzin\n     Chuta, and his oldest brother, Takster.\n\n     We don't recognize these faces, of course, but the gathering\n     is obviously familial.\n\n     Only the boy's Father is missing.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso goes to his Mother and lays his head in her\n     lap.\n\n     On an altar behind her, is a silver frame.  In the frame is\n     a picture of her husband.\n\n     DREAM SEQUENCE\n\n     EXT.  HILLTOP  DAWN\n\n     The body of the Dalai Lama's Father lays on a flat boulder.\n\n     Incense smoke curls into the air.  Prayer wheels are turned,\n     hand drums are played - the burial men stand off to one\n     side, their hatchets and knives in view.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso is present.  He is the boy we know, but beside\n     him stands the four year-old boy, Lhamo, from the beginning\n     of the movie, and on the other side of him stands the boy\n     who will play the Dalai Lama in the next section of the film\n     -  a boy about fifteen or sixteen.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist.\n     The beads catch the brilliant afternoon light.  The sixteen\n     year-old Dalai Lama wears the same colored rosary around his\n     left wrist.\n\n     The cutters move in to the corpse, and as we hear them begin\n     the work of dismembering the body, the view pans up to\n     reveal the vultures circling overhead.\n\n     The last person leaving the hilltop with is the Dalai Lama\n     as an older man - not a character from this movie - but a\n     man of about fifty years, wearing glasses, wearing the same\n     robes, the same rosary.  Little Lhamo walks beside him.\n\n     END DREAM SEQUENCE\n\n     EXT.  SKY OVER TIBET  NIGHT\n\n     We hear a loud explosion, and then another and another and\n     another.  The sound begins to fade, but the blue-black,\n     peaceful, star-filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of\n     red and yellow and pink light.\n\n     It is a frightening sight.\n\n     EXT.  GARDEN, NORBULINKA  DAWN (1950)\n\n     The still waters of the fish pond begin to move.  The fish\n     swim in nervous circles;  the water laps over its stone\n     banks.\n\n     EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  DAWN\n\n     The whole building shakes.  Earthquake.\n\n     One monk runs down the stairs, another monk runs up, both\n     staring at a second floor window - a black-rimmed, glass\n     window.\n\n     A red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened.\n\n     The fifteen year-old Tenzin Gyatso looks out.\n\n     There is a terrible rumbling:  the rumbling that accompanies\n     an earthquake.  Finally, slowly, the sound, and the movement\n     subsides.\n\n     CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso.  He lets the curtain fall.\n\n     INT.

But, I am one voice.\n                            The Dalai Lama has always trusted in\n                            the forces of Buddha.

The boy watches\n     the herders, and before the young shepherds disappear from\n     sight, the Dalai Lama turns and waves a hand behind him.\n\n     Two Bodyguards approach.  We can not hear, but as the Dalai\n     Lama walks away from us, down the river, one Bodyguard runs\n     up river, shouting:\n\n                                      BODYGUARD (shouting)\n                            We will buy them!

ALTAR ROOM, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     In this black room, under the protective view of the statue\n     of Mahakala, a divine lottery is performed.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso, the Regent Taktra Rinpoche, The Lord\n     chamberlain, the Kashag, the Yigstang and the Tsitang are\n     all present.\n\n     Tsampa-dough balls are made, three of them, each containing\n     a strip of parchment, bearing writing.  The dough is shaped\n     and weighed to see that each ball is equal.\n\n     Then, the three balls are placed in a silver bowl and the\n     bowl is spun.  The balls whirl, race, and finally one leaps\n     from the bowl.\n\n     This ball is taken to the Dalai Lama and he makes a mark on\n     it.  The ball is returned to the bowl, the procedure is\n     repeated, and a ball leaps again, almost immediately.  This\n     ball is presented and the Dalai Lama places his mark - next\n     to the mark he just made.  It is the same ball.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso makes the twelfth mark on the same ball, and\n     the spinning begins again and then the thirteenth mark, and\n     then the ball is broken open and the strip of parchment\n     handed to the Regent.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            We should not accept any conditions\n                            from the Chinese.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     In a paved area, adjacent to the Yellow Wall which marks the\n     Dalai Lama's private grounds, the Opera Festival has begun.\n\n     This festival involves performances by Tibetan singers,\n     dancers and actors.  It looks to be a joyous occasion;\n     officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and\n     sit before beautifully laid picnics.  Children run here and\n     there, amidst the monks and nomads, the swashbuckling\n     Khambas from eastern Tibet (large people, with heavy braids\n     wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads).  There are\n     westerners, Nepalese and Sikimese.\n\n     Dancers - dressed in wild, colorful outfits - spin and leap\n     in time to the eerie, Tibetan music.\n\n     Atop a low building on the Yellow Wall, stands an elaborate\n     enclosure - draped in yellow silk.\n\n     The Dalai Lama sits inside it.\n\n     INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso is alone in this little room;  his arms rest\n     on a window ledge as he stares down at the festival taking\n     place below him.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS  DAY\n\n     A bit more of the dancers and the people enjoying themselves\n     - all from the isolated point of view of the Dalai Lama.\n\n     We recognize a few characters:  Keustang Rinpoche.  His\n     Holiness's Mother with her younger children, the favorite\n     sweeper, Norbu Thundrup - dressed in a fine hat.\n\n     But a distant figure becomes apparent - he is a MESSENGER -\n     he is running, through the crowds, toward the Yellow Wall.\n\n     We stay on this desperate little figure as he draws closer.\n\n     INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY\n\n     The boy is watching the Messenger.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS  DAY\n\n     Back to that messenger as he works his way, ever closer to\n     the building which holds the Dalai Lama aloft, and then we\n     lose sight of him.\n\n     INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso leans back in his seat.  The yellow silk\n     curtain that his elbows have held open now fall closed and\n     we hear the heavy footsteps of the runner.\n\n     A knock.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE (OC)\n                            Enter.\n\n     The Regent is next door.\n\n     The boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window\n     in the wall which separates this enclosure from the\n     Regent's.\n\n     Taktra Rinpoche reads a telegram.  His aging\n     face becomes quite grave.\n\n     The Regent leaves his side of the enclosure.\n\n                                      REGENT (OC)\n                            Summon the Lord Chamberlain and\n                            the Kashag.\n\n     And then, there is a knock on the Dalai Lama's door.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Enter.\n\n     It is the Regent.\n\n                                      REGENT TAKTRA\n                            Holiness.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Yes.\n\n                                      REGENT TAKTRA\n                            The Chinese have invaded.\n\n     EXT.

Horns blow, cymbals\n     clash, the Oracle spurts sounds as lamas chant.\n\n     Finally, the Oracle approaches the boy, stands beside him,\n     like a lieutenant, a comrade, and says:\n\n                                      ORACLE\n                            \"His time has come.\"\n\n     EXT.

Butter lamps highlight certain faces\n     - members of the Kashag, noblemen, the tutors, an\n     Englishman, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetan Muslims - but the\n     darkness conceals the great number of people present.\n\n     We hear the unmistakable Tibetan horns and cymbals. We hear\n     the chanting of monks.\n\n     The boy is handed a Golden Wheel, symbolizing the assumption\n     of temporal power.\n\n     At one moment, the Lamas all put on their yellow hats - a\n     color that peeks at us out of this dark room.

DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DUSK\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso is packing.  We hear whispers in the adjacent\n     room as the Masters of the Robe and the Ritual organize\n     belongings into piles:  rolled thangkas, precious\n     manuscripts, maroon robes, a few english books, the radio.\n\n     The boy finds a few golden coins in a drawer and slips them\n     into his robes.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso adds a package of tools, an atlas, the photo\n     of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, the European shoes.  Then, he\n     goes to the terrace.\n\n     EXT.  TERRACE, THE POTALA  DUSK\n\n     The boy does not need a footstool anymore.\n\n     He glides the telescope across the countryside, catching\n     sight of the young herders leading their sheep back into\n     town.  He picks up a corner of the market place and the hub-\n     bub of the end of the day.

The Dalai Lama notices, too.\n     A member of the Kashag takes the document.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU\n                            We come in genuine friendship.\n\n     CLOSE on the Dalai Lama.\n\n     He makes no response.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU\n                            I am certain you wish to return to\n                            Lhasa.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso remains silent.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU\n                            Do you have plans to return soon,\n                            Dalai Lama?\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Soon.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU\n                            Good.  Our first request is that you\n                            allow us to build a road.  You have\n                            no roads in Tibet.  We can discuss\n                            the plans in Lhasa.

He opens to the last page and looks at\n     the impression made by the state seal.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Counterfeit.\n\n     He closes the document and hands it back to the official.\n\n     EXT.

But, he is only\n                            a man, just an ordinary human\n                            being, like myself.  Life is\n                            always a lesson.\n\n     EXT.

They\n                            believe you should leave now,\n                            for India.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            If I were to go into exile, could we\n                            expect any serious assistance, from\n                            India, suppose?\n\n                                      LORD CHANBERLAIN\n                            It is unlikely.  America, perhaps.\n                            There is great anti-communist feeling\n                            in America.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            At this point, the most likely\n                            result of a foreign pact is war.\n\n                                      LORD CHAABERLAIN\n                            The Chinese would see such a\n                            pact as an open declaration of war.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Tibet, at war?

After countless people\n                            die, China would still, always,\n                            be close.  We will work\n                            with what we have.\n\n                                      KASHAG MEMBER\n                            And as for your own safety, Holiness?\n\n     A pause.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I am scared.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            Shall we consult the protective\n                            deities, Holiness?\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            My first and foremost duty is to\n                            protect my people.

But I believe\n                            this - things will change.\n\n     The boy snaps his fingers.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Impermanence.\n                            Our own short lifetimes are\n                            not the only valid consideration.\n\n                            I shall return.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso is asleep.  We have not seen him this still,\n     this peaceful, in a long time.  He sleeps in the \"Buddha~\n     pose\" - on his right side9 his head resting in his right\n     hand.  The wall behind him is white.\n\n     We begin to hear the unique Tibetan music.\n\n     DREAM SEQUENCE\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso rides a grey mule across the empty, mysterious\n     landscape of Tibet.\n\n     The boy is back in his own home in Amdo province.\n\n     But, he is not the baby he was when he left there, he is\n     sixteen.  His family is together, but they are all the sizes\n     and ages they were at the beginning of the story.  Tenzin\n     Gyatso is very happy, sitting on the raised platform in the\n     kitchen, playing a game with pebbles.\n\n     Taktra Rinpoche - the aged Taktra - enters and sits down\n     beside him.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            I hope you will not feel badly\n                            about all the things of childhood\n                            you missed.\n\n     The boy does not speak, just looks, kindly, at the man.\n\n                                      TAKTRA RINPOCHE\n                            You lost so much.

He is awake.  He is older.\n     Twenty.  But, there is something ageless about him, now.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, THE POTALA  PRE-DAWN\n\n     The boy begins this day.\n\n     He is in his old room at the Potala, in Lhasa.  The green\n     mural of the Fifth Dalai Lama is behind him.  He has risen.\n     from the red-curtained bed.\n\n     The Masters of the Kitchen and the Robe arrive and begin\n     their preparations for the day.\n\n     A NEW SWEEPER works in the adjacent room.\n\n     The sun rises.\n\n     EXT.  THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     Like a painting, the beautiful monastery fills the screen\n     with its white walls and red roof.\n\n     Shouting is heard.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG (OC)\n                            I hate meeting here, this\n                            tribute to the past!

To serve you.\n                            Chairman Mao wants you to feel that\n                            China belongs to you now.\n\n                                      LUKHANGWA\n                            Chairman Mao can keep China.\n                            Just give us back Tibet.\n\n     The General backs away and brings himself under control.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG\n                            Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army\n                            into the People's Army will soon be\n                            finalized.\n\n                                      LUKHANGWA\n                            I will not approve it.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG\n                            Then, we will begin with replacing\n                            the Tibetan flag with the flag of the\n                            Motherland.\n\n                                      LUKHANGWA\n                            And we will begin with tearing\n                            it down.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso stands between these furious men.  He raises a\n     hand, silently requesting peace.\n\n     EXT.  TERRACE  DAY\n\n     We hear the sound of martial drums and trumpets and tubas.\n\n     The Dalai Lama is at his telescope.\n\n     Three thousand PLA soldiers march along the shepherds's\n     trail.  They march behind huge, red banners of Mao Tse-tung\n     and Chu-te.\n\n     This time, the soldiers do look like monsters.  Their faces\n     are grey - coated with Tibetan dust.  Their peaked hats look\n     vaguely like horns, their tattered, khaki uniforms like\n     rough hide.\n\n     Monks line the trail, whipping at the soldiers with their\n     long, maroon robes.  Women and children spit at the Chinese,\n     clap at them, hoping to chase this evil away.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DAY\n\n     The Prime Ministers, Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi, submit\n     their resignations to His Holiness.\n\n     The boy takes the roll of parchment from them.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I am so sorry.\n\n                                      LUKHANGWA\n                            It must be done.\n                            We can no longer meet with the\n                            Chinese, they refuse us.\n         \n     We hear the sounds of those Chinese tubas and trumpets.\n     We hear trucks.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I accept your resignations.\n\n                                      LOBSANG TASHI\n                            Have you chosen your new Prime\n                            Ministers, Holiness?\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            There will be no new Prime Ministers.\n\n                                      LUKHANGWA\n                            You will face great difficulties,\n                            Holiness.\n\n     The boy affixes his small piece of parchment to the document\n     and makes a mark on it.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            They have taken away our silence.\n\n     EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama, with much pomp and ceremony, walks down a\n     white carpet and steps into a coracle.\n\n     The entourage includes:  the Lord Chamberlain, the Kashag,\n     His Holiness's Mother and youngest Brother, tutors and\n     attendants.\n\n     A hundred monks stand, chanting, on the far bank.\n\n     EXT.  PLAINS OF TIBET  DAY\n\n     The Fourteenth Dalai Lama rides in a Chinese jeep.  Dust\n     surrounds him.  A yellow silk umbrella shades him.\n\n     We see that a road is under construction - a road into\n     Lhasa. The first road in Tibet.  The Dalai Llama is travelling\n     in the opposite direction.  He is leaving his country,\n     traveling on rugged, flattened earth.\n\n     EXT.  BARREN COUNTRYSIDE  DAY\n\n     The way is tougher here - the Dalai Lama is on mule back.\n\n     EXT.  CHINESE BORDER TOWN, SHINGANG  DAY\n\n     This is a different land.  There are rice paddies and water\n     buffalo.  The altitude and barrenness of Tibet have been\n     replaced by greener pastures, jagged mountaintops and\n     Chinese natives.\n\n     INT.  AIRPLANE  NIGHT\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso gets his ride in an airplane - an antique. It\n     is bumpy and noisy.  He sits on an un-upholstered, steel\n     frame.\n\n     INT.  TRAIN  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama travels by train.\n\n     INT.  TRAIN STATION  DAY\n\n     The train pulls into the station.\n\n     There are hundreds of people awaiting the arrival of the\n     Dalai Lama - hundreds of \"China pictorial\", red-cheeked,\n     Chinese communists;  men, women and children, waving little\n     red flags.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso steps off the train and there is a roar of\n     approval.   Song breaks out - the People's Republic National\n     Anthem.\n\n     The young man is overwhelmed.\n\n     We begin to sense that something is wrong, something is\n     artificial.  The people's presence is demanded here today.\n     This is a forced display of regard.\n\n     INT.  GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama, and his retinue sit in this Great Hall,\n     decorated with a portrait of Chairman Mao.\n\n     The Great Helmsman himself is speaking.\n\n     Mao Tse Tung's presence is charismatic.  His delivery is\n     powerful - simple, yet firm.  He is spellbinding.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            The mission of China is to bring\n                            progress to Tibet.  Develop its\n                            natural resources.  Help its\n                            people develop democracy.\n                            We welcome you, Tibet, back to\n                            the Motherland!\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, CHINESE GUEST HOUSE  NIGHT\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso snoops around this room.  He opens drawers,\n     cabinets, just as a child would.  He finds odd little pieces\n     of ceramics, pens, paper.\n\n     He moves to the bathroom, runs a bath.  Hot water.\n     Electricity.  This is the modern world.\n\n     INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama sits beside Chairman Mao as a horde of\n     photographers flash bulbs in their faces.  Mao offers His\n     Holiness a plate of Chinese delicacies.\n\n     We notice that Mao's clothes are shabby and old. (His suit\n     is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey-drab).\n     His cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn.  But, his shoes,\n     are beautifully polished.\n\n     He has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny.\n\n     Later, Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama sit across from one\n     another.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso takes notes as Mao speaks.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            I am so glad that Tibet has\n                            come back to the Motherland.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso quietly sips his tea.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            You must inform me at once if\n                            any of our people abuse the\n                            Tibetans trust and good nature.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I have great hopes for the future of\n                            our co-operation.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            It is too early to implement all the\n                            clauses of the Seventeen Point\n                            Agreement.  We will establish a\n                            Preparatory Committee for the\n                            Autonomous Region of Tibet.  The pace\n                            of reform must meet with the\n                            desires of the Tibetan people.\n                            Changes must be made slowly, as you,\n                            yourself, judge necessary.\n\n     Mao speaks and moves very slowly.  He pants and wheezes.  He\n     appears to be sick.  Tenzin Gyatso takes notes.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I am happy to hear you say this,\n                            Chairman Mao.  I have created a\n                            reform committee to investigate\n                            grievances and we have abolished\n                            Inherited Tax, and forgiven all\n                            money owed the Government by\n                            people who are unable to pay.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            Good. Very good.\n                            Tibet is a great country.  A\n                            a wonderful history.  Long ago, you\n                            even conquered part of China.\n                            But now you have fallen behind and we\n                            want to help you.  In twenty years\n                            time you could be ahead of us.\n                            Then it will be your turn to help\n                            China.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso writes in his notebook.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            You know, I have great respect for\n                            your Lord Buddha.  He was anti-caste.\n                            Anti-corruption.  Anti-exploitation.\n                            For some, politics and religion can\n                            mix.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            For me, I think such a mix is\n                            crucial.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            Have a sweet. Made in my home\n                            province.  The kind my mother used\n                            to make.\n\n     The Dalai Lama accepts.\n\n     EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso does physical exercise with a few Chinese\n     Bodyguards.\n\n     EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso studies with Ling Rinpoche.\n     The Lord Chamberlain sits with them.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            \"If moral discipline is learned\n                            from the beginning, one possesses\n                            the root for achieving higher\n                            rebirth.  A staircase for achieving\n                            liberation.  An antidote eliminating\n                            misery and sorrow.

Co-operation.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain simply looks at the young man.  He has\n     nothing to say.\n\n     INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT\n\n     There is a knock and Tenzin Gyatso is led into the room.\n\n     Mao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for\n                            coming so late.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I leave tomorrow.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            Yes, I am aware.  How has your\n                            time in China been?\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso sits. He takes out his book and pen, ready to\n     take notes.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I have been greatly impressed by your\n                            accomplishments.

Tibet has been poisoned\n                            by religion.\n\n     The boy cannot look up.  He is in shock.

We must see on his\n     face that he realizes it has all been lies.  All the kind\n     words and promises, it must all be lies.\n\n     He is unable to raise his face to Mao's.  All he sees before\n     him are those shinny shoes, those exquisitely shaped,\n     glistening hands.\n\n     EXT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT\n\n     Outside this building, a black car is waiting.  It is\n     bitterly cold.\n\n     Mao - wearing no hat, no coat, and coughing - opens the door\n     for the boy.\n\n     The Dalai Lama shakes the man's hand.\n\n                                      MAO TSE TUNG\n                            Take care of your health.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso gets into the car and Mao slams the door.\n\n     INT.  CAR  NIGHT\n\n     As the car drives away, Tenzin Gyatso turns to see the\n     Chairman, still standing in the cold, still waving goodbye.\n\n     Then, Tenzin Gyatso looks straight ahead and says:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                           He will betray us.\n\n     The view pulls back. The Lord Chamberlain sits beside the\n     young man.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBEPIAIN\n                           Did you ever doubt it?\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                           I had relinquished doubt.\n\n     EXT.  TENZIN GYATSO'S HOUSE IN AMDO  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama and members of his retinue stand in front of\n     his old house in the village of Taktser, Amdo Province.\n\n     The young man smiles as he enters the courtyard.  He pauses\n     to look at the prayer flag, flapping in the breeze.\n\n     He opens the front door.\n\n     INT.  HOUSE  DAY\n\n     A family of relatives inhabits the house.  They bow to His\n     Holiness as the young man makes his way to the kitchen.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso steps into the kitchen - he might have to bend\n     his head under the low ceiling.  He laughs his wonderful\n     laugh.\n\n     Immediately, a woman approaches with a cup of tea.\n\n     But the hand of a Chinese official reaches out, takes the\n     tea and returns it to her.  It is not permitted.\n\n     The woman looks confused.  Tenzin Gyatso is humiliated.\n\n     EXT.  HOUSE  DAY\n\n     A group has gathered outside the house.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso goes toward them as they prostrate.  When they\n     have finished, he reaches out his hands to take theirs.\n\n     He says to one old woman:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Are you happy?\n\n     The OLD WOMAN says, with tears in her eyes:\n\n                                      OLD WOMAN\n                            I am very happy and prosperous\n                            under the guidance of the Chinese\n                            Communist Party and chairman\n                            Mao Tse Tung.\n\n     It is a horrifying announcement.\n\n     The Dalai Lama touches her head.  She weeps and clutches his\n     hands.\n\n     The young man looks up, over her head, to Kyeri, the\n     protectress mountain of this small village.\n\n     We hear loudspeakers, blaring, in the background -\n     trumpeting propaganda about Chairman Mao and the People's\n     Liberation Army.\n\n     Tibetan horns blow.  It sounds like a warning.\n\n     CLOSE on a newspaper.  It is a Chinese newspaper and the\n     picture on the front page shows a row of severed, Tibetan\n     heads.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso puts the paper down.  He removes his glasses\n     and turns to his advisor - the grand Lord Chamberlain.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I ask them to stop, to lay\n                            down their guns.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            The Khamba's gun is his most prized\n                            possession.  I admire them so.\n                            They face a modern, well equipped\n                            army, and still, they fight.\n\n     The Dalai Lama rubs his face with his hands.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            Land reform is underway in Amdo.  The\n                            large estates are being confiscated\n                            and redistributed.

He aims the telescope.\n\n     Below him he sees a new Lhasa - a Lhasa full of trucks and\n     Chinese soldiers.  A traffic island stands in the center of\n     an intersection.  The town walls are white-washed.  The\n     political posters are gone.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE NORBULINKA DAY\n\n     A small group sits waiting on red velvet chairs: the Dalai\n     Lama, the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag.\n\n     General Chiang enters the room. He finds a chair and pours\n     himself a cup of tea.  We cannot help but notice - he is\n     armed.\n\n                                      GENERAL CHIANG\n                            We have decided that no drastic\n                            changes will take place in Tibet\n                            for six years.

But we\n                            want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs\n                            it, not for China.\n\n     The General starts to speak but Tenzin Gyatso keeps talking.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Buddha is our physician, General, he\n                            will heal us.

PRAYER ROOM, NORBULINKA  NIGHT\n\n     The Nechung Oracle is in full swing.  It is an especially\n     vivid and violent spin he is in.  The headdress whips this\n     way and that, and finally he says:\n\n                                      NECHUNG ORACLE\n                            Where there is no crossing\n                            a big river, no fords, no\n                            shallows, where the only hope is a\n                            boat, and there is no boat...\n                            I will put a boat, Kundun.\n\n                            The wish-Fulfilling Jewel will\n                            shine from the West.\n\n     It is a strange and confusing prophecy.\n\n     EXT./ INT.

People\n     we know - uembers of the Kashag, attendants, tutors, the\n     Dalai Lama's Mother, sweepers - appear in the garden, one by\n     one, all listening to the sounds of a uob gathering outside\n     the walls of the Norbulinka.\n\n                                      WOMEN AND HEN (OC)\n                            Chinese, GO!\n                            Chinese, GO!\n                            Chinese, GO!\n\n     INT.

PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama enters his Mother's home.\n\n     It is very guiet here.  The young man looks at the family\n     photographs on the blue walls, the needlework on the table,\n     the seven copper bowls in front of the statue of Buddha.\n\n                                      MOTHER (OC)\n                            Did you come to tell me we are\n                            leaving Lhasa?\n\n     The boy fills the seven bowls with water.  His Mother lights\n     the butter lamps.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Do you think I must?\n\n                                      MOTHER\n                            You decide.\n\n     He says, softly:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Tibet has never been part of\n                            China.  We are different races.\n                            We are different cultures.\n                            We need change, we know that.\n                            But we could do it alone.\n                            We were just about to do it\n                            alone.\n\n     The young man fills the last bowl with water.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I am afraid I will go.\n                            Far, far away.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DUSK\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain approaches the Dalai Lama as he leaves\n     his Mother's house.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            We are now accused of aiding the\n                            rebels.  The Chinese said we can\n                            expect drastic measures to be\n                            taken to crush this revolt.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Arrange for me to speak to the\n                            people's leaders.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain hurries away.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK\n\n     A last meeting in session.\n\n     The Kashag is present, as are fifty leaders of the\n     opposition - rough, tired men.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I fear that there will be great\n                            bloodshed if you cannot convince\n                            the people to disperse and go home.\n                            I am safe.\n\n                                      FIRST LEADER\n                            Holiness, the Chinese tried to entice\n                            you to their garrison with\n                            out protection of bodyguard.\n                            Even now, they urge you to come\n                            to them for safety. They are\n                            bringing more troops and guns and\n                            artillery into Lhasa.\n                            There are three airplanes waiting\n                            outside Lhasa. What do they wait\n                            for?  They are planning to kill the\n                            Dalai Lama.  Don't you see?\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     The Dalai Lama consults the Nechung Oracle.  Alone.\n\n     The Oracle whispers:\n\n                                      NECHUNG ORACLE\n                            Stay.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     It is late at night.  The boy is alone.  He sits in front of\n     his altar - meditating.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     The Nechung Oracle is brought in.  The monk quiets himself\n     and readies himself for the trance.\n\n     The Dalai Lama waits.  Again, alone.\n\n     Slowly, the trance comes on, the heavy headdress is placed\n     on the monk's head, the attendants leave the room and then,\n     the Oracle speaks.\n\n                                      NECHUNG ORACLE\n                            Stay.  I tell you to stay.\n\n     EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  DAY\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain hurries up the stairs.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso steps forward, out of the shadows.\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            The Chinese are planning to attack\n                            the crowd and shell the Norbulinka.\n                            You are asked to indicate on a map\n                            where you will be so that the\n                            artillery men will not mistakenly\n                            aim at you.\n\n     The Dalai Lama walks down the outdoor stairs.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Tell them I will be here.\n                            With my people. Right here.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY\n\n     The young man is studying with Ling Rinpoche. Books of\n     scripture are stacked in front of him.\n\n     Suddenly, there is a tremendous, loud explosion, and then,\n     another.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso gets up and runs to the window he looked out\n     of the day of the earthquake.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY\n\n     There is shouting and chaos.  The Chinese have begun\n     shelling the Norbulinka.  The north wall and the grounds\n     directly in front of it are on fire.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM  DAY\n\n     This time the Oracle is in the room first.  He is surrounded\n     by his attendants and the members of the Kashag, the Lord\n     Chamberlain, Ling Rinpoche and various tutors and lamas.\n\n     The tension is thick.  Finally, the Dalai Lama enters.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso sits.  He waits.  The trance begins, the\n     headdress is set upon the medium's head and the Oracle\n     begins to dance, and then, he begins to shout:\n\n                                      ORACLE\n                            Go!  Go!  Tonight!\n\n     The Oracle staggers forward, snatches up some paper and a\n     pen and begins to draw a map, a route, out of Lhasa.  He\n     keeps repeating:\n\n                                      ORACLE\n                            Go!  Tonight!  Go!\n\n     CLOSE on the map - drawn with a shaking, sweating hand.\n\n     We see mountains, and a pass, and the names of towns along\n     the way.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso rises and goes to the Oracle.  He looks down\n     at the map.  The Oracle hands the Dalai Lama the map and\n     faints as his frightened attendants rush to loosen the strap\n     of the headdress before the poor man chokes.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK\n\n     The boy sits at the table, writing.  We can hear the crowd,\n     shouting, outside the Norbulinka walls.  We see just a few\n     words of the letter:\n\n                            Please do not resist.\n\n                            Take refuge on the far side of the\n                            river.\n\n     Attendants pack, quietly and quickly.\n\n     INT.  ALTAR ROOM  NIGHT\n\n     The chapel of Mahakala.\n\n     We are reminded of secret, sacred moments, from long ago.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso opens the heavy, creaking door.  The Dalai\n     Lama is in disguise.  He is wearing the clothes of a Khamba\n     guerrilla - dark, woolen chuba and tall black boots.\n\n     Monks sit on the floor, chanting.  One monk stands by a\n     large urn, ladling out butter for the lamps.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso goes to the front of the room.\n\n     A monk begins to play the cymbals. Another puts the\n     Tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long, mournful note.\n\n     The Dalai Lama lays a white silk scarf - a kata - over the\n     shoulders of this imposing statue.\n\n     Then, he sits for a moment.\n\n     In the weak light, in the black room, Tenzin Gyatso is lost\n     among the other praying monks.\n\n     EXT.  HALLWAY OF RESIDENCE  NIGHT\n\n     The Dalai Lama walks down the hall.  He says to a sweeper:\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Dim the lights.\n\n     and then he bow bends down, to pat a dog.\n\n     INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso rolls the thangka of Penden Lhamo and slides\n     it into its ancient container.\n\n     The young man places the scroll over one shoulder.\n\n     INT.  ENTRANCE OF RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA  NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance\n     hall.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso's hands open the doors.\n\n     The young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false\n     teeth.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat.  He tucks\n     the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the\n     scarf.  He places the bundle in the drawer.\n\n     Then, he adds something.  A sweet.  The kind his Mother\n     makes.\n\n     He closes the drawer, and locks it.\n\n     He hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive\n     cabinet.\n\n     EXT.  RESIDENCE, STAIRS  NIGHT\n\n     With a soldier on either side of him, the Dalai Lama\n     descends the staircase.\n\n     The Soldiers start to lead him away, but he pauses.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Wait.\n\n     The young man leaves them.\n\n     EXT.  RESIDENCE  NIGHT\n\n     He walks to the far side of this white building.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I see a safe journey.\n\n     The boy returns to the front steps.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I see a safe return.\n\n     The soldiers wait.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            Now.  I am ready.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder.  A\n     soldier lays a rifle over the other one.\n\n     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  NIGHT\n\n     The three men walk quietly through the empty gardens.  We\n     hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder.\n\n     EXT.  WALL  NIGHT\n\n     The soldiers pause, look to His Holiness.  Tenzin Gyatso\n     removes his glasses, puts them in his bag, then nods - and\n     the soldiers open the gate.\n\n                                      SOLDIER\n                            Move aside, tour of inspection,\n                            move aside.\n\n     Of course, we see only a fraction of the crowd - angry men\n     and women.\n\n     A man steps beside His Holiness.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso looks up - face to face.\n\n     It is the Khamba bodyguard, the monk who guarded him so many\n     times.  The man with the horrible face.\n\n                                      KHAMBA BODYGUARD\n                            Move aside, let us through.\n                            Move aside!\n\n     The Dalai Lama is between the soldiers, shouldering his own\n     gun.  The Bodyguard falls in behind.\n\n     The little group makes its way through the crowd.\n\n     EXT.  TRIBUTARY OF ThE KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT\n\n     In the same place where the little Tenzin Gyatso tentatively\n     tested one rock, the escape party crosses on the slippery,\n     stepping stones.\n\n     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT\n\n     The small party makes its way across a bit of countryside.\n\n     People are camped here - Khambas, farmers, nomads.  The\n     Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed.\n\n     EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT\n\n     Coracles await.\n\n     The Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside\n     him.  The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on\n     the bank, alone.\n\n     Every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso looks back.  He puts on his glasses.\n\n     He sees camp fires and the glow of torches.  He hears echoed\n     voices.\n\n     He looks up.  He sees the stars and the moon and that\n     incomparable Tibetan sky.\n\n     He looks forward.\n\n     He sees mountains.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I have always loved mountains.\n\n     He is handed a steaming cup of tea.\n\n     And then, a cloud passes over the moon.\n\n     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT\n\n     On horse back, the party makes its way up a mountain pass.\n\n     There are more members now - Tenzin Gyatso has joined those\n     who left ahead of him - members of the Kashag, tutors, his\n     Mother, his Brother.\n\n     It is tough going.  The ground seems like quick sand with\n     every step a struggle.  When the horses have disappeared\n     from sight, a sand storm arises, wiping away their tracks.\n\n     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT\n\n     The party passes above an encampment of Chinese soldiers.\n     They are not seen.\n\n     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  DAY\n\n     The party travels through the emptiness.\n\n     EXT.  MOUNTAIN PASS  DUSK\n\n     His Holiness walks beside his horse.\n\n     He joins other members of the group standing on a ridge.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            \"Right will be victorious.\"\n\n     And now, the others do the same.  The Lord Chamberlain says:\n\n                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n                            \"The Gods will be avenged!\"\n\n     EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF TIBET  DAY\n\n     The Dalai Lama sits before a low table set up on this\n     desolate border.\n\n     A document is before him.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I repudiate the Seventeen Point\n                            Agreement\n\n     With a slap of the State Seal of Tibet, this is done.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain removes this document and replaces it\n     with another.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I constitute the Government\n                            of Tibet, the only legal\n                            authority in the land.\n\n     The seal comes down hard once more.  It is done.\n\n     EXT.  BORDER  DAY\n\n     A sick and tired Tenzin Gyatso makes the last leg of his\n     trip on the back of a black yak.\n\n     Before him, through the light rain, we see a small bamboo\n     arch erected in the middle of nowhere.  Six Indian GHURKAS,\n     wearing floppy, jungle hats and heavy, British boots, stand\n     at attention.\n\n     The Dalai Lama, on his black yak, passes under this babboo\n     gateway as the Indian Soldiers raise their guns in salute.\n\n     An Indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man\n     from his mount.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso stands, barely able to hold himself on his\n     feet.  His hand rests on the yak's back.\n\n     The Indian soldier steps closer and, knowing he is breaking\n     protocol, he whispers:\n\n                                      SOLDIER\n                            With all respect, may I ask?\n                            Who are you?\n\n     The young man smiles at the Soldier - a man who looks like\n     the lead soldier come alive.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            What you see before you is\n                            a man.  A simple monk.\n\n                                      SOLDIER\n                            Are you the Lord Buddha?\n\n     Pause.\n\n                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n                            I think I am a reflection,\n                            like the moon, on water.\n                            When you see me, and I try\n                            to be a good man, see\n                            yourself\n\n     INT.  A ROOM IN INDIA, FOOT OF THE HIMALAYAS  DAY\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso unpacks.  He is dressed in maroon robes, his\n     arms bare.\n\n     He places some books on a table next to his tinkering\n     equipment.  He lifts a heavy parcel.\n\n     EXT.  TERRACE  DAY\n\n     CLOSE on the young man's beautiful hands as he sets up his\n     telescope.\n\n     The tripod is erect.  The body is attached. The eyepiece is\n     adjusted.\n\n     And then, this boy, this man, this simple monk, aims, to\n     takes a look, at a bigger world.\n\n\n\n     On a black screen, a card reads:\n\n                            The Dalai Lama has not yet\n                            returned to Tibet.\n\n                            He hopes one day to make the journey.\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKundun\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Melissa Mathison\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:50.991438"}
