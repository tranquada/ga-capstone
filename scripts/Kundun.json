The still photograph of this barren\n     mountain range comes to life as we see something moving.\n\n     It is a small caravan - traveling this narrow mountain pass.\n\n<b>                                      WOMAN (VO)\n</b>                            At dawn, you were born.\n\n     CLOSER on this caravan.  We can make out eight or ten men,\n     walking, and on horseback, dressed in heavy, brocade coats,\n     and large woolen hats, black braids trailing down their\n     backs.  A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks,\n     wearing maroon robes.\n\n     The caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns -\n     a sudden shift in direction - a switchback.  The travelers\n     head downhill.\n\n<b>                                      BOY (VO)\n</b>                            Tell me.\n\n     Now, we see the mens's destination.  A lake.  An incredibly\n     blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains.  It\n     is LHAMO I' LATSO - \"the Oracle Lake\" - and it shimmers in\n     the sunlight.\n\n     As the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the\n     curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it.\n\n     The man is dressed in royal robes.  He is young, twenty four\n     years old.  His name is RETING RINPOCHE.  He is the Regent\n     of Tibet.\n\n     The color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to\n     a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness.\n\n<b>                                      WOMAN (VO)\n</b>                            You were a beautiful baby.\n                            So calm.\n<b>         \n</b><b>                                      BOY (VO)\n</b>                            No cried?\n\n     The woman laughs.\n\n<b>                                      WOMAN (VO)\n</b>                            Maybe, just a little.\n\n     The palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the\n     lake.  The water's color changes again, to a deep purple,\n     then blue again, then red, then indigo.\n\n<b>                                      WOMAN (VO)\n</b>                            And that day, your father\n                            got better.  He named you Lhamo.\n                            \"The Protector.\"\n\n<b>                                      BOY (VO)\n</b>                            I know.\n\n     Silence.\n\n     The noblemen and monks surround Reting as he steps out of\n     the palanquin.\n\n     One man stands out here, a monk, a high lama in fact, with a\n     kind face and fantastic, mesmerizing eyes.  He is the LAMA\n<b>     OF SERA.\n</b>\n<b>                                      WOMAN (VO)\n</b>                            Go to sleep, Lhamo.\n\n     Reting stares at the lake.\n\n     The water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure\n     at first, then becoming more solid.  A vision.\n\n     He sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house.\n\n     The house has a flat, tile roof and an unusual, wooden rain\n     gutter, with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in\n     the courtyard.  A spotted dog is in front of the house,\n     barking, though we cannot hear him.  The vision becomes\n     completely clear, for an instant - clear enough to see the\n     face of a young boy at the window.\n\n     CLOSE on Reting Rinpoche.  Looking.  Searching.\n\n     Cut to:  a portrait of a mountain:  Kyeri - a majestic,\n     glacier mountain - the \"house mountain\" of the village of\n     Takster, Amdo Province, North Eastern Tibet.\n\n     Sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged,\n     mountain peak and then the view moves down, below the tree\n     line, and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands,\n     until it comes to rest on a small, stone, u-shaped house.  A\n     house caught in the dawn's mist.\n\n     CLOSE on the face of a sleeping child:  a boy, LHAMO\n     DHONDRUP, age two and one-half years.  He is dreaming.  He\n     is about to wake up.\n\n     Today, his life will change.\n\n     We stay on the boy's face until, slowly, his eyes open -\n     beautiful, dark, eyes.\n\n<b>     INT.  TIBETAN PEASANT HOME, KITCHEN   DAWN (1937)\n</b>\n     The MOTHER walks past the boy, her woolen skirt swaying in\n     the rosy light.  A seven year-old brother - LOBSANG SAMTEN -\n     and a teenage sister - TSERING DOLMA - share Lhamo's kitchen\n     mattress.  Lhamo looks at them, and then he turns to see the\n     heavy felt boots of his FATHER, as the man walks through the\n     room and out the door.  Lhamo finds the kind face of his\n     MOTHER.  She is looking at him.\n\n<b>     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN\n</b>\n     The boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the\n     sounds of this country morning:  the snorting of horses,\n     clucking of hens, a command from the Father as the man feeds\n     the animals.\n\n     The boy scratches, he pees.  He sees his Mother on the roof.\n     She is a silhouette against the dawn, as she feeds cedar and\n     yak chips into the incense burner - sending white, curly\n     smoke up, to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of\n     printed mantras.\n\n     We pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark.\n\n     Lhamo's house is the house in the vision.\n\n<b>     INT.  KITCHEN  MORNING\n</b>\n     It is a good day.  There is cheese for breakfast.\n\n     Lhamo's Father sits on a cushion at the head of a low table.\n     Fresh bread appears, yogurt, roasted barley (tsampa).\n\n     Lhamo pushes at his Father.\n\n<b>                                      LHAMO\n</b>                            Me.\n\n<b>                                      FATHER\n</b>                            No.  This must stop.\n\n<b>                                      LHAMO\n</b>                            Me.

He bestows a most beautiful smile on his family.\n\n<b>     EXT.  COURTYARD  DAY\n</b>\n     The Father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses\n     when there is a sudden commotion.\n\n     The CHINESE GOVERNOR is passing through this little village.\n\n     He is a ferocious looking man, dressed in ornate brocade,\n     his horse eguipped with tack that looks like armor.  He is\n     surrounded by a dozen Chinese soldiers, all on huge horses,\n     ruling the road, kicking up mud.\n\n     Lhamo's Father stops.  He holds still.  He looks to the\n     house.\n\n     The Mother is holding the children against her in the\n     doorway.  Quiet.  Watching.\n\n     The Governor and his entourage move on.  When they are out\n     of sight, Lhamo's Father makes his departure.\n\n<b>     EXT.

The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them -\n     he knows the game.\n\n     We recognize this servant.  His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE.\n     He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one\n     with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of\n     Sera Monastery.\n\n     Lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and\n     immediately pulls at the string of beads.\n\n<b>                                      LHAMO\n</b>                            Mine.\n\n     The Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy.\n     Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck.

The road\n                            would lead directly to China.\n\n     The Layman gets to his knees.\n\n<b>                                      LAYMAN\n</b>                            We cannot allow it.\n                            Right now, we have a only a small\n                            Chinese mission in Lhasa, the first\n                            since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama\n                            threw them out in 1912.\n                            The road would increase the size of\n                            that mission. The Chinese would\n                            try to control our trade, as they did\n                            once before, control our contact\n                            with the outside world.\n\n<b>     INT.  HALLWAY  DAY\n</b>\n     The Lord Chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and Tenzin\n     Gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades\n     away.\n\n     As the two walk down the hallway, Tenzin Gyatso spots an\n     unusual wooden door.  He lets the Lord Chamberlain get a\n     little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door.\n     It is heavy.  It almost opens.\n\n<b>     INT.  HALLWAY  LATER, DUSK\n</b>\n     Tenzin Gyatso and his brother Lobsang are pulling at the\n     heavy door.  Behind them, in the distance, we hear:\n\n<b>                                      MONKS (OC)\n</b>                            Kundun!  Kundun!\n\n     The door opens.  The boys disappear inside.\n\n<b>     INT.  STORAGE ROOM  DUSK\n</b>\n     A treasure awaits them.\n\n     It looks like Aladdin's cave - full of odd, European items.\n\n     There are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded\n     mirror, a lacquered rocking horse.  There are hats,\n     umbrellas and even a pair of lace-up, cordovan shoes.\n     Tenzin Gyatso lifts a reel of film.  There are piles of\n     magazines and books.  There is a stack of tires in the back\n     corner.  The boys uncover a train set and a good collection\n     of lead soldiers.  The Dalai Lama pockets a gold watch.\n\n     Just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them\n     at the door, Tenzin sees something truly spectacular.  It is\n     a telescope.\n\n     The monks enter the room as the young Dalai Lama reaches for\n     this miracle.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            What is it?\n\n<b>                                      THE ATTENDANTS\n</b>                            Ah, it is a telescope, Holiness.\n                            With this you can see a long way.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            And, is it mine?\n\n<b>                                      ATTENDANT\n</b>                            These are all gifts sent to\n                            your predecessors.\n\n<b>                                      LOBSANG SAMTEN\n</b>                            Yes!

DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT\n</b>\n     We are in the adjacent room, listening, as Norbu Thundrup\n     tells a bedtime story.\n\n     Golden butter lamps burn before a statue of Buddha.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP (OC)\n</b>                            One night, not too long\n                            ago, an old monk saw a woman in that\n                            very same hallway where you ran away.\n\n<b>     INT.  BEDROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\n     The boy is in bed.  The Sweeper finishes-off his story as\n     the boy wiggles deeper under the covers.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            She carried a basket in\n                            her arms, a big, heavy basket, and\n                            the old monk cautiously approached.\n                            She opened her basket and showed what\n                            she had.

Only\n                            the heads.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            Is that true or pretend?\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            It is a story, you decide.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            Pretend.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            As you say.\n\n     The Sweeper tucks the boy in as the Master of the Robe\n     finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a\n     smile, the two men leave the room.\n\n     A mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on\n     the altar before the Buddha.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to\n     see if those curly-toed shoes are visible under the\n     partition.  They are.  The Master of the Kitchen is still\n     near.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the\n     covers.  He pries and digs at the back of the watch until he\n     succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous\n     insides.\n\n     Finally, Tenzin Gyatso's eyelids grow heavy.  The camera\n     passes over his face, as his eyes close.\n\n     The boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep:\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            \"I be an island for those who\n                            seek one, a lamp for light.\"\n\n     We find two scrolls;  the first is PENDEN LHAMO, the special\n     protectress of the Dalai Lama.\n\n     She rides her wild mule through a sea of blood - between\n     rows of jagged mountains.  Pointed fingers and spreading\n     toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed - the details\n     are incredible.  A garland of freshly severed heads hangs\n     around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form\n     ber crown.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO (VO)\n</b>                            \"May I be a bed for all who wish\n                            to rest,\n                            and a slave for all who want a\n                            slave.\"\n\n     Beside her, on the second scroll is MAHAKALA.  He is the\n     fierce representation of the Buddha of Compassion.  Crows\n     fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six-\n     armed figure.\n\n     A skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a Trident is\n     held in the left hand.  The deity wears a crown of five\n     skulls.  He has three eyes.  He tramples an elephant.\n\n     We might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves\n     back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young Dalai\n     Lama.  Asleep.\n\n     The camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of\n     the Fifth Dalai Lama.  It is a fantasy of green, with\n     mountains and lakes and deities and monsters.\n\n     We find the statue of Seventh Dalai Lama, sitting on his\n     golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the\n     Thirteenth Dalai Lama.  Fantastic.  Deeper.  Deeper.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            \"May I be wishing jewel, a magic\n                            vase...\n\n<b>     VIEW THROUGH AN EYEPIECE\n</b>\n     We see the Dalai Lama place his young eye at the viewfinder.\n\n<b>     EXT.  TERRACE, POTALA  DAY\n</b>\n     Norbu Thundrup holds the boy steady.\n\n     And, a wondorous view of Lhasa is presented.\n\n     Vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing\n     turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols.  Animals are\n     herded through town by young boys.  Children play and\n     squabble.  A white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons -\n     political posters - picturing the Regent, perhaps, as a man\n     holding too much power.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I want to go down there.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            You can only go with attendants and a\n                            big ceremony.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I want to run down the street.\n                            I want to buy a toy.  Eat from\n                            the shops.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            You cannot.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I want to be a shepherd, taking those\n                            goats and cows out to the hillside.\n\n<b>                                      NORBU THUNDRUP\n</b>                            But you are not a shepherd, you are\n                            the Dalai Lama.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            Maybe in the next life, the\n                            world will not need a Dalai Lama.\n\n                                      NORNU ThUNDRUP\n                            I would not know.  Maybe.\n\n     The view travels and we see a prison yard.  Shackled men\n     share the yard with hairy, fat dogs.\n\n     One man looks up and sees that the yard is under\n     surveillance.  Of course the men all know that this terrace\n     belongs to the boy Dalai Lama.\n\n     As the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another\n     prostrates.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso pulls away from the telescope.  He waves to\n     the prisoners.\n\n<b>     EXT.  VALLEY OUTSIDE LHASA  DAY  (SUMMER, 1942)\n</b>\n     The boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk.\n\n     He is older now, seven or eight.  He peers through the\n     curtain.\n\n     A grand procession carries the Dalai Lama from the Potala to\n     his summer residence, the Norbulinka.\n\n     Monks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy,\n     wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest\n     parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms.  There are\n     horses, banners and carriages.  Bodyguards carry the Dalai\n     Lama's possessions - wrapped in yellow silk.  A band plays,\n     \"God Save the King.\"\n\n     It is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road,\n     Tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to\n     look at him.\n\n<b>     EXT.  THE NORBULINKA  DAY\n</b>\n     Establishing shot of this lovely park.\n\n     Zt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming\n     expansiveness of the Potala.  It is filled with deer and\n     antelope, peacocks and nesting birds.  An eccentric\n     collection of trees grow here - some indigenous, some\n     gifts - bearing flowers and fruit.  There are fish ponds and\n     even a Kyichu river tributary nearby.\n\n     We find the young Dalai Lama standing by this tributary\n     daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone.  An\n     Attendant gently pulls him back.\n\n     Beyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying\n     sheep towards town.  The boy watches.  He listens to the\n     herder's song.\n\n<b>     EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY\n</b>\n     The Dalai Lama drops bits of food into a fish pond.  He\n     calls the huge, lazy fish to come eat.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            Little ones first, only\n                            little ones.\n\n     The boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick.\n\n<b>     EXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  DAY\n</b>\n     Tenzin Gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow\n     wall (which separates the Dalai Lama's residence from the\n     rest of the Norbulinka), and up the steps leading to a\n     white, one story, home - his parent's.\n\n<b>     INT.  PARENT'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY\n</b>\n     A startling, blue room.\n\n     The young Dalai Lama leans on the table where is Father sits\n     eating pork rinds.\n\n     Lobsang is there, practicing his writing on a chalk board.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso grabs one pork rind, then another, then a\n     third.\n\n<b>                                      LOBSANG SAMTEN\n</b>                            The Dalai Lama is not supposed\n                            to eat pork.  It is not good for\n                            your brain.\n\n     The Father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the\n     table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a\n     point.\n\n     The Dalai Lama takes another, and then, suddenly, the boy\n     reaches up and for no reason, he pulls on his Father's\n     mustache, obviously hurting the man.  The Father slaps the\n     boy's hand, hard.\n\n     The boy sits back, and begins drawing imaginary letters on\n     the tabletop with his slapped hand.\n\n     His Father reaches out and takes the hurt hand.  He pulls\n     the boy into his arms.\n\n<b>                                      FATHER\n</b>                            I am sorry, Lhamo.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            It is alright, Father.\n\n     The Master of the Robe knocks at the door.

The Dalai\n     Lama is in disguise.  He is wearing the clothes of a Khamba\n     guerrilla - dark, woolen chuba and tall black boots.\n\n     Monks sit on the floor, chanting.  One monk stands by a\n     large urn, ladling out butter for the lamps.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso goes to the front of the room.\n\n     A monk begins to play the cymbals. Another puts the\n     Tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long, mournful note.\n\n     The Dalai Lama lays a white silk scarf - a kata - over the\n     shoulders of this imposing statue.\n\n     Then, he sits for a moment.\n\n     In the weak light, in the black room, Tenzin Gyatso is lost\n     among the other praying monks.\n\n<b>     EXT.

He tucks\n     the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the\n     scarf.  He places the bundle in the drawer.\n\n     Then, he adds something.  A sweet.  The kind his Mother\n     makes.\n\n     He closes the drawer, and locks it.\n\n     He hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive\n     cabinet.\n\n<b>     EXT.

The\n     Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed.\n\n<b>     EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT\n</b>\n     Coracles await.\n\n     The Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside\n     him.  The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on\n     the bank, alone.\n\n     Every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso looks back.  He puts on his glasses.\n\n     He sees camp fires and the glow of torches.  He hears echoed\n     voices.\n\n     He looks up.  He sees the stars and the moon and that\n     incomparable Tibetan sky.\n\n     He looks forward.\n\n     He sees mountains.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I have always loved mountains.\n\n     He is handed a steaming cup of tea.\n\n     And then, a cloud passes over the moon.\n\n<b>     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT\n</b>\n     On horse back, the party makes its way up a mountain pass.\n\n     There are more members now - Tenzin Gyatso has joined those\n     who left ahead of him - members of the Kashag, tutors, his\n     Mother, his Brother.\n\n     It is tough going.  The ground seems like quick sand with\n     every step a struggle.  When the horses have disappeared\n     from sight, a sand storm arises, wiping away their tracks.\n\n<b>     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT\n</b>\n     The party passes above an encampment of Chinese soldiers.\n     They are not seen.\n\n<b>     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  DAY\n</b>\n     The party travels through the emptiness.\n\n<b>     EXT.  MOUNTAIN PASS  DUSK\n</b>\n     His Holiness walks beside his horse.\n\n     He joins other members of the group standing on a ridge.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            \"Right will be victorious.\"\n\n     And now, the others do the same.  The Lord Chamberlain says:\n\n<b>                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN\n</b>                            \"The Gods will be avenged!\"\n\n<b>     EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF TIBET  DAY\n</b>\n     The Dalai Lama sits before a low table set up on this\n     desolate border.\n\n     A document is before him.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I repudiate the Seventeen Point\n                            Agreement\n\n     With a slap of the State Seal of Tibet, this is done.\n\n     The Lord Chamberlain removes this document and replaces it\n     with another.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I constitute the Government\n                            of Tibet, the only legal\n                            authority in the land.\n\n     The seal comes down hard once more.  It is done.\n\n<b>     EXT.  BORDER  DAY\n</b>\n     A sick and tired Tenzin Gyatso makes the last leg of his\n     trip on the back of a black yak.\n\n     Before him, through the light rain, we see a small bamboo\n     arch erected in the middle of nowhere.  Six Indian GHURKAS,\n     wearing floppy, jungle hats and heavy, British boots, stand\n     at attention.\n\n     The Dalai Lama, on his black yak, passes under this babboo\n     gateway as the Indian Soldiers raise their guns in salute.\n\n     An Indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man\n     from his mount.\n\n     Tenzin Gyatso stands, barely able to hold himself on his\n     feet.  His hand rests on the yak's back.\n\n     The Indian soldier steps closer and, knowing he is breaking\n     protocol, he whispers:\n\n<b>                                      SOLDIER\n</b>                            With all respect, may I ask?\n                            Who are you?\n\n     The young man smiles at the Soldier - a man who looks like\n     the lead soldier come alive.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            What you see before you is\n                            a man.  A simple monk.\n\n<b>                                      SOLDIER\n</b>                            Are you the Lord Buddha?\n\n     Pause.\n\n<b>                                      TENZIN GYATSO\n</b>                            I think I am a reflection,\n                            like the moon, on water.\n                            When you see me, and I try\n                            to be a good man, see\n                            yourself\n\n<b>     INT.  A ROOM IN INDIA, FOOT OF THE HIMALAYAS  DAY\n</b>\n     Tenzin Gyatso unpacks.  He is dressed in maroon robes, his\n     arms bare.\n\n     He places some books on a table next to his tinkering\n     equipment.  He lifts a heavy parcel.\n\n<b>     EXT.  TERRACE  DAY\n</b>\n     CLOSE on the young man's beautiful hands as he sets up his\n     telescope.\n\n     The tripod is erect.  The body is attached. The eyepiece is\n     adjusted.\n\n     And then, this boy, this man, this simple monk, aims, to\n     takes a look, at a bigger world.\n\n\n\n     On a black screen, a card reads:\n\n                            The Dalai Lama has not yet\n                            returned to Tibet.\n\n                            He hopes one day to make the journey.\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Kundun</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Melissa Mathison\" title=\"Scripts by Melissa Mathison\">Melissa Mathison</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Kundun Script.html#comments\" title=\"Kundun comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:09:19.924134"}
