This is a fairly rundown beach\n        area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and\n        strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or\n        sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger\n        stand.

Seated on\n        the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early\n        thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding\n        idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats\n        lovingly.

He plugs the stethoscope in his ears, removes\nmiscellaneous file folders filled with papers, closes the bag,\nand heads for Pathology.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">57 INT PATHOLOGY\nDEPARTMENT - DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">It's at the end of a\nlong hall, and adjacent to the Autopsy Room and the Pathology\nRecords Room. Over his shoulder we can see into the autopsy room\nwhere a gowned doctor is happily performing an autopsy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(to Fletch)\nIdentification please.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hastily\nfumbles through his wallet, deftly dropping and picking up the\npapers he has brought with him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take\nanother peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have \nthey done with this place?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(confused at all his activity)\nNothing. They're still there.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight. Fine.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Still dropping and\npicking up, shuffling and collating, Fletch starts toward the\nFiles Room, when the doctor performing the autopsy yells at him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nHey you!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch stiffens and\nturns around.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nGive me a hand for a second would you doctor?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hesitates.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nCome on, come on.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Reluctantly, he goes\nto the autopsy table, and the cadaver thereon, which is covered\nby a sheet, except for the mid-section.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">58 TWO SHOT -\nFLETCH AND PATHOLOGIST</p>\n<p align=\"left\">(Note: from here on\nwe never see the body.)</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\n(poking around)\nHave you ever see a spleen this large?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(trying not to look)\nNot recently.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nGrab this, will you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nUh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nYou're not going to make this guy any sicker.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">We hear a squishing\nnoise as he grabs something large and wet and plops it into\nFletch's hand. Fletch stands there holding something icky out of\nframe, looking uncomfortably up at the ceiling, the floor,\nanywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff in his hand.\nMeanwhile, we hear sounds of further incisions, and the deflating\nof an organ.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nYou never really get used to the smell, do you?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch's eyes roll\nup, and he falls to the floor in a dead faint.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">59 INT.

Heh Heh, just kidding.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nDoctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. \nHe was quite surprised that you fainted.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWell, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought\nthe dead man was my brother.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nOh my God!</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's all right. It wasn't him but\nthat spleen was a splitting image.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He sits up and sees\nthat just outside the glass is none other that Dr. Joseph Dolen,\ntalking with the pathologist.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate.\nHave you got a paper bag, or something.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nYes, right away.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">She goes to get the\npaper bag, and Fletch turns his back on Dr. Dolen to go through\nthe file cabinet. By the time the Nurse returns, he's got\nStanwyk's file.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nHere you are, Doctor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThank you.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He puts the bag over\nhis mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation\nwith her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g.\nlooking over, but does not come into the records room or question\nwhat's happening).</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nIs there anything particular you're looking for?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMy associates did a biopsy on this man recently.\n(thumbs through file)\nHe's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma,\nsome kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record\nof it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(taking the file)\nWell, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.\n(searches)\nWait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles.\nTissue was benign.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat's it?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(shows him the file)\nThat's it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(reading it)\nThis was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nI guess not.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(very puzzled)\nHe'll be so relieved.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">60 EXT.

FLETCH'S\nAPARTMENT - DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch climbs in\nthrough the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is\njust barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the\nwall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOne on one?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Gillett shakes his\nhead. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic\nglobe lamb crashing to the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAnd the foul.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch takes a\nsecond, successful shot.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(still playing b-ball)\nShe doesn't need the money, for crissakes. \nShe's living with Monty. I know it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nI don't know what you're referring to. \nWendy maintains her own residence.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt stinks.

I just hate this.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nI empathize with your plight, Fletch. However,\nyou threw her out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nShe was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV\nguy. You can't get lower than that....</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou should have proved that in a court of law.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMy lawyer was a bum.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\n(smiles)\nI agree.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch puts down the\nbasketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou may be right.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAre you serious?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\n(shrugs)\nThat's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred\nand eighteen dollars.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWait a minute! Our problems might be solved.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch holds up an\nenvelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nI think I just won a million dollars!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He opens it and looks\ninside, feigning disappointment.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nDamn...lost again. Sorry.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nThis is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made,\nwe're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch sighs, takes\nout the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand\ndollars to Gillett.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nCash. I'm impressed.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nFound it in a cab. That's a grand.\nApply the difference to next month.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nTill then.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Gillett smiles and\nexits.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">66 KITCHEN - DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch opens the\nfridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip,\na half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a\nbeer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear\nbreakage inside.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">67 MASTER - APARTMENT\n- DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">In a foul mood,\nFletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It\nhas the personality of an Abbey Rents.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He picks up the TV\nremote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with\nJabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThank God.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch settles back.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">68 TELEVISION</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Hearn is gushing over\nJabbar.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">69 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He watches\ncontemplatively.

She is in her late twenties and quite\nattractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we\nsee here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up\nto the entrance of the court.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGail Stanwyk!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">She looks up. He\nenters the court with great delight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nI haven't seen you since the wedding,\nJeez, you look great.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(genuinely pleased)\nI do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess\nsomething to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding.\nI really don't have the faintest idea who you are.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHuh? No, not my wedding. Yours.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nOh, mine! Thank God.\n(furrows her brow)\nActually, that doesn't make it any better, does it?\nAre you a friend of Alan's?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWe used to fly together. I'm...John.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(snaps her fingers in happy recognition)\nJohn! You used to fly together!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Her smile segues\nright into an \"I'm sorry, bit I give up\" expression.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nJohn who?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nJohn Ultrarelamensky.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(bursts out in laughter)\nOh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's Scotch-Rumanian.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(still loading tennis balls)\nThat's a strange combination.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSo were my parents.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nMind if I keep practicing? I need to work\non my ground stroke a little.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nPlease.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">As Mrs. Stanwyk\ncrosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nExcuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYes, I'm with the Underhills.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nThey just left, sir.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThey'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nWould you care for a drink while you're waiting?\nI can put it on the Underhill bill.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGreat. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nVery good sir.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Waiter leaves,\nand Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving\nmachine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get\nthe racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in\nher life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a\ntennis ball in this century.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nDamn, I thought I had that one.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nWhat are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him.\nAnd he's been so preoccupied.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nPreoccupied with what?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nOh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Indeed, she has.\nStrait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's\nflight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGood. Lobs are a very important part of the game.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">She completely misses\nthe next one.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhy do you keep doing this?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nI love the outfits.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">The next one she\nhits with the handle.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nTry stepping into the ball with your left foot.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He demonstrates a\nswing. She puts on a determined face, makes an awkward step and\nswings at the next ball, missing it completely, and letting the\nracket fly.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThere, much better.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Mrs. Stanwyk laughs\nhappily and dodges the machine-served balls to walk over to\nFletch. When she's almost up to him, she turns back to the\nserving machine and points a finger at it, as if addressing a pet\ndog.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nStay!\n(to Fletch)\nI must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI have this effect on lots of women.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nI bet you do.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSay, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into\nhim this morning and you know what I can't figure out?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\n(catching him in his lie)\nAlan's in Utah.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(after a beat)\nI can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nOkay.

How'd you guess?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nIf I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies\nwho tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou are a rich woman.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nSee what I mean?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">She trots back to her\nball machine. Fletch calls after her.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhat's he doing in Utah?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nNone of your business, now go away.\nYou're throwing my game off.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch chuckles -- he\nlikes this woman -- and exits.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">78 BOYD AVIATION -\nDAY - ESTABLISHING</p>\n<p align=\"left\">A sprawling,\nHughes-like complex.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n<b>(O.S.)\n</b>...then who walks in but George Bush. \nHe took one look around the room...</p>\n<p align=\"left\">79 INT.

A lighted sign in the yard\nindicate that this is indeed Swarthout Realty, but the house is\ndark; no one appears to be home. Somewhere in the yard a dog\nbarks viciously, frantically.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">116 DOG</p>\n<p align=\"left\">A killer Doberman is\ntied up behind a chain link fence. At the sight of the intruding\nFletch, the dog's lip is practically over his nose, his fangs are\npoised and gleaming.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">117 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(getting out of his car)\nWhat's your name fella?

He rings the bell. The dog yowls\neven louder. Fletch waits. And waits. He rings again. Satisfied\nthat no one is home, he tries the front door. Of course, it is\nlocked. He takes out a credit card, starts to jimmy the lock, and\nactually seems to be making progress when his credit card snaps\nin half.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSh*t.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He pockets the broken\ncredit card, steps back and looks over the house for another\npossible point of entry.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">120 FLETCH'S POINT OF\nVIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Double-hung. Slightly\nwarped, so that the upper half does not exactly true with the\nlower half.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">121 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">looks around to see\nhow to climb up to it.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">122 MASTER</p>\n<p align=\"left\">There's only one way.\nClimb up the side of the chain link fence which separates him\nfrom the murderous dog. Fletch approaches it warily. The dog is\npractically foaming. Fletch reaches out a hand to get a hold of\nthe fence, and the dog just about rips the fence apart.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(in his best Barbara Woodhouse)\nSit-tuh!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">This has no effect,\nso Fletch backs up a few yards, take a deep breath for courage\nand makes a headlong running start for the fence, using his\nmomentum to get to the top before the dog eats him. He grabs hold\nand scrambles wildly for the top. He makes it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRoll over. Play dead. Good boy.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch now grabs hold\nof the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls\nhimself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the\nvulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and\nthe going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary\neye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and\ncloser to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou any relation to Doctor Dolan?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">Now he's at the\nwindow. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance\nfrom the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't\nbelieve it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window\nwith his elbow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hate this.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He climbs into the\ndarkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around\nthe fenced in yard that surrounds the house.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">123 INT SWARTHOUT'S\nHOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch tiptoes though\nthe upstairs bedroom and down the stairs.

SWARTHOUT'S\nDEN - NIGHT</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch enters and\nlooks around.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The dog is now\noutside the den window.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMake sure nobody comes in, okay?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He goes to the file\ncabinet and opens it.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He flips through the\n\"S\" section. \"Stanwyk\". He pulls it. He\nthumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking\nfor. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">125-A INSERT - DEED -\nCLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Three <u>Thousand</u>\nDollars.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH (O.S.)\nSo much for your three million dollar ranch.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">126 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">takes out a tiny\ndocument camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads\nit fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file\ncabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he\nsnaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">127 WINDOW</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The murderous\nDoberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window,\nsending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room\nto rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">128 MASTER</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch bolts and the\ndog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all\nthe files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and\nruns through it just as the dog slams into it.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">129 INT. KITCHEN</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is now holed\nup in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full\ncourse of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees\nthat he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in\norder to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that\nwould allow the dog to get in.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Looking around\nfrantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming\nof the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props\nunder the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of\nthe door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get\nin, and he makes his break for the window.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He vaults up onto the\ncounter top and is just about to break the window when he sees\nthat the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening\nthe door.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch knows he has\nonly seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door\nof the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the\nsnarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at\nit. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet\nmignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large\nbucket of cranberry sauce on the dog.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSuck on this Cujo!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Then he dumps an\nequally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily\nvision-impaired, Fletch bolts.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">130 EXT. SWARTHOUT\nHOUSE - NIGHT</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch runs as fast\nas humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he\ngoes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his\nhateful face -- is seconds behind and closing.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch makes it to\nhis car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps\nfuriously at the windshield.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch makes it to\nhis car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed\nwindow, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch smiles, waves\nat the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one...\n(starting the car)\nEverything's fine, now...go take a little nap....</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is ready to\npull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window.\nFletch points back to the house.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nLook! Defenseless babies!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The dog turns to look\nand Fletch guns it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat dog is such an A**hole.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">132 EXT. FLETCH'S\nAPARTMENT HOUSE - DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch parks his car\nhalfway up on the curb, steps out carrying a small overnight bag.\nHe is unshaven and looks beat.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">133 INT. APARTMENT\nHOUSE - CORRIDOR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch comes down the\nhall signing \"Billie Jean\" is an excruciating falsetto.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...'</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He opens the door to\nhis apartment and is immediately thrown to the ground.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">134 INT. APARTMENT</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is\nspread-eagled on the floor. Two huge Cops are over him, one\nholding a gun to his head, the other going through his clothes.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP #1\n(feeling the inseam of Fletch's trousers)\nOh, what's this?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIf I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP #1\nFunny boy. Look at this....</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He produces a heroin\nbag.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP#2\nLooks like heroin, Gene.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou just planted that.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Cop #1 kicks Fletch\nin the ribs.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP#2\nWhat'd you say?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRead me my rights.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP #1\nOkay. You have the right to remain silent. You\nhave the right to be kicked in the face by me.\nYou have the rights to have your balls stomped.\nYou have the ---</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHold it!

Chief wants a talk with the boy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SERGEANT\nOh Yeah?\n(smiles at Fletch)\nYou'll like the Chief. Nice man.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SERGEANT\nI find he gets real mellow after he hits somebody a lot.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">137 DOOR TO CHIEF'S\nOFFICE - CHIEF'S OFFICE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The cops open the\ndoor, pull Fletch inside. Chief Cummings, looking like a modern\nexecutive, looks up from his paperwork.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP #1\nHere he is Chief.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">They roughly throw\nFletch into a chair. The Chief -- seemingly oblivious to this\nbrutality -- smiles sincerely.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nEasy fellas.\n(To Fletch friendly)\nBe with you in just a second.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The two Cops leave.\nAs Chief Cummings continues with his paperwork Fletch looks\naround the office, which is decorated tastefully -- no guns on\nthe wall, no American flags. On one wall there is a Matisse, and\non another, various photos of the Chief with local celebrities.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of \nPolice help you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(laughs)\nYou should have seen what <u>she</u> wanted to do \nwith the place.

Probaly\nexplains the curious feeling of love I have for you.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nFor a gentleman who was just found holding a bag\nfull of heroin....</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt was planted on me, sir.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nWe're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that\nwhat you want...Jane Doe?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He suddenly kicks\nFletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYour editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations\nyou're about to print about police involvement in narcotics\ndealing.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch starts to get\nup, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him\nback down.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nI'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't\nneed some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in \nthe way of my men.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n'Your men' might just be involved in all this.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYou idiot. Off the record, deep background:\nI've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Cummings picks Fletch\nup, and holds him by the lapels.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nIf you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just \na little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder.\nAnd if you print your story this week, you might get \nsome of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He throws Fletch\nagainst the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the\nfloor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYou go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll\nmake you regret it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(picks up a picture)\nHey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch takes the\npicture and hurls it across the room. It smashes into the\nopposite wall and shatters.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI don't like Tommy Lasorda.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">138\nand OMITTED\n139</p>\n<p align=\"left\">140 JAIL CORRIDOR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is tossed into\nan empty cell by the two Cops who brought him in. Cummings\nwatches. The two Cops leave, and we see that all the cells in\nthis corridor are empty.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou can't keep me here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nMaybe I'm not going to keep you here.\n(takes out a gun)\nMaybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Chief takes a\nknife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nAfter I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then\nplace it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this\nvery much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of \nminorities that way.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMy God, you're serious.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nAsk anybody.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nCan I ask anybody now?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Cummings looks down\nthe corridor. Deserted.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nCan I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much\nI've always loved her.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(cocks the gun)\nWhat'll it be Fletch?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch looks in\nCummings' eyes. They are steely and cold. He is quite serious.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me.\nBesides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track\nbetting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia,\ndo you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(opening the cell)\nIts been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch walks out of\nthe cell. Cummings walks with him through the empty corridor to\nthe exit.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(very chummy)\nSpeaking of which, you're not going to print\nanything before my investigation is through, are you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nNot a prayer.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nThat a boy.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The emerge into the\nmain hallway of the police station, which is filled with officers\nand civilians. Cummings makes a show of cordially shaking\nFletch's hand as if they were old friends.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nThanks for coming down to see us.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nNot at all, Chief.

NEWSPAPER\nOFFICE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is railing at\nFrank Walker.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHow could you call him?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WALKER\nIt's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting\nboth sides of the story. Something you apparently don't\nknow anything about.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's also called getting me this close to being murdered.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WALKER\nGet out of here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHe threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and \nthreatened to kill me right there if I didn't \npromise to give up the story.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WALKER\nYou know, I've had it up to here with your\nbullsh*t. I need a story from you by tomorrow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou'll have it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WALKER\nBut not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing\ncops, and not horse sh*t paranoid fantasies about\nhomicidal police chiefs.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(exiting)\nThanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WALKER\n(calling after him)\nI want something I can print!</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(giving him the finger)\nPrint this Frank.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Exit Fletch.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">149\nthru OMITTED\n152</p>\n<p align=\"left\">153 EXT.

JAGUAR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk checks his\nwatch, and makes a turn.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">169 MASTER</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk has pulled\ninto a service station. He gets out of his car and opens the\ntrunk.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">170 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He pulls into a\nfast-food joint on the west side of the street. He opens the <u>Sports\nIllustrated</u> and peers over it.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">171 STANWYK</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He takes a gas can\nfrom the trunk, goes to the pump, fills it, and pays the\nattendant in cash.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">172 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Curious.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">173 STANWYK</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He puts the gas can\nback in the trunk, gets into the car, and starts off.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">174 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">follows suit.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">175 SANTA MONICA\nBOULEVARD</p>\n<p align=\"left\">We are getting into\nthe increasingly rundown section of Santa Monica.

He focuses intently.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">178-D FLETCH'S POINT\nOF VIEW - THE OTHER MAN IN THE CAR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">with Stanwyk...is\nPolice Chief Cummings.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">179 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nJesus.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He starts up his car\nand backs out.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">DISSOLVE TO</p>\n<p align=\"left\">180 EXT.

Terrific.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch cuts through\nthe parking lot of a drug store/dry cleaning complex. The cop\ncars follow suit. Shopping wagons are tossed about. He turns a\ncorner and realizes he has a few seconds before they're on top of\nhim again. He screeches up next to a teenager in a sports car.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAll right, fella, smog check. Move over.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Before the guy can\nsay \"who?\", Fletch is in the guy's driver seat and\ntears out, hell bent for leather.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">187 ENTRANCE TO\nFREEWAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch peels off onto\nthe Santa Monica Freeway.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">188 FREEWAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hits about\nninety.

He loses the\nmotorcycle cop who goes past the exit. The squad cars are thrown\nbehind a bit, but still chase.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">191 INT. SQUAD CAR</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COP #1\nSh*t!

He's a few seconds ahead of the cops.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOkay, kid. Just stand here with your hands\non the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee.\nHere, take my hat.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch pops his hat\non the kid's head, and runs off.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">192 EXT.

I'm with the hotel catering. Are you\nenjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch looks to the\nkitchen entrance and sees two cops scanning the crowd. One\nsignals to the opposite door.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">198 DOOR</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Four more cops\nconverge, looking for Fletch. Distant sirens indicate even more.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">199 MASTER</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SPEAKER\nAnd now a man who needs no further introduction....</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The police spot\nFletch and start moving forward.

They wait for Fletch to finish and get out of the\nlight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMany of you are probably not aware of Freddie's\nlifelong commitment to honoring a profession that\nfrequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred\nused to forsake a night with his wife and children to\ngo out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent\nAssociation.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">202 POLICE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">look at each other,\nsensing a trick, and start to move in.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">203 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">going for broke.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOur men in blue are with us today, and I think we\nshould all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on \nthe back and a 'howdy' to them.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">204 POLICE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">moving faster, but\nimpeded by the crowd which rises and follows Fletch's suggestion.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">205 FLETCH</p>\n<p align=\"left\">out of the crowd,\nstill encouraging the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhen was the last time you hugged a cop?\nDo it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda.\nDoesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd\ndone it long ago?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">one cop raises his\ngun towards Fletch, but the crowd is too close, too busy. Fletch\nshakes his hand and slugs him so hard on the back that he falls\nover into the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nLet them know how we feel, with a song. For\nevery cop on every beat in every city of this\ngreat nation.\n(singing)\n'For he's a jolly good fellow....'\n(calls out)\nEverybody!\n(sings)\n'For he's a jolly good fellow....'</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The crowd sings along\nthe rest of the verse. Fletch looks back to the kitchen entrance\nat the police who are swallowed in a sea of congratulations and\nsinging. Fletch takes his time strolling out of the kitchen.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">206 INT.

Oh wait, she couldn't work\nin your office, she's not from around here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOh, thanks.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch walks off and\nwe follow him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CLERK\nShe's from Utah.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">207 EXT.

BEDROOM</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch opens the\ncloset. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch\ngets down and looks under the bed.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">VOICE\nWho the hell are you?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">In his surprise,\nFletch bangs his head as he starts up.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">216 REVERSE</p>\n<p align=\"left\">At the door stands a\ngruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls,\nand a hat with earflaps.

He's not the brightest guy in the world,\nand Fletch has already caught on to that.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MAN\nWho are you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nDon Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Man just stares\nat Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his\nfreedom of movement.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhere is she?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MAN\nMoved out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nShe moved out?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Man nods and\ncocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just\nlooks around the room</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MAN\nShe moved out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSo you're saying she moved out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MAN\nThis morning.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThis morning?

Better tie\nyour shoelaces first.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The man looks down at\nhis shoelaces. Fletch kicks the gun out of his hand and runs\nthrough the house.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">218 EXT.

Real fighter.\nYou're in the insurance line, Harry?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MARVIN\nWell, I'm fully covered.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

I'll bet for two murders it's even more so.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat is a lighter, isn't it?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Just then, the French\ndoors swing open, and Chief Cummings enters.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nGreetings, everyone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(dryly)\nThank God, the police.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nWhat the hell are you doing here?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nPut the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk lowers the\ngun.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(to Fletch)\nI thought you had this all figured\nout. Good going 'Irwin.'</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nDon't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(to Cummings)\nI've got it all under control, \nJerry. You can go now.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(laughs)\nUnder control? You idiot. You\ndidn't know who he was?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">During the following\ndialogues, Fletch starts nudging the fireplace's gas lighter jet\nkey with his foot.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nFat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy.\nIt began to occur to me that some things are\nbeginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nI said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position\nshouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go\nhome and I'll call you tomorrow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nWhat, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear\nyou say something about Rio, Alan. You're not \nleaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars\nI staked you for the next load, are you?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk\nover, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of <u>Dynasty.</u></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch and Gail\nactually start to leave, but Cummings draws his gun and fires\nover their heads. They dive for the floor, landing on the side of\nthe fireplace. Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from his pocket.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nJerry, you're simply going to have to trust me.\nI've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy\nand now you're jeopardizing everything.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYour 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on\nthe front page while you're basking in Rio.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n...with your money.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Cummings turns his\nhead momentarily to consider what Fletch has said, and Stanwyk\ntakes advantage of the distraction to go for his gun. But he is\ntoo slow. Cummings shoots once, striking Stanwyk in the chest,\nkilling him instantly.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Gail screams in\nhorror. Cummings turns to Fletch.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nThis one's going to be even more fun.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(striking the Zippo)\nGo ahead. Make my evening.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hurls the\nlighter into the fireplace, causing a great whoosh of flames.\nCummings throws his hands up in front of his face and Fletch\nleaps at him, wrestling him to the ground. Cummings is the\nstronger of the two, and just as he starts to gain dominance over\nFletch, Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet, picks up her husband's\ntennis racket in it's wooden brace, and slams it against\nCummings' head with all her might.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Chief is knocked\nout.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch lies there,\npanting, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at Gail, still\nholding the racket, and staring at Alan's body. Fletch hustles\nher out of the room.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">260-A HALLWAY</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI'm calling the police. Then I'm\nleaving. You wait here for them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nWhere are you going?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAway. I think it might take you a while to get \nyour life back together. You don't need me around.\n(indicates the library)\nDon't go back in there.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He starts to leave.\nShe calls after him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\n(still holding the racket)\nI really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(smiles)\nYou sure did.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch exits.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">DISSOLVE TO</p>\n<p align=\"left\">261 EXT. RIO DE\nJANEIRO - DAY</p>\n<p align=\"left\">With Sugarloaf\nMountain in the b.g., Fletch lies in a lounge chair, sipping an\nexotic drink, watching the cavorting lovelies and playing his\nbattered Casio. This is obviously at some very expensive beach\nclub or hotel, as witnessed by the uniformed servant who brings a\ntelephone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\n(Brazilian accent)\nYour call is come through.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nFar out.\n(to the phone)\nLarry? It's Fletch.\n(pause, looks around)\nWell, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm.\n(pause)\nOh, tell Frank I need a couple of months.\nThe fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He pauses again to\nlisten to Larry, but sees something O.S. that takes over his\nattention. he doesn't wait for Larry to finish what she's saying.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI gotta go, Lar.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He hangs up and\nstands. We see that Gail has just walked up to him. The way they\nlook at each other indicates they have not seen each other for\nawhile, and her arrival is a surprise to Fletch.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nJohn Ultramalensky, right?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nGod, I haven't seen you since the wedding.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nNot mine, stupid. Yours.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(big smile)\nWhat are you doing here?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">They start walking\ndown the beach. We stay right with them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nI couldn't sit home and play the mournful \nwidow anymore, and the police didn't need me,\nso I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, \nbut the announcer talked to fast and I\ncouldn't understand a lot of what was \nhappening, so I figured if I came\ndown here maybe you could explain the\nrules to me, and besides, I missed you.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nNo problem.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He puts his arm\naround her, as we watch them leave us behind and walk off down\nthe beach.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nBasketball, of course, was invented in France,\nand is played with a large ball, two tongue \ndepressors and a fish....</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch ad-libs just\nlike Chevy Chase would as they walk further away down the beach\nuntil we....</p>\n<p align=\"left\">FADE OUT</p>\n<p align=\"center\">THE END</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<b>\n</b>\n<b></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Fletch</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Phil A.
