This is a fairly rundown beach\n        area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and\n        strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or\n        sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger\n        stand. Over the stand is a faded sign: \"FAT\n        SAM\u0092S HAMBURGERS\".\nA simple but haunting\n        electronic melody plays in the b.g.\n\nINT. \"FAT\n        SAM\u0092S\" \u0096 DAY 2Seated just inside the stand on a\n        folding aluminum chair is a chubby man in his late\n        thirties. He\u0092s wearing a stained valor sweat suit\n        and a cap. This is Fat Sam. He\u0092s a dealer. Seated on\n        the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early\n        thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding\n        idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats\n        lovingly. This is the source of the title music.\nFLETCH\nSo what do\n        you figure?\nFAT SAM\nNo idea.\nFLETCH\nNo idea at\n        all?\nFAT SAM\nOkay. Some\n        idea.\nFLETCH\nLike when?\nFAT SAM\nLike\n        tonight.\nFLETCH\nFor sure?\nFAT SAM\nNo, not for\n        sure.

BERMAN STREET\n- DAY\n---The Jaguar continues on up Berman Street,\nstopping before massive iron gates \n---marked PRIVATE PROPERTY -- NO TRESPASSING\n-- STANWYK. The gates open \n---electronically.\n12 EXT. STANWYK HOUSE\n- DAY\n---The jaguar goes up the center of the drive\ntoward a white-pillared mansion. The \n---lawns and planting are spectacular.\n13 INT. JAGUAR - DAY\n---Fletch stares out the window.\nFLETCH\nWhat a coincidence.\n---The car stops before the house.\nSTANWYK\nWhat?\n14 EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n---as they get out of the car.\nFLETCH\nI came this close...\n(holds fingers slightly apart)\n...to buying this place\n---Stanwyk ignores Fletch and starts toward\nthe house. Fletch follows.\nFLETCH\nThen I found out Hopalong Cassidy had\nshot himself in the game room. That\njust blew it for me.\nSTANWYK\nWho?\nFLETCH\nHopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here.\nBow and arrow. Strange.\n---Stanwyk stops before the front door, stares\nat Fletch\nSTANWYK\nWhat are you, doped up or something?\n---Fletch abruptly changes gears, stares at\nStanwyk\nFLETCH\nI don't work for you yet, assface.\nDon't talk to me like that.\nSTANWYK\n(after a beat)\nCome inside.\n15 INT.

Everything built in\nteak. Fletch enters, and Stanwyk closes\n---the door behind them.\nFLETCH\nAhh, the library. Masculine but sensitive.\n---Stanwyk wordlessly goes behind the desk\nFLETCH\nReally, I love what you've done with the place.\nMust have cost you...hundreds.\n---Stanwyk turns, looks out a pair of French\ndoors behind his desk, then turns \n---back.\nSTANWYK\nHere's my proposition, Mr. Fletcher.\nFLETCH\nI'm all ears.\nSTANWYK\nI want you to murder me.\n17\nthru OMITTED\n19\n20 FLETCH\n---Even garrulous Fletch is stopped in his\ntracks by this remark, uttered in the ---most business-like manner.\n21 STANWYK\nSTANWYK\nHere. On Thursday. I'd like you to shoot me dead.\n22 FLETCH\n---He just stares, barely breathing.\n23 STANWYK\nSTANWYK\nThe reason I ask you to do me this service\nis that I am facing a long, painful, and most\ncertain death. You see, I have bone cancer.\nI don't know if you know anything about bone cancer.\n24 FLETCH\n---He shakes his head.\n25 STANWYK\nSTANWYK\nIt doesn't get any worse than that. Just \neats you up, bit by bit.\nFLETCH\n---Finally regains the gift of speech.\nFLETCH\nYou don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.\n27 MASTER\nSTANWYK\nI don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll\nstart getting bad in about a month. After that...\nwell, I'd rather not be around for it.\nFLETCH\nWhy don't you try suicide?\nSTANWYK\nMy company has taken out a very large insurance\npolicy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would \nnullify my insurance. Murder does not.\nFLETCH\nSo why pick me?\nSTANWYK\nYou're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression --\nbeach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. \nI've watched you for a couple weeks.\nFLETCH\nMaybe I'm just on vacation.\nSTANWYK\nNot with the scum you hang out with. I've watched.\nI've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect\nescape plan for you.\nFLETCH\nDid it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?\nSTANWYK\nI've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.\n28 FLETCH\n---He chews his lip.\n29 STANWYK\nSTANWYK\nFifty thousand and a guarantee you won't get caught.\n---Stanwyk searches Fletch's face carefully\nfor a reaction. After several beats....\nFLETCH\nI'm still here.\nSTANWYK\n(turns and goes to the French doors)\nI want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM.\nMy wife will be off to the club for a committee\nmeeting. It's the staff's night off.\n(pushes doors open)\nThese will be open.\n30 FLETCH\nFLETCH\nWouldn't they normally be locked?\n31 MASTER\nSTANWYK\nSometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff \nusually forgets.\nFLETCH\nI have the same problem with my help.\nSTANWYK\n(goes on, unresponsive)\nI will be here in the room, waiting for you.\nThe safe will be open and there will be fifty\nthousand dollars in it. You will be wearing\nrubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?\nFLETCH\nI rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.\nSTANWYK\nIn this drawer....\n---He opens the top drawer of his desk\n32 INSIDE THE DRAWER\n---an enormous .357 Magnum.\n33 MASTER\n---Stanwyk holds up the gun.\n34 FLETCH\nFLETCH\nA .357.\n35 MASTER\nSTANWYK\nVery good. My .357. Use it and no one can\ntrace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.\nFLETCH\nSo it looks like a burglary attempt. You\ncatch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.\nSTANWYK\nPrecisely. Are you a good shot?\nFLETCH\n(looking at the huge gun)\nWhat's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.\nSTANWYK\nGet me on the first shot, if you can.\nFLETCH\nI don't think you'll have to worry about that.\n---A beat. Stanwyk stares at Fletch.\nSTANWYK\nDo you have a passport?\nFLETCH\nSure, all drifters do.\nSTANWYK\nFine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar.\nThe keys will be in the glove compartment.\nFLETCH\nTake it where?\n---Stanwyk starts to write down the\ninformation on a note pad.\nSTANWYK\nLAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will \nbe a ticket waiting for you.\nFLETCH\nWhere am I going?\nSTANWYK\n(hands Fletch the note)\nRio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.\nFLETCH\nThey serve dinner on the flight?\nSTANWYK\nIt'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll \nenjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there\nat least a year, Mr. Fletcher.\nFLETCH\nYou've certainly thought this out, haven't you?\nSTANWYK\nI am not someone who leaves a great deal\nto chance, Mr. Fletcher.\nFLETCH\nYou sure those doors will be open?\nSTANWYK\nYes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport,\nand the aim. I'll take care of everything else.\nFLETCH\nThe gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.\nSTANWYK\nThat's right.\nFLETCH\nYou sure got the hard part.\nSTANWYK\nWhat do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You'll be doing\nme and my family a great service.\n36 FLETCH\n---thinking it over.\n37 STANWYK\nSTANWYK\nWill you kill me?\n38 FLETCH\nFLETCH\nSure.\n39 INT.

I need a favor.\nLARRY\nShoot.\nFLETCH\nDon't say shoot, okay.\nThey pass the office\nof the city editor Frank Walker, fiftyish. Hold on Walker's\noffice.

On the walls are a team portrait of the Lakers, plus a\ncouple of blow-ups of his column. Fletch writes under the name of\nJane Doe. An unused word processor is on his desk, but the\nkeyboard has been moved aside to make room for an old, much-used\nRoyal typewriter.\nHe bounces some waste\npaper off the monitor into a strategically placed waste can. (A\nlot of crumpled papers lie on the floor all around the can.)\nFLETCH\nTwo....\nWALKER\nIrwin....\nFLETCH\nOh, I hate it when he calls me that.\nWALKER\nIrwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the\ngoddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!\nFLETCH\nI will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?\nWALKER\nNo it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow.\nDid you see the ad we ran Sunday?\nFLETCH\nI never read the paper.\nWALKER\n...never reads the paper...\nWalker goes through a\npile of unread newspapers on Fletch's desk, finds the Sunday\npaper.\nFLETCH\nWhat's the spread on the game tonight?\nWALKER\nI don't know.\n(holds up paper)\nLook!\nFLETCH\nLooks great.\n42 INSERT - AD\nA full-page ad.\nNEXT WEEK\nA \"JANE DOE\" SPECIAL REPORT:\nDRUGS ON OUR BEACHES -\nSHAME OF THE CITY\n43 MASTER\nFLETCH\n'Shame of Our City' is so good.\nWALKER\nNow, Irwin, try to follow me.

Over his shoulder we can see into the autopsy room\nwhere a gowned doctor is happily performing an autopsy.\nRECORDS NURSE\n(to Fletch)\nIdentification please.\nFletch hastily\nfumbles through his wallet, deftly dropping and picking up the\npapers he has brought with him.\nFLETCH\nIt's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take\nanother peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have \nthey done with this place?\nRECORDS NURSE\n(confused at all his activity)\nNothing. They're still there.\nFLETCH\nRight. Fine.\nStill dropping and\npicking up, shuffling and collating, Fletch starts toward the\nFiles Room, when the doctor performing the autopsy yells at him.\nPATHOLOGIST\nHey you!\nFletch stiffens and\nturns around.\nPATHOLOGIST\nGive me a hand for a second would you doctor?\nFletch hesitates.\nPATHOLOGIST\nCome on, come on.\nReluctantly, he goes\nto the autopsy table, and the cadaver thereon, which is covered\nby a sheet, except for the mid-section.\n58 TWO SHOT -\nFLETCH AND PATHOLOGIST\n(Note: from here on\nwe never see the body.)\nPATHOLOGIST\n(poking around)\nHave you ever see a spleen this large?\nFLETCH\n(trying not to look)\nNot recently.\nPATHOLOGIST\nGrab this, will you?\nFLETCH\nUh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized.\nPATHOLOGIST\nYou're not going to make this guy any sicker.\nWe hear a squishing\nnoise as he grabs something large and wet and plops it into\nFletch's hand. Fletch stands there holding something icky out of\nframe, looking uncomfortably up at the ceiling, the floor,\nanywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff in his hand.\nMeanwhile, we hear sounds of further incisions, and the deflating\nof an organ.\nPATHOLOGIST\nYou never really get used to the smell, do you?\nFletch's eyes roll\nup, and he falls to the floor in a dead faint.\n59 INT. RECORDS\nROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER\nFletch is on a couch,\nbeginning to regain consciousness. The Records Nurse hovers over\nhim.\nRECORDS NURSE\nAre you all right, Doctor?\nFLETCH\nWhere am I?\nRECORDS NURSE\nYou're in the Records Room.\nFLETCH\nI'm fine.\nRECORDS NURSE\nCan I get you something?\nFLETCH\nHave you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.\nRECORDS NURSE\nDoctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. \nHe was quite surprised that you fainted.\nFLETCH\nWell, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought\nthe dead man was my brother.\nRECORDS NURSE\nOh my God!\nFLETCH\nIt's all right. It wasn't him but\nthat spleen was a splitting image.\nHe sits up and sees\nthat just outside the glass is none other that Dr. Joseph Dolen,\ntalking with the pathologist.\nFLETCH\nOh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate.\nHave you got a paper bag, or something.\nRECORDS NURSE\nYes, right away.\nShe goes to get the\npaper bag, and Fletch turns his back on Dr. Dolen to go through\nthe file cabinet. By the time the Nurse returns, he's got\nStanwyk's file.\nRECORDS NURSE\nHere you are, Doctor.\nFLETCH\nThank you.\nHe puts the bag over\nhis mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation\nwith her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g.\nlooking over, but does not come into the records room or question\nwhat's happening).\nRECORDS NURSE\nIs there anything particular you're looking for?\nFLETCH\nMy associates did a biopsy on this man recently.\n(thumbs through file)\nHe's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma,\nsome kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record\nof it.\nRECORDS NURSE\n(taking the file)\nWell, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.\n(searches)\nWait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles.\nTissue was benign.\nFLETCH\nThat's it?\nRECORDS NURSE\n(shows him the file)\nThat's it.\nFLETCH\n(reading it)\nThis was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.\nRECORDS NURSE\nI guess not.\nFLETCH\n(very puzzled)\nHe'll be so relieved.\n60 EXT. SANTA MONICA\nSTREET - LATE AFTERNOON\nFletch pulls up in\nfront of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex.\nFletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a\nMercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his\nbuilding.\n61 EXT. REAR OF THE\nBUILDING - DAY\nFletch starts\nclimbing up the fire escape of his building.\n62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY\nFletch reaches the\nsecond floor. He's huffing and puffing.\nFLETCH\nChrist.\n63 REVERSE\nAttorney Charles\nGillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape.\nGillett smiles.\nGILLETT\nRefusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.\n64 MASTER\nFLETCH\nWhat about breaking and entering?\n(points to Gillett's coat)\nAre you wearing anything under that?\nGILLETT\nI did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable\nlocation to await my client's delinquent husband.\nFLETCH\nI hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step\ninside.\nFletch takes out a\ncredit card and jimmies open the lock on the window.\n65 INT. FLETCH'S\nAPARTMENT - DAY\nFletch climbs in\nthrough the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is\njust barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the\nwall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett.\nFLETCH\nOne on one?\nGillett shakes his\nhead. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic\nglobe lamb crashing to the floor.\nFLETCH\nAnd the foul.\nFletch takes a\nsecond, successful shot.\nGILLETT\nYou owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.\nFLETCH\n(still playing b-ball)\nShe doesn't need the money, for crissakes. \nShe's living with Monty. I know it.\nGILLETT\nI don't know what you're referring to. \nWendy maintains her own residence.\nFLETCH\nIt stinks. I thought woman were independent now.\nGILLETT\nUntil she remarries, Fletch.\nFLETCH\nHey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.\nGILLETT\nI empathize with your plight, Fletch. However,\nyou threw her out.\nFLETCH\nShe was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV\nguy. You can't get lower than that....\nGILLETT\nYou should have proved that in a court of law.\nFLETCH\nMy lawyer was a bum.\nGILLETT\n(smiles)\nI agree.\nFletch puts down the\nbasketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it.\nFLETCH\nI think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.\nGILLETT\nYou may be right.\nFLETCH\nAre you serious?\nGILLETT\n(shrugs)\nThat's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred\nand eighteen dollars.\nFLETCH\nWait a minute! Our problems might be solved.\nFletch holds up an\nenvelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it.\nFLETCH\n(continuing)\nI think I just won a million dollars!\nHe opens it and looks\ninside, feigning disappointment.\nFLETCH\n(continuing)\nDamn...lost again. Sorry.\nGILLETT\nThis is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made,\nwe're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.\nFletch sighs, takes\nout the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand\ndollars to Gillett.\nGILLETT\nCash. I'm impressed.\nFLETCH\nFound it in a cab. That's a grand.\nApply the difference to next month.\nGILLETT\nTill then.\nGillett smiles and\nexits.\n66 KITCHEN - DAY\nFletch opens the\nfridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip,\na half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a\nbeer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear\nbreakage inside.\n67 MASTER - APARTMENT\n- DAY\nIn a foul mood,\nFletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It\nhas the personality of an Abbey Rents.\nHe picks up the TV\nremote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with\nJabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup.\nFLETCH\nThank God.\nFletch settles back.\n68 TELEVISION\nHearn is gushing over\nJabbar.\n69 FLETCH\nHe watches\ncontemplatively. He is bone tired.\n70 TELIVISION\nHEARN\nHow about Fletch?\nJABBAR\nWell, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong,\nreally clogs the middle for us, boxes out, \ngets the bounds....\n71 FLETCH\nHe smiles and nods,\ndeep in fantasy.\n72 TELEVISION\nHEARN\nNow here's a key play in Tuesday night's game....\nHearn and Jabbar look\ndown at a television monitor.\n73 FLETCH\nHe's half asleep.\nJABBAR (V.O.)\nHere I am dishing off to Fletch....\nFletch raises an\neyebrow.\n74 TELEVISION\nThere's Fletch, his\nhair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end\nof a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup.\nHEARN (V.O.)\nGosh, he makes it look so easy!\n75 FLETCH\nasleep, smiling.\n77 PRICATICE COURT -\nDAY\nGail Stanwyk is on\nthe other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the\nautomatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite\nattractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we\nsee here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up\nto the entrance of the court.\nFLETCH\nGail Stanwyk!\nShe looks up. He\nenters the court with great delight.\nFLETCH\n(continuing)\nI haven't seen you since the wedding,\nJeez, you look great.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(genuinely pleased)\nI do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess\nsomething to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding.\nI really don't have the faintest idea who you are.\nFLETCH\nHuh? No, not my wedding. Yours.\nMRS. STANWYK\nOh, mine! Thank God.\n(furrows her brow)\nActually, that doesn't make it any better, does it?\nAre you a friend of Alan's?\nFLETCH\nWe used to fly together. I'm...John.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(snaps her fingers in happy recognition)\nJohn! You used to fly together!\nHer smile segues\nright into an \"I'm sorry, bit I give up\" expression.\nMRS. STANWYK\nJohn who?\nFLETCH\nJohn Ultrarelamensky.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(bursts out in laughter)\nOh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.\nFLETCH\nIt's Scotch-Rumanian.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(still loading tennis balls)\nThat's a strange combination.\nFLETCH\nSo were my parents.\nMRS. STANWYK\nMind if I keep practicing? I need to work\non my ground stroke a little.\nFLETCH\nPlease.\nAs Mrs. Stanwyk\ncrosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch.\nWAITER\nExcuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?\nFLETCH\nYes, I'm with the Underhills.\nWAITER\nThey just left, sir.\nFLETCH\nThey'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.\nWAITER\nWould you care for a drink while you're waiting?\nI can put it on the Underhill bill.\nFLETCH\nGreat. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.\nWAITER\nVery good sir.\nThe Waiter leaves,\nand Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving\nmachine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get\nthe racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in\nher life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a\ntennis ball in this century.\nMRS. STANWYK\nDamn, I thought I had that one.\nFLETCH\nYou should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?\nMRS. STANWYK\nWhat are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him.\nAnd he's been so preoccupied.\nFLETCH\nPreoccupied with what?\nMRS. STANWYK\nOh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!\nIndeed, she has.\nStrait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's\nflight.\nFLETCH\nGood. Lobs are a very important part of the game.\nShe completely misses\nthe next one.\nFLETCH\nWhy do you keep doing this?\nMRS STANWYK\nI love the outfits.\nThe next one she\nhits with the handle.\nFLETCH\nTry stepping into the ball with your left foot.\nHe demonstrates a\nswing. She puts on a determined face, makes an awkward step and\nswings at the next ball, missing it completely, and letting the\nracket fly.\nFLETCH\nThere, much better.\nMrs. Stanwyk laughs\nhappily and dodges the machine-served balls to walk over to\nFletch. When she's almost up to him, she turns back to the\nserving machine and points a finger at it, as if addressing a pet\ndog.\nMRS STANWYK\nStay!\n(to Fletch)\nI must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.\nFLETCH\nI have this effect on lots of women.\nMRS STANWYK\nI bet you do.\nFLETCH\nSay, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into\nhim this morning and you know what I can't figure out?\nMRS STANWYK\n(catching him in his lie)\nAlan's in Utah.\nFLETCH\n(after a beat)\nI can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.\nMRS STANWYK\nOkay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to,\nand you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but\nI'm also very married so you may as well forget --\nYou are trying to hit on me, aren't you?\nFLETCH\n(thinks, then nods)\nI'm such a heel. How'd you guess?\nMRS STANWYK\nIf I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies\nwho tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.\nFLETCH\nYou are a rich woman.\nMRS STANWYK\nSee what I mean?\nShe trots back to her\nball machine. Fletch calls after her.\nFLETCH\nWhat's he doing in Utah?\nMRS STANWYK\nNone of your business, now go away.\nYou're throwing my game off.\nFletch chuckles -- he\nlikes this woman -- and exits.\n78 BOYD AVIATION -\nDAY - ESTABLISHING\nA sprawling,\nHughes-like complex.\nFLETCH\n(O.S.)\n...then who walks in but George Bush. \nHe took one look around the room...\n79 INT. JOHN BOYD'S\nOFFICE - DAY\nA Secretary is\nserving coffee to Fletch (now dressed in a three piece suit) and\nJohn Boyd, Gail Stanwyk's father. At seventy, he is probably\nChairman Emeritus now; no longer running the day-to-day\noperations of the company, and thus somewhat grateful from the\ncompany.\nFLETCH\n(continuing)\n...and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I \nthought it was Saturday.'\nBoyd Laughs.\nFLETCH\nI thought I was going to die.\nSECRETARY\nSugar, Mr. Poon?\nFLETCH\nThank you.\nFletch notices a\nframed wedding photograph on the credenza behind Boyd. It is of\nAlan and Gail Stanwyk, Alan beaming a $hit-eating grin and\nholding a happy thumbs-up.\nFletch waits as the\nSecretary leaves the room, then begins speaking confidentially.\nFLETCH\nOkay.\nHe opens his attache\ncase, allowing Boyd to see an airline ticket, a Washington\nPost, and a file stenciled \"Confidential/S.E.C. Use\nonly.\"\nFLETCH\nFirst of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a\nformal\ninvestigation. I'm not going through formal channels here,\nbecause\nif Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody\nhas to know I was even ---\nBOYD\nAlan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where\nthe hell does the S.E.C. come off ---\nFletch is nodding\nsympathetically and holds up a quieting hand. Boyd stops in\nmid-tirade, and watches as Fletch reaches into his briefcase and\nseemingly turns off a tape recorder.\nFLETCH\nLook. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking \nfor a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be\nsure.\nAnyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your \nson-in-law are next week's scapegoats.\nBOYD\nUnbelievable.\nFLETCH\nI feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?\nBOYD\nUtah?\n(laughs)\nJesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one \nshare of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch \nin Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her \npersonal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody\nin DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. \nUntil then, get the hell out of my face.\nFLETCH\n(stands and closes briefcase)\nGod I admire you.\nBOYD\nBy the way: what kind of name is Poon?\nFLETCH\nComanche Indian.\n80 ALAN STANWYK'S\nOFFICE - DAY\nFletch breezes in,\nright up to the Secretary, whose nameplate reads MADELINE TURNER.\nFLETCH\n(rapidly)\nOh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number\nof Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to\nme real quick?\nMARGIE\nJim Swarthout?\nFLETCH\nYeah.\nShe writes it out\nfor him.\nMARGIE\nAnd, I'm sorry, who are you again?\nFLETCH\n(grabbing the paper)\nFrieda's boss.\nMARGIE\n(calling after him)\nWho's Frieda?\nFLETCH\n(out the door)\nMy secretary.\n81 EXT. BEACH - DAY\nPan across the\nbeach....\nFLETCH (O.S.)\nLarry, it's me....\nFletch is in a phone\nbooth on the sidewalk next to the beach, keeping an eye on\n\"Fat Sam's.\"\nFLETCH\nSee if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background\nfrom when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor\nin Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy \nabout him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving\nin with me.\nWe hear police\nsirens. Fletch looks O.S.\nFLETCH\nLater.\nHe hangs up.\n82 FLETCH'S POINT OF\nVIEW - FOUR SQUAD CARS\nhave pulled up to the\nbeach, lights flashing. The druggies are dispersing. Creasy is\nrunning towards Fletch.\nCREASY\nFletch! Take off!\n83 FLETCH\nHe steps out onto the\nbeach, and starts towards the cops.\n84 MASTER\nCREASY\nWhat are you doing?\n85 MASTER\nEveryone is\nscattering. The cops run past everyone, and approach Gummey.\n86 FLETCH AND CREASY\nFLETCH\nThey're after Gummy again. It's weird.\nFletch keeps moving\ntoward the police.\nCREASY\n(out of breath)\nFletch, slow down.\n87 GUMMY AND THE COPS\nGummy trips and falls\nin the sand. A Cop kicks him in the head.\nCOP #1\nLet's go, Gummy.\n88 FLETCH AND CREASY\nstill running toward\nthe cops.\nFLETCH\nHey, what are you doing?\nCREASY\nFletch, this is dumb.\nFLETCH\nYou don't have to run with me, Crease.\n89 MASTER\nThe cops drag Gummy\ntoward a squad car.\n90 ANGLE - \"FAT\nSAM'S\"\nFat Sam peers out,\nwatching the action.\n91 MASTER\nFletch approaches the\ncops.\nFLETCH\nWhy are you beating up on that kid?\nNo responce from the\ncops.\nFLETCH\nHe's defenseless, and you kick the crap out of him.\nWhat do you want from ---\nOne of the cops turns\nand, in one smooth motion, kicks Fletch in the balls. Fletch\nsinks to the ground.\n92 SQUAD CAR\nGummy is packed into\nthe squad car.\n93 FLETCH\nHe rises slowly from\nthe sand. He is in great pain. He starts after the cops again.\n94 CREASY\nCREASY\nFletch!\n95 MASTER\nFLETCH\nWhat goddamn right do you have to take him?\nThe cop car starts\noff. Fletch picks up a rock, hurls it at the cop car. It smashes\nthe rear window.\n96 CREASY\nCREASY\nFletch!!!\n97 MASTER\nThe cop cars go off.\nFletch bends over. He's hurting. Creasy comes over to him.\nCREASY\nHey you're really nuts.\nFLETCH\n(breathless)\nThey didn't do anything.\nCREASY\nWhat? What are you talking about?\nFLETCH\nI busted their window, they didn't do anything.\nCREASY\nYou're lucky.\nFLETCH\nNot luck. They don't want me.\n98 POLICE CARS\nIn a caravan, they\nhead down the highway.\n99 FLETCH\nHe turns and looks\ntowards \"Fat Sam's.\"\n100 \"FAT\nSAM'S\"\nFat Sam watches the\npolice cars go down the road, then turns and looks towards the\nocean. He pulls his Angels cap down over his head.\n101 CLOSE - FLETCH\nHe is focusing on\nsomething, but has not figured it out yet.\nFLETCH\nGummy and two cops....\n102\nand OMITTED\n103\n104 INT. FRANK\nWALKER'S OFFICE - DAY\nFLETCH\nCool your tool, Frank, I need a little\nmore time. I think I'm really on to something here.\nWALKER\nYour onto something. That's good. What?\nFLETCH\nI really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank.\nWhy don't you read it tomorrow?\nLarry, knocks on the\ndoor.\nWALKER\nWhat do you want?\nLarry points to\nFletch.\nWALKER\nSpeak, don't point!\nLARRY\nI need Fletch for a second.\nFLETCH\nShe needs me, Frank.\nFletch turns to\nLarry. Push to two shot.\nLARRY\nNothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout.\nBut I did ---\nFLETCH\nThat's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back\nburner for a while.\nLarry starts to exit.\nWALKER\nJust give me a hint, all right?\nFLETCH\nAll right. Maybe there are some crooked\ncops involved in all this.\nLARRY\n(stopping in the doorway)\nDid you say cops?\nFLETCH\nYeah.\nLARRY\nThat's one thing I did find. It's from\nLast month, so it was in the unsorted pile.\nShe hands Fletch a\nclipping.\n105 INSERT - CLIPPING\nIt is an article and\nphotograph of the newly-appointed citizens on the Police Advisory\nBoard. One of them is Alan Stanwyk.\nWALKER\nWhat's that?\n106 MASTER\nFletch pockets the\nphoto.\nFLETCH\n(puzzled)\nMore cops.\n(then)\nI think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.\nWALKER\nUtah?\nFLETCH\nYeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada.\nI'm sure you've seen pictures.\nWALKER\nWhat about finding the source?\nFLETCH\nI have some ideas.\nWALKER\nWho? Donnie and Marie?\nFLETCH\nVery possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy\nyou a shirt.\nWALKER\nGo to transportation, get a ticket.\nLARRY\n(to Fletch as he exits)\nMy hero.\nFLETCH\nNothing to it.\n107 EXT.

FAIRMONT -\nFLETCH\nwearing a polyester\nbrown suit -- fiddles with the radio. Snatches of programs are\nheard: \"easy listening\" music; country-and-western; a\nrevival show; a call in show -- \"Hi, you're on the\nair.\" \"Hello, Bob, I'd like to discuss the death\npenalty. As you know, Jesus was in favor of it --\" Fletch\nwhistles and switches the radio off. He turns the car off the\ninterstate.\n108 EXT. TRAVELODGE -\nLATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING SHOT\nas Fletch drives up.\n109 INT. TRAVELODGE\nMOTEL ROOM\nFletch dials the\nphone in the small, sparsely furnished room.\nFLETCH\nHi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name\nis Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property.\n110 INT. SWARTHOUT\nREALTY\nJim Swarthout is a\nrugged-looking man in his forties. He sits in the den/office of\nhis house talking on the phone, surrounded by pine-paneling,\nproperty tract maps and wall-mounted animal heads.\nSWARTHOUT\nGood, Mr. Starinski, what'd you have in mind?\n(pause)\nUh huh. Oh are you a friend of Alan's?\n111 INT. FLETCH'S\nMOTEL ROOM\nFLETCH\nNo, I just heard some people at the club talking about the\nproperty\nyou sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded\nlike\na pretty good price.\n(pause)\nWhat?\nFletch pauses again\nto listen, flummoxed over what he has just heard.\nFLETCH\nAre you sure?\n(pause)\nOf course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen,\nI'd love to come out and see you anyway.\nWhen are you available?\n112 INT. SWARTHOUT\nREALTY\nSWARTHOUT\nWell, I'm about to close up shop and go out for the\nevening. How about first thing in the AM?\n(pause)\nGreat. See you tomorrow.\n113 INT. FLETCH'S\nMOTEL ROOM\nFLETCH\nTomorrow.\nFletch hangs up, very\ninterested.\n114 OMITTED\n115 EXT. SWARTHOUT\nREALTY - NIGHT\nFletch stops his car\nin front of the ranch-style house. A lighted sign in the yard\nindicate that this is indeed Swarthout Realty, but the house is\ndark; no one appears to be home. Somewhere in the yard a dog\nbarks viciously, frantically.\n116 DOG\nA killer Doberman is\ntied up behind a chain link fence. At the sight of the intruding\nFletch, the dog's lip is practically over his nose, his fangs are\npoised and gleaming.\n117 FLETCH\nFLETCH\n(getting out of his car)\nWhat's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom?\n118 DOG\ncompletely bananas.\n119 FLETCH\nFletch reaches the\nfront door and looks around. He rings the bell. The dog yowls\neven louder. Fletch waits. And waits. He rings again. Satisfied\nthat no one is home, he tries the front door. Of course, it is\nlocked. He takes out a credit card, starts to jimmy the lock, and\nactually seems to be making progress when his credit card snaps\nin half.\nFLETCH\nSh*t.\nHe pockets the broken\ncredit card, steps back and looks over the house for another\npossible point of entry.\n120 FLETCH'S POINT OF\nVIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW\nDouble-hung. Slightly\nwarped, so that the upper half does not exactly true with the\nlower half.\n121 FLETCH\nlooks around to see\nhow to climb up to it.\n122 MASTER\nThere's only one way.\nClimb up the side of the chain link fence which separates him\nfrom the murderous dog. Fletch approaches it warily. The dog is\npractically foaming. Fletch reaches out a hand to get a hold of\nthe fence, and the dog just about rips the fence apart.\nFLETCH\n(in his best Barbara Woodhouse)\nSit-tuh!\nThis has no effect,\nso Fletch backs up a few yards, take a deep breath for courage\nand makes a headlong running start for the fence, using his\nmomentum to get to the top before the dog eats him. He grabs hold\nand scrambles wildly for the top. He makes it.\nFLETCH\nRoll over. Play dead. Good boy.\nFletch now grabs hold\nof the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls\nhimself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the\nvulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and\nthe going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary\neye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and\ncloser to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside.\nFLETCH\nYou any relation to Doctor Dolan?\nNow he's at the\nwindow. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance\nfrom the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't\nbelieve it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window\nwith his elbow.\nFLETCH\nI hate this.\nHe climbs into the\ndarkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around\nthe fenced in yard that surrounds the house.\n123 INT SWARTHOUT'S\nHOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT\nFletch tiptoes though\nthe upstairs bedroom and down the stairs. From outside, he can\nstill hear the dog snarling and barking.\n124 INT. SWARTHOUT'S\nHOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT\nAs Fletch passes\nthrough the living room he sees the dog snarling at him through\nthe living room window.\n125 INT. SWARTHOUT'S\nDEN - NIGHT\nFletch enters and\nlooks around.\nThe dog is now\noutside the den window.\nFLETCH\nMake sure nobody comes in, okay?\nHe goes to the file\ncabinet and opens it.\nHe flips through the\n\"S\" section. \"Stanwyk\". He pulls it. He\nthumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking\nfor. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out.\n125-A INSERT - DEED -\nCLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE\nThree Thousand\nDollars.\nFLETCH (O.S.)\nSo much for your three million dollar ranch.\n126 FLETCH\ntakes out a tiny\ndocument camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads\nit fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file\ncabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he\nsnaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound.\n127 WINDOW\nThe murderous\nDoberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window,\nsending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room\nto rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds.\n128 MASTER\nFletch bolts and the\ndog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all\nthe files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and\nruns through it just as the dog slams into it.\n129 INT. KITCHEN\nFletch is now holed\nup in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full\ncourse of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees\nthat he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in\norder to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that\nwould allow the dog to get in.\nLooking around\nfrantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming\nof the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props\nunder the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of\nthe door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get\nin, and he makes his break for the window.\nHe vaults up onto the\ncounter top and is just about to break the window when he sees\nthat the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening\nthe door.\nFletch knows he has\nonly seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door\nof the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the\nsnarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at\nit. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet\nmignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large\nbucket of cranberry sauce on the dog.\nFLETCH\nSuck on this Cujo!\nThen he dumps an\nequally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily\nvision-impaired, Fletch bolts.\n130 EXT. SWARTHOUT\nHOUSE - NIGHT\nFletch runs as fast\nas humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he\ngoes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his\nhateful face -- is seconds behind and closing.\nFletch makes it to\nhis car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps\nfuriously at the windshield.\n131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR\nFletch makes it to\nhis car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed\nwindow, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred.\nFletch smiles, waves\nat the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera.\nFLETCH\nGimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one...\n(starting the car)\nEverything's fine, now...go take a little nap....\nFletch is ready to\npull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window.\nFletch points back to the house.\nFLETCH\nLook! Defenseless babies!\nThe dog turns to look\nand Fletch guns it.\nFLETCH\nThat dog is such an A**hole.\n132 EXT. FLETCH'S\nAPARTMENT HOUSE - DAY\nFletch parks his car\nhalfway up on the curb, steps out carrying a small overnight bag.\nHe is unshaven and looks beat.\n133 INT. APARTMENT\nHOUSE - CORRIDOR\nFletch comes down the\nhall signing \"Billie Jean\" is an excruciating falsetto.\nFLETCH\n'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...'\nHe opens the door to\nhis apartment and is immediately thrown to the ground.\n134 INT. APARTMENT\nFletch is\nspread-eagled on the floor. Two huge Cops are over him, one\nholding a gun to his head, the other going through his clothes.\nCOP #1\n(feeling the inseam of Fletch's trousers)\nOh, what's this?\nFLETCH\nIf I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here.\nCOP #1\nFunny boy. Look at this....\nHe produces a heroin\nbag.\nCOP#2\nLooks like heroin, Gene.\nFLETCH\nYou just planted that.\nCop #1 kicks Fletch\nin the ribs.\nCOP#2\nWhat'd you say?\nFLETCH\nRead me my rights.\nCOP #1\nOkay. You have the right to remain silent. You\nhave the right to be kicked in the face by me.\nYou have the rights to have your balls stomped.\nYou have the ---\nFLETCH\nHold it! I'll waive my rights.\n135 EXT. PRECINT\nHOUSE\nFletch is lead into\nthe precinct house.\n136 INT. PRECINT\nHOUSE\nThe Sergeant at the\ndesk checks Fletch out.\nSERGEANT\nWho we booking here, gentlemen?\nCOP #1\nNo booking. Chief wants a talk with the boy.\nSERGEANT\nOh Yeah?\n(smiles at Fletch)\nYou'll like the Chief. Nice man.\nFLETCH\nI hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet.\nSERGEANT\nI find he gets real mellow after he hits somebody a lot.\n137 DOOR TO CHIEF'S\nOFFICE - CHIEF'S OFFICE\nThe cops open the\ndoor, pull Fletch inside. Chief Cummings, looking like a modern\nexecutive, looks up from his paperwork.\nCOP #1\nHere he is Chief.\nThey roughly throw\nFletch into a chair. The Chief -- seemingly oblivious to this\nbrutality -- smiles sincerely.\nCUMMINGS\nEasy fellas.\n(To Fletch friendly)\nBe with you in just a second.\nThe two Cops leave.\nAs Chief Cummings continues with his paperwork Fletch looks\naround the office, which is decorated tastefully -- no guns on\nthe wall, no American flags. On one wall there is a Matisse, and\non another, various photos of the Chief with local celebrities.\nFLETCH\nYou decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of \nPolice help you?\nCUMMINGS\n(laughs)\nYou should have seen what she wanted to do \nwith the place. Mauve.\n(shakes his head and pushes his papers aside)\nSo what's your name?\nFLETCH\nFletch.\nCUMMINGS\nFull name.\nFLETCH\nFletch F. Fletch\nCUMMINGS\n(skeptical but patient)\nI see. And what do you do for a living,\nMr. Fletch?\nFLETCH\nI'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.\nCummings just stares\nat Fletch.\nCUMMINGS\nWhy are you doing this Mr. Fletch?\nFLETCH\nFrankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly\nexplains the curious feeling of love I have for you.\nCUMMINGS\nFor a gentleman who was just found holding a bag\nfull of heroin....\nFLETCH\nIt was planted on me, sir.\nCUMMINGS\nWe're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that\nwhat you want...Jane Doe?\nHe suddenly kicks\nFletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor.\nCUMMINGS\nYour editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations\nyou're about to print about police involvement in narcotics\ndealing.\nFletch starts to get\nup, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him\nback down.\nCUMMINGS\nI'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't\nneed some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in \nthe way of my men.\nFLETCH\n'Your men' might just be involved in all this.\nCUMMINGS\nYou idiot. Off the record, deep background:\nI've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.\nCummings picks Fletch\nup, and holds him by the lapels.\nCUMMINGS\nIf you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just \na little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder.\nAnd if you print your story this week, you might get \nsome of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch.\nHe throws Fletch\nagainst the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the\nfloor.\nCUMMINGS\nYou go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll\nmake you regret it.\nFLETCH\n(picks up a picture)\nHey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.\nFletch takes the\npicture and hurls it across the room. It smashes into the\nopposite wall and shatters.\nFLETCH\nI don't like Tommy Lasorda.\n138\nand OMITTED\n139\n140 JAIL CORRIDOR\nFletch is tossed into\nan empty cell by the two Cops who brought him in. Cummings\nwatches. The two Cops leave, and we see that all the cells in\nthis corridor are empty.\nFLETCH\nYou can't keep me here.\nCUMMINGS\nMaybe I'm not going to keep you here.\n(takes out a gun)\nMaybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.\nFLETCH\nI'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.\nThe Chief takes a\nknife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief.\nCUMMINGS\nAfter I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then\nplace it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this\nvery much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of \nminorities that way.\nFLETCH\nMy God, you're serious.\nCUMMINGS\nAsk anybody.\nFLETCH\nCan I ask anybody now?\nCummings looks down\nthe corridor. Deserted.\nFLETCH\nCan I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much\nI've always loved her.\nCUMMINGS\n(cocks the gun)\nWhat'll it be Fletch?\nFletch looks in\nCummings' eyes. They are steely and cold. He is quite serious.\nFLETCH\nI hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me.\nBesides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track\nbetting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia,\ndo you?\nCUMMINGS\n(opening the cell)\nIts been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.\nFletch walks out of\nthe cell. Cummings walks with him through the empty corridor to\nthe exit.\nCUMMINGS\n(very chummy)\nSpeaking of which, you're not going to print\nanything before my investigation is through, are you?\nFLETCH\nNot a prayer.\nCUMMINGS\nThat a boy.\nThe emerge into the\nmain hallway of the police station, which is filled with officers\nand civilians. Cummings makes a show of cordially shaking\nFletch's hand as if they were old friends.\nCUMMINGS\nThanks for coming down to see us.\nFLETCH\nNot at all, Chief. But next time...no tongue, okay?\nExit Fletch.\n141\nthru OMITTED\n147\n148 INT. NEWSPAPER\nOFFICE\nFletch is railing at\nFrank Walker.\nFLETCH\nHow could you call him?\nWALKER\nIt's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting\nboth sides of the story. Something you apparently don't\nknow anything about.\nFLETCH\nIt's also called getting me this close to being murdered.\nWALKER\nGet out of here.\nFLETCH\nHe threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and \nthreatened to kill me right there if I didn't \npromise to give up the story.\nWALKER\nYou know, I've had it up to here with your\nbullsh*t. I need a story from you by tomorrow.\nFLETCH\nYou'll have it.\nWALKER\nBut not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing\ncops, and not horse sh*t paranoid fantasies about\nhomicidal police chiefs.\nFLETCH\n(exiting)\nThanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.\nWALKER\n(calling after him)\nI want something I can print!\nFLETCH\n(giving him the finger)\nPrint this Frank.\nExit Fletch.\n149\nthru OMITTED\n152\n153 EXT. RAQUET CLUB\nFletch again appears\nin his tennis whites and walks familiarly toward the patio. Rich\npeople are having lunch.

She told me to meet her there.\nThat's cabana six?\nWAITER\nCabana one.\nFLETCH\nOne.\nWAITER\nWould you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?\nFLETCH\nI would, actually.\nWAITER\nCharged to the Underhills, sir?\nFLETCH\nRight. Tell you what -- have you caviar?\nWAITER\nYes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.\nFLETCH\n(whistles)\nI'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?\nWAITER\nI recommend it.\nFLETCH\nFine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. \nTo cabana one.\nWAITER\nVery good, sir.\nThe waiter leaves.\nFletch looks around, takes a deep breath.\nFLETCH\nThis is just the nicest place.\n154 OMITTED\nand\n155\n156 EXT.

John...\n(forgets name)\nZnhcneelsky.\nMRS. STANWYK\nJohn Ultramalensky?\nShe opens the door,\nclad only in a towel. A towel is wrapped around her head. She\nseems surprised, but not displeased, to see Fletch. She also\nseems a little at a loss for words.\nFLETCH\nHi.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(finally)\nHi.\nFLETCH\nI was hoping you'd say that.\nThey have just shaken\nhands, and Fletch notices his hand is now sopping wet.\nMRS. STANWYK\nUh...I'm just out of the shower.\nFLETCH\nCan I borrow your towel for a minute?\nShe laughs a nervous\nlittle laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here.\nMRS.

STANWYK\nYou ordered it here?\nFLETCH\nWell, I knew this is where my mouth would be.\nMRS.

STANWYK\nGod....\nShe goes sprinting\ninto the bathroom.\nFLETCH\nCome on in.\nThe door opens. A\nsecond Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the\ngoodies ordered by Fletch.

Underhill.\nWAITER\nMuchas gracias.\nFLETCH\nSierra del fuego.\nThe waiter bows,\nleaves, shuts the door.

STANWYK\nNo.\n(quickly)\nI mean, 'no you can't ask me that.'\nI mean, ask me something else.\nFLETCH\nWhy'd you let me in?\nMRS. STANWYK\nBecause I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it.\nI'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let\nyou in because I'm hungry.\nFLETCH\nThanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, \nwhy didn't you go to Utah with Alan?\nMRS. STANWYK\nUtah is not exactly a cure for boredom.\nFLETCH\nGood point.\nMRS. STANWYK\nOh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look\nwhat I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing\nfor me to do. I don't even know anybody there.\nFLETCH\nWhat about his parents?\nMRS.

I was just taking it for\na little joy ride, that's all....\nFLETCH\nHoly sh*t.\n191-B EXT. CAR\nFletch squeals around\na corner, runs a light, and booms into the parking lot of a large\nHoliday Inn. He's a few seconds ahead of the cops.\nFLETCH\nOkay, kid. Just stand here with your hands\non the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee.\nHere, take my hat.\nFletch pops his hat\non the kid's head, and runs off.\n192 EXT. HOLIDAY INN\nFletch runs into the\nkitchen entrance of the Holiday Inn.\n193 INT. HOLIDAY INN\nKITCHEN\nFletch picks up a\ncase of vegetables and walks through as if he belonged there.\nMoments later, two\ncops enter.\n194 THE COPS\ncan't see him because\nof the crate.\n195 INT. HOLIDAY INN\n- BANQUET ROOM\nA testimonial dinner\nis in progress. A sign on the wall reads:\nTRB SYSTEMS SALUTES\nFRED DORFMAN\n40 YEARS OF SERVICE\nThirty tables of\nconservatively dressed, older men and women are enjoying lunch.\nFletch enters from the kitchen followed by several waiters and\nbusboys. He looks over his shoulder.\n196 FLETCH'S POINT OF\nVIEW - KITCHEN\nTwo cops are in hot\npursuit.\n197 FLETCH\nmoves into the middle\nof the tables as a florid fat Speaker at the dais drones on.\nSPEAKER\n...and he can truly be called the Father\nof Internal Bushings.\nA round of applause\nwhich Fletch joins heartily, as he quickly sits in the audience\nat an empty seat at a table in the center.\nFLETCH\n(to his table)\nHello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you\nenjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked?\nFletch looks to the\nkitchen entrance and sees two cops scanning the crowd. One\nsignals to the opposite door.\n198 DOOR\nFour more cops\nconverge, looking for Fletch. Distant sirens indicate even more.\n199 MASTER\nSPEAKER\nAnd now a man who needs no further introduction....\nThe police spot\nFletch and start moving forward. Fletch stands up. A spotlight\nswings onto him.\nFLETCH\nThank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong\nfriend of....\n(looks at banner)\n...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here.\n200 DIAS\nFred Dorfman turns to\nthe people on either side of him and whispers, obviously\nwondering who the hell this guy is.\n201 FLETCH\nThe cops are hesitant\nto move in. They wait for Fletch to finish and get out of the\nlight.\nFLETCH\nMany of you are probably not aware of Freddie's\nlifelong commitment to honoring a profession that\nfrequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred\nused to forsake a night with his wife and children to\ngo out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent\nAssociation.\n202 POLICE\nlook at each other,\nsensing a trick, and start to move in.\n203 FLETCH\ngoing for broke.\nFLETCH\nOur men in blue are with us today, and I think we\nshould all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on \nthe back and a 'howdy' to them.\n204 POLICE\nmoving faster, but\nimpeded by the crowd which rises and follows Fletch's suggestion.\n205 FLETCH\nout of the crowd,\nstill encouraging the crowd.\nFLETCH\nWhen was the last time you hugged a cop?\nDo it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda.\nDoesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd\ndone it long ago?\none cop raises his\ngun towards Fletch, but the crowd is too close, too busy. Fletch\nshakes his hand and slugs him so hard on the back that he falls\nover into the crowd.\nFLETCH\nLet them know how we feel, with a song. For\nevery cop on every beat in every city of this\ngreat nation.\n(singing)\n'For he's a jolly good fellow....'\n(calls out)\nEverybody!\n(sings)\n'For he's a jolly good fellow....'\nThe crowd sings along\nthe rest of the verse. Fletch looks back to the kitchen entrance\nat the police who are swallowed in a sea of congratulations and\nsinging. Fletch takes his time strolling out of the kitchen.\n206 INT. LAX - DAY\nFletch is at the Pan\nAm counter, talking with a reservation Clerk.\nCLERK\nYes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio\ntomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.\nFLETCH\nYou're kidding.\nCLERK\nWould you like me to change anything?\nFLETCH\n(to himself)\nSo he's going. Uh...are there any other tickets\ncharged to the same account?\nCLERK\nWe'd have no way of knowing that, sir.\nFLETCH\nHmm. It's just that there are some other people\nfrom my office going on this trip and...is there\nanyone in the seat next to me?\nThe clerk checks the\ncomputer.\nCLERK\nYes, there is. Cavanaugh.\nFletch shakes his\nhead. He's never heard of him.\nFLETCH\nNever heard of him. Thanks anyway.\nCLERK\nYou mean her.\nFLETCH\nWhat?\nCLERK\nSally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work\nin your office, she's not from around here.\nFLETCH\nOh, thanks.\nFletch walks off and\nwe follow him.\nCLERK\nShe's from Utah.\n207 EXT.

PROVO STREET\n- DAY\nA lower-middle-class\narea, one that seems to be sliding fast -- the plans are\nscraggly, the houses need paint.\nFletch's rental pulls\nup over the curb onto the sidewalk. Fletch gets out, checks a\npiece of paper, and goes up the steps to a dark-shingled\ntwo-story house.\n209 TOP OF STEPS\nFletch looks at the\nname over the doorbell.\n210 CARD\nwritten in smeared\nink: \"CAVANAUGH\".\n211 FLETCH\nrings the doorbell.\nIt sounds like a fire alarm in the quiet. Nobody answers. Fletch\ntries the door. It opens. Fletch hums the old \"Dragnet\"\ntheme.\n212 INT. HOUSE\nstill humming the\ntheme.\nFLETCH\n'Bom-ba-bom-bom...bommmm.'\nFletch enters.\n213 FLETCH's POINT OF\nVIEW - LIVING ROOM\nThe shelves are bare.\nFurniture is in place.\n214 MASTER\nFletch enters the\nkitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Inside is a can of coffee,\nand some vegetables. Fletch leaves the kitchen and heads for the\nbedroom. We follow him as he enters the bedroom.\n215 INT. BEDROOM\nFletch opens the\ncloset. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch\ngets down and looks under the bed.\nVOICE\nWho the hell are you?\nIn his surprise,\nFletch bangs his head as he starts up.\n216 REVERSE\nAt the door stands a\ngruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls,\nand a hat with earflaps. He holds a rifle.\nMAN\nGet up.\n217 MASTER\nFletch gets up.\nFLETCH\nThe door was unlocked.\nMAN\nLock's busted.\nFLETCH\nNo wonder.\nMAN\nI work for the landlord. He told\nme to watch out for the place.\nFLETCH\nI commend him on his choice.\nMAN\nWhat?\nFLETCH\nI commend him on his choice\nThe Man stares at\nhim, holding the gun. He's not the brightest guy in the world,\nand Fletch has already caught on to that.\nFLETCH\nI was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.\nMAN\nWho are you?\nFLETCH\nDon Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.\nThe Man just stares\nat Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his\nfreedom of movement.\nFLETCH\nWhere is she?\nMAN\nMoved out.\nFLETCH\nShe moved out?\nThe Man nods and\ncocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just\nlooks around the room\nFLETCH\nI spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.\nMAN\nShe moved out.\nFLETCH\nSo you're saying she moved out.\nMAN\nThis morning.\nFLETCH\nThis morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about.\nMoe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael\nand Fredo, are taking over.\nThe Man continues to\ngaze unblinkingly at Fletch, holding the rifle.\nMAN\nWhat did you want under the bed?\nFLETCH\nMattress police. There are no tags on the mattress.\nI'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give\nme your weapon.\nMAN\nI'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.\nFLETCH\nI'm her cousin.\nMAN\nTell the cops.\nFLETCH\nGo ahead. Call them. Better tie\nyour shoelaces first.\nThe man looks down at\nhis shoelaces. Fletch kicks the gun out of his hand and runs\nthrough the house.\n218 EXT. HOUSE\nFletch runs out of\nthe house and jumps into his car.\n219 INT. CAR\nFletch pulls out. The\nrear window is suddenly blown away.\nFLETCH\nI'm getting real tired of all this hostility.\n220 EXT.

Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.\nMARVIN\n(smiles)\nHarry S. Truman?\nFLETCH\nMy parents were great fans of the former President.\nMARVIN\nIsn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.\nFLETCH\nSure did. Dropped the big one on them.\nMARVIN\nDropped two big ones. Real fighter.\nYou're in the insurance line, Harry?\nFLETCH\nRight.\nMARVIN\nWell, I'm fully covered.\nFLETCH\nI don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the\nsub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by\nAlan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.\nMARVIN\nYes. Where you from, Harry?\nFLETCH\nCalifornia. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route.\nCan I ask you a few questions?\nMARVIN\nCome on in.\n222 INT. MARVIN AND\nVELMA'S LIVING ROOM\nFletch and the\nStanwyks face each other on couches that flank the fireplace.\nFletch has a clipboard on which he will take notes.\nFLETCH\nFirst, a couple of routine things:\nare you and you wife currently alive?\nMarvin just stares at\nhim.\nFLETCH\nRegulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....\nMARVIN\nVelma.\nVelma smiles.\nFLETCH\nVelma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk,\nBeverly Hills, California, executive vice president\nof Boyd Aviation?\nMARVIN\nCheck.\nFLETCH\nOkay.\n(makes notation)\nNow, the last time you saw your son was when?\nMARVIN\nOh, about ten days ago.\nFletch is taken\naback.\nFLETCH\nTen days ago?\nMARVIN\nThat's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.\nThis is all news to\nFletch, but he covers his surprise.\nFLETCH\nIsn't that nice. Since when?\nMARVIN\nSince he moved to L.A.\nFletch is very\ninterested in all this.\nFLETCH\nForgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand\nthat there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.\nMARVIN\nWhat the hell does this have to do with insurance?\nFLETCH\nTrust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.\nMARVIN\nWell, you can forget about that lady friend business,\nAlan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He\ndotes on that bride of his.\nVELMA\nCute young thing, too.\nFLETCH\nI'm sorry?\nVELMA\nHis bride. Cute as a button.\nFLETCH\nYou've met her?\nMARVIN\nWell, of course we have. He brings her with him.\nFletch is getting\nvery puzzled and very concerned about all this.\nFLETCH\nHas Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?\nMarvin and Velma\nexchange the oddest of glances between them.\nFLETCH\nHas he?\nMARVIN\nBoy, what the hell's the matter with you?\nFLETCH\nThen he has.\nMARVIN\nCourse he has. That's his wife.\nYou could knock\nFletch over with a straw. Again, he quickly recovers.\nFLETCH\nOf course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?\nVELMA\nCute thing.\nFLETCH\n(starting to sweat a little)\nDo you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?\nVELMA\nOh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.\nVelma rummages\nthrough a family album on a side table as Fletch tried to sort\nall this out in his mind. She brings a photo over to him. He\nlooks at it.\n223 INSERT - PHOTO\nIt's a wedding photo\nof Alan and a woman we have not seen. She is brunette and quite\nunlike Gail. Alan wears a similar sh*t-eating grin, and makes a\nsimilar thumbs-up gesture to the wedding photo with Gail that\nFletch saw in Boyd's office.\n224 FLETCH\nHe sighs.\nFLETCH\nAnd they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann.\nMARVIN\nOf course they are.\nVELMA\nShe's cute as a button.\nFLETCH\nHow long have they been married?\nMARVIN\nLets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April.\nFLETCH\nMrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise \nto send it back to you. It's routine, really. \nThe actuarial people need to ---\nVELMA\nOh, that's all right, I've got lots more.

Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question:\nWhat's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. \nBigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?\nHe takes a spoonful\nof airline food, chewing meditatively.\nFLETCH\n(continuing)\nBiggest Question: Why do I eat this sh*t?\n(to passing stewardess)\nMiss, I believe this has already been eaten.\n232 EXT. MRS.\nSTANWYK'S CABANA - NIGHT\nFletch knocks on the\ndoor, and a tensely white-faced Mrs. Stanwyk quickly lets him in\nand shuts the door behind him.\nMRS. STANWYK\nI want you to know that dramatic phone\ncalls about secret meetings scare the\nsh*t out of me.\nHe can sense she is\nunusually upset.\nFLETCH\nWhat's wrong, Gail?\nMRS. STANWYK\nI decided I was going to tell my\nhusband about you today.\nFLETCH\nNo.\nMRS. STANWYK\nBut first I called the Hall of Records in Provo.\nThey checked on the deed. You're telling the truth.\nA minute later Alan came in the room and asked me\nwhy I was shaking.\nFletch waits\nanxiously to hear if she told Alan about him.\nMRS. STANWYK\nSo I told him...I told him I was\njust cold or something.\nFletch sighs with\nrelief.\nMRS. STANWYK\nI've never lied to him before.\n(chokes back a sob)\nIt's the first time he's ever lied to\nme. He was just as convincing as when\nhe says 'I love you.'\nFLETCH\nI think you better sit down.\nMRS. STANWYK\nOh God, I hate things that start like that....\nFLETCH\nGail, please.\nShe sits in a chair.\nhe hands her the wedding photo.\nFLETCH\nI got this from Alan's parents. By\nthe way, they see him all the time.\nFirst she looks at\nFletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't\nseem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad.\nMRS. STANWYK\nWhat is this....\nFLETCH\nI checked. There was no divorce.\nMRS. STANWYK\nAre you telling me my husband is a bigamist???\nFLETCH\nI'm telling you he's not your husband at all.\nShe is stunned.\nFLETCH\nAnd they're leaving the country tomorrow night.\nMRS.

STANWYK\nHOUSE - NIGHT\nFletch parks his Olds\nhalfway up on the sidewalk, and gets out. He climbs over the\ngates of the Stanwyk home, and drops down inside.

STANWYK'S\nGARAGE\nThe jaguar is parked\njust where it is supposed to be, and the key is in the ignition.\nFletch thinks for a moment and looks around. He sees a pile of\ntorn rags on the ground.

He's\nstunned, and not about to read anymore of this.\nGAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)\nKeep reading, Alan.\nStanwyk spins to the\ndoorway.\n259-A GAIL STANWYK\nstanding in the\ndoorway.\nMRS. STANWYK\nDon't worry, I can take it.\n260 MASTER\nFLETCH\nYou shouldn't be here.\nMRS. STANWYK\nI want to hear this.\nFletch takes the\nletter from Alan.\nFLETCH\nHe doesn't read my stuff well.\n(reads)\n'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago\nand never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist \neven in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with \nthree million dollars in cash, the result of\nGail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock.\nMrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to\npurchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact\nthat can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout\nof Provo.'\n(aside)\nThat was stupid, Alan.\nMR. STANWYK\nI'd have been long gone.\nFLETCH\nAhem.\n(continues reading)\n'Sally Ann can confirm all this when\nthe police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'\nMr. Stanwyk\nblanches. Fletch continues.\nFLETCH\n'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler,\nbut you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper.\nSincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.'\nAlan mulls over all\nthis for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully.\nMR. STANWYK\nBravo, Mr. Fletcher.\nFLETCH\nThe thing that really tipped it off for me\nwas something your wife said to me while we\nwere in bed together.\nStanwyk shoots a\nsurprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug.\nMR. STANWYK\n(to Fletch)\nAnd what was that?\nFLETCH\nHow similar in build you and I are.\nthen I figured it. You bump me off,\nthrow me in the car, and burn me up.\nMRS. STANWYK\nMy God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you?\nNow it is Alan's turn\nto shrug innocently.\nMR. STANWYK\nSorry, darling.\nMRS. STANWYK\nYou sonofabitch.\nMR. STANWYK\nYes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a stupid sonofabitch.\nMr. Stanwyk reaches\ninto his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch.\nMR. STANWYK\nI was already prepared to commit one murder. \nWhat makes you think I won't commit two?\nFLETCH\nWhoops.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(her bravado deflated)\n'Whoops?' What do you mean 'whoops?'\nDon't say 'whoops.'\nMR. STANWYK\nI mean, by the time your story gets published, I'll\nbe on the beach. I understand extradition from Rio is\nvery complicated. I'll bet for two murders it's even more so.\nFLETCH\nThat is a lighter, isn't it?\nJust then, the French\ndoors swing open, and Chief Cummings enters.\nCUMMINGS\nGreetings, everyone.\nFLETCH\n(dryly)\nThank God, the police.\nMR. STANWYK\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\nCUMMINGS\nPut the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.\nStanwyk lowers the\ngun.\nMRS. STANWYK\n(to Fletch)\nI thought you had this all figured\nout. Good going 'Irwin.'\nFLETCH\nDon't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?\nMRS. STANWYK\n(to Cummings)\nI've got it all under control, \nJerry. You can go now.\nCUMMINGS\n(laughs)\nUnder control? You idiot. You\ndidn't know who he was?\nDuring the following\ndialogues, Fletch starts nudging the fireplace's gas lighter jet\nkey with his foot.\nCUMMINGS\nFat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy.\nIt began to occur to me that some things are\nbeginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.\nMR. STANWYK\nI said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position\nshouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go\nhome and I'll call you tomorrow.\nCUMMINGS\nWhat, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear\nyou say something about Rio, Alan. You're not \nleaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars\nI staked you for the next load, are you?\nFLETCH\nWhoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk\nover, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty.\nFletch and Gail\nactually start to leave, but Cummings draws his gun and fires\nover their heads. They dive for the floor, landing on the side of\nthe fireplace. Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from his pocket.\nMR. STANWYK\nJerry, you're simply going to have to trust me.\nI've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy\nand now you're jeopardizing everything.\nCUMMINGS\nYour 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on\nthe front page while you're basking in Rio.\nFLETCH\n...with your money.\nCummings turns his\nhead momentarily to consider what Fletch has said, and Stanwyk\ntakes advantage of the distraction to go for his gun. But he is\ntoo slow. Cummings shoots once, striking Stanwyk in the chest,\nkilling him instantly.\nGail screams in\nhorror. Cummings turns to Fletch.\nCUMMINGS\nThis one's going to be even more fun.\nFLETCH\n(striking the Zippo)\nGo ahead. Make my evening.\nFletch hurls the\nlighter into the fireplace, causing a great whoosh of flames.\nCummings throws his hands up in front of his face and Fletch\nleaps at him, wrestling him to the ground. Cummings is the\nstronger of the two, and just as he starts to gain dominance over\nFletch, Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet, picks up her husband's\ntennis racket in it's wooden brace, and slams it against\nCummings' head with all her might.\nThe Chief is knocked\nout.\nFletch lies there,\npanting, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at Gail, still\nholding the racket, and staring at Alan's body. Fletch hustles\nher out of the room.\n260-A HALLWAY\nFLETCH\nI'm calling the police. Then I'm\nleaving. You wait here for them.\nGAIL\nWhere are you going?\nFLETCH\nAway. I think it might take you a while to get \nyour life back together. You don't need me around.\n(indicates the library)\nDon't go back in there.\nHe starts to leave.\nShe calls after him.\nGAIL\n(still holding the racket)\nI really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?\nFLETCH\n(smiles)\nYou sure did.\nFletch exits.\nDISSOLVE TO\n261 EXT. RIO DE\nJANEIRO - DAY\nWith Sugarloaf\nMountain in the b.g., Fletch lies in a lounge chair, sipping an\nexotic drink, watching the cavorting lovelies and playing his\nbattered Casio. This is obviously at some very expensive beach\nclub or hotel, as witnessed by the uniformed servant who brings a\ntelephone.\nWAITER\n(Brazilian accent)\nYour call is come through.\nFLETCH\nFar out.\n(to the phone)\nLarry? It's Fletch.\n(pause, looks around)\nWell, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm.\n(pause)\nOh, tell Frank I need a couple of months.\nThe fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.\nHe pauses again to\nlisten to Larry, but sees something O.S. that takes over his\nattention. he doesn't wait for Larry to finish what she's saying.\nFLETCH\nI gotta go, Lar.\nHe hangs up and\nstands. We see that Gail has just walked up to him. The way they\nlook at each other indicates they have not seen each other for\nawhile, and her arrival is a surprise to Fletch.\nGAIL\nJohn Ultramalensky, right?\nFLETCH\nRight.\nGAIL\nGod, I haven't seen you since the wedding.\nFLETCH\nGee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---\nGAIL\nNot mine, stupid. Yours.\nFLETCH\n(big smile)\nWhat are you doing here?\nThey start walking\ndown the beach. We stay right with them.\nGAIL\nI couldn't sit home and play the mournful \nwidow anymore, and the police didn't need me,\nso I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, \nbut the announcer talked to fast and I\ncouldn't understand a lot of what was \nhappening, so I figured if I came\ndown here maybe you could explain the\nrules to me, and besides, I missed you.\nFLETCH\nNo problem.\nHe puts his arm\naround her, as we watch them leave us behind and walk off down\nthe beach.\nFLETCH\nBasketball, of course, was invented in France,\nand is played with a large ball, two tongue \ndepressors and a fish....\nFletch ad-libs just\nlike Chevy Chase would as they walk further away down the beach\nuntil we....\nFADE OUT\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFletch\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Phil A.
