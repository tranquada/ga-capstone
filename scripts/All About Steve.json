Specifically, life\n          is most like a crossword puzzle.\n          There are a million reasons why,\n          not the least of which is that\n          life, like crosswords, requires the\n          use of your whole entire brain-\n          Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills\n          all over the puzzle.\n\n<b>                         MARY\n</b>          Crap.\n          The puzzle answers all run together.\n\n<b>          INT.

It's\n          true. In the New York Times, for\n          example, the puzzles get harder as\n          the week goes. So on Monday, a day\n          that traditionally bites the big\n          one, the crossword is super easy.\n          It's comforting to know that\n          although life can be difficult at\n          times, crosswords let you off easy\n          when you need it the most.\n          Mary looks around for anybody to talk to.

Crosswords\n          only care if you're an idiot.

It was the media thing, you\n          know, that's why our moms wanted us\n          to get together. You work in the\n          media, so do I.

We're\n          professionally compatible, yes, but\n          it's occurring to me at this\n          particular moment that we're also\n          sexually compatible, and I don't\n          know if you noticed like I noticed\n          but we're also both wearing blue.\n          What are the chances of that?\n          Actually, if I really think about\n          it, the chances are probably pretty\n          good.
