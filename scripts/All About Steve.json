KITCHEN - DAY\n          A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ\n          scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second\n          between each one.\n\n          MARY (V.O.)\n          Vita aenigma est. Life is a\n          puzzle. It is. Specifically, life\n          is most like a crossword puzzle.\n          There are a million reasons why,\n          not the least of which is that\n          life, like crosswords, requires the\n          use of your whole entire brain-\n          Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills\n          all over the puzzle.\n\n                         MARY\n          Crap.\n          The puzzle answers all run together.\n\n          INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n\n          Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty\n          except for one.\n          In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best\n          synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own\n          red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to\n          herself.\n\n                         MARY\n          Four letter word for... vomit.\n          She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.\n\n                         MARY\n          Not \"barf\". For sure not \"barf\".\n          That's too easy. \"Puke\" is okay,\n          but maybe a bit pedestrian (that\n          means boring)... I like \"hurl\". I\n          do. I like the way it rolls off\n          your tongue -- the word, I mean.\n          But my all time favorite is none of\n          those.\n          She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it\n          together.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n                         MARY\n          Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E-\n          W. Spew... Sp-ew.\n          A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER\n          walks out.\n          A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals\n          to Mary.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          We're ready for you now.\n          (a plastic Kroger shopping\n          Mary jumps up, grabs her purse\n          bag).\n\n                         MARY\n          Jesus help me.\n\n          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n          Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, \"CAREER DAY\" written\n          in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the\n          class of 10 year old KIDS.\n          The Teacher reads from her notes.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Here's a treat, students. Our\n          final guest for Career Day, Miss\n          Mary Horowitz, is the crossword\n          constructor for the Atlanta\n          Citizen. You know the crossword\n          puzzles you see every week in the\n          newspaper? It's her job to create\n          them. Isn't that fun?\n          Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.\n\n                         MARY\n          You weren't supposed to tell them.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Pardon me?\n\n                         MARY\n          I made a crossword puzzle to help\n          them guess what my job is. You\n          ruined it.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Oh, I'm so sorry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n          Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at\n          them like lost puppies.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Maybe you could tell them a bit\n          about what your job is like?\n           watche s hit\n\n                          GARBAGE\n          Mary drops thu p file out her\n          the bottom She p lls\n           u hearsed enthusiasm.\n          bag, reads with re\n\n                         MARY\n          People do crossword puzzles all the\n          time but they don't often think of\n          the person who made all the words\n          fit together, and who thought up\n          the clues, and who made sure the\n          little black squares at the top\n          mirror the ones at the bottom.\n          She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds\n          it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile.\n\n                         MARY\n          Crossword constructors usually have\n          above average intelligence, with\n          knowledge of just about every\n          subject you can imagine. And it\n          helps if they can spell.\n          The card in Mary's hand reads \"LAUGH\". She laughs. Nobody\n          else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets\n          serious, sweeps her hand through the air.\n\n                         MARY\n          Imagine, for a moment, a world\n          without crossword puzzles. A world-\n          Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her\n          off.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Daniel, you have a question?\n\n                         DANIEL\n          You make a living doing that? Just\n          making puzzles? The Atlanta\n          Citizen only comes out on Fridays.\n          One puzzle a week can't make you\n          enough to live on.\n          A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          LARGE KID\n          How do you pay your rent?\n\n                         MARY\n          My parents -\n\n                         DANIEL\n          You live with your parents?\n          The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at\n          them.\n\n          LARGE KID\n          Oh my God, how old are you? Still\n          living at home!\n          The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Children!\n          The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary\n          hyperventilating.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Are you okay?\n          Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.\n\n                         MARY\n          Water.\n\n                         TEACHER\n          Water. Just hang on.\n          The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.\n\n                         MARY\n          Yep, I live at home...\n          She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.\n\n                         MARY\n          But so do all of you, so there...\n          And sure, I only create one\n          crossword puzzle a week but I have\n          deadlines, I have stress, I have\n          demands on me so huge you would not\n          believe. The newspaper business is\n          hell. I mean it. Hell.\n          Somebody's got to write about all\n          the horrors that go on in this\n          world.\n\n                         (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n          MARY (cont'd)\n          And after people read about those\n          horrors, somebody else has to bring\n          them back from the brink of\n          suicide. Who do you think that is?\n          She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than\n          anybody.\n\n                         MARY\n          Me! My crossword puzzle is always\n          good news. it enlightens.\n          it r andma's\n          entertains. It keeps your g\n          mind alive so she remembers to send\n          you five bucks on your birthday.\n          Think about that as you lie in bed\n          tonight picking your nose and crying\n          yourself to sleep. I know I will.\n          The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's\n          desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.\n\n                         MARY\n          My job matters, you know. In media\n          circles I am, as the Dutch say,\n          geliefd. That means I have plenty\n          of friends. Hoards, in fact.\n          Scads even.\n          The kids aren't buying it.\n\n          LARGE KID\n          You're a freak.\n          The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.\n          The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,\n          hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it\n          runs down her chin.\n          Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.\n\n                         MARY\n          That's a pretty blouse.\n          The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.\n\n          EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY\n\n          The front doors of the school swing open and a visibly shaken\n          Mary walks out. She takes a deep breath and embraces denial.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n\n                         MARY\n          Twelve letter phrase for smashing\n          success!\n          She heads down the walkway toward the bus stop.\n\n                         MARY\n          As one would say in old Paris...\n          Coup de maitre!\n           A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on\n          talking - now to him.\n\n                         MARY\n          It means \"master stroke\", even\n          though the direct translation is\n          actually \"master blow\"... Leave it\n          to the French to pass off an\n          unpleasant slave activity as an\n          everyday expression.\n          The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.\n          Mary continues on to the bus stop.\n\n          INT. CITY BUS -- DAY\n\n           The CITY BUS DRIVER watches as Mary pays her $1.75 one nickel\n          at a time.\n\n                         MARY\n          I sometimes suffer from benign\n          positional vertigo. Could you\n          please not drive until I'm -\n          f He ignores her, starts driving. Mary struggles toward the\n          back o f the bus, grabbing g\n          goes.\n\n                         MARY\n          Excuse me... pardonnez-moi...\n          begnadiyen sie mich...\n          She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her\n          shoulder on the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks\n          under her sweater at the shoulder damage.\n\n                         MARY\n          Hello hematoma.\n          She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.\n          The lady gives her the \"don't talk to me\" glare, then stares\n          out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7.\n\n          MARY (V.O.)\n          In crosswords, as in life, some\n          days are harder than others. It's\n          true. In the New York Times, for\n          example, the puzzles get harder as\n          the week goes. So on Monday, a day\n          that traditionally bites the big\n          one, the crossword is super easy.\n          It's comforting to know that\n          although life can be difficult at\n          times, crosswords let you off easy\n          when you need it the most.\n          Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other\n          PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails.\n\n           EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\n          A frail 80 year old man MR. TAKIHASHI works alongside his\n          wspapers,\n          40ish granddaughter BETTY selling magazines, ne\n          smokes and Pocky.\n          In the corner of the newsstand, a muted TV features CNN\n          \"Breaking News\" coverage of a high speed car chase.\n          BUSINESSMEN are glued to the images as they wait in line.\n          Mary grabs a half a dozen different newspapers, yells to Mr.\n          Takihashi like he's deaf.\n\n                         MARY\n\n          KONCHA, TAKIHASHI-SAN!\n          He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty.\n\n                         MARY\n          Hi Betty.\n          Betty just rings up the papers.\n\n                         MARY\n          Did you see the review of\n          \"Hairspray\" in the Journal\n          yesterday? They used the word\n          \"spectacular\" -- always a good\n          sign. Maybe you'd like to go see\n          it with rne? I have a coupon for\n          five dollars off.\n          Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points\n          at them, then speaks in barely recognizable English.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          S.\n\n                         BETTY\n          Nine dollar twenty.\n          Mary fishes in her bag for money.\n\n                         MARY\n          We could bring your dad if you\n          want. I don't think the show is\n          ageist. That means he won't feel\n          like a loser for being old.\n          As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures\n          about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her.\n\n                         BETTY\n          Pecha kucha! Do Itta!\n          Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next\n          customer.\n\n                         MARY\n          So no then? That's a no?\n          Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her\n          bag.\n\n          MARY (V.O.)\n          Sometimes crosswords are even\n          better than life. Here's how.\n          They don't discriminate.\n          Crosswords don't care if you're\n          young or old; black or white; male,\n          female or intersex. Crosswords\n          only care if you're an idiot. And,\n          really, that's okay, because if you\n          have the IQ of a yam, finishing a\n          crossword should be the least of\n          your worries.\n          Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away.\n\n          INT. CNN LOADING BAY - DAY\n\n          A half dozen NEWS CREWS rush to load and unload CNN news ECHS --\n          vans.

HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY\n\n           It's house that's been lived in. Every inch cluttered with\n           old newspapers, family photos, various objet d'art, and\n          books, books and more books.\n           Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room\n          where her 50ish mother, MRS. HOROWITZ, sits reading with MR.\n          HOROWITZ (late 50's, professorial head to toe, furrowed brow\n          to worn loafers).\n\n                         MARY\n          \"Brilliant\" is what they said.\n          Never in the history of St.\n          Margaret's Career Day have the\n          children's brains been so\n          inordinately stimulated as they\n          were today by my presentation.\n\n          MRS.

This is\n          what normal girls your age do.\n          Mary stops on the stairs.\n\n                         MARY\n          I'm normal.\n          Silence from her parents.

HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n           Storage room or bedroom? Boxes and books all over the place.\n           In the middle of it all, a bed.\n           On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a\n          1970's. Taped to the mirror, the chosen photo Horowitz\n           smart blue sweater and skirt ensemble. An\n           wears the exact same outfit. Oddly,\n           surprisingly current and actually hot.\n           She leans over the gerbil cage next to her desk, taps to wake\n          up the :Lone, fat occupant.\n\n                         MARY\n          Carol, tonight I have a date. A\n          blind one. Not the guy, I mean the\n          situation. We are, as yet, unknown\n          to one another... It's nerve\n          wracking, I know. Try not to have\n          a spontaneous epileptiform seizure.\n          The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled\n          voices downstairs.\n          She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a\n          paper bag.\n          There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,\n          puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a crack.\n          It's her mother.\n\n          MRS.

HOROWITZ\n          Look at you.\n\n                         MARY\n          i already did. Repeatedly.\n\n          MRS.

And\n          interesting.\n          Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.\n\n                         MARY\n          Let's hope all that does it for\n          him.\n\n          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n          A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs.\n          Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes\n          each step like her knees are fused together but still manages\n          to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised.\n          With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir\n          is screaming \"hallelujah\" in her brain.\n          As Mary reaches the bottom step --\n\n                         STEVE\n          Mary, hi. I'm Steve.\n          She puts up a finger - \"just a second\".\n          She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.\n          Horowitz, confused.\n\n          MRS. HOROWITZ\n          And how's your mother?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Great. Thanks.\n          She just stares at him and smiles.\n\n          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach\n          and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer.\n\n                         MARY\n          Gods. You may have noticed that\n          I'm wearing clean socks.\n          Translation: I'm really trying and\n          thus should be amply rewarded.\n          Thanks for your support.\n          She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.\n\n                         MARY\n          And by support I don't mean, you\n          know -\n          She hikes up her bra.\n\n                         MARY\n          I mean your assistance, your\n          furtherance, your advocacy of my\n          efforts to get out there and... do\n          what I'm supposed to do.\n          She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.\n\n          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n          Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a\n          bit more relaxed.\n\n          MRS. HOROWITZ\n          There we go.\n          Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red\n          boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the\n          boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Ready?\n          Mary nods a bunch of times.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          16.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Mrs. Horowitz.

Don't forget your\n          seatbelts.\n          Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the\n          living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to\n          hide her worry but failing miserably.\n\n          MR. HOROWITZ\n          She'll be fine.\n          They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.\n\n          EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n          Steve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary\n          waits at her door, nervous but smiling.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Sorry about this blind date thing.\n          My mother -\n\n                         MARY\n          I never went to kindergarten!\n          He looks at her, totally confused.\n\n                         MARY\n          They skipped me to the forth grade.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Okay.\n          She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates\n          then heads to the driver's side, gets in.\n\n                         MARY\n          I missed finger painting.\n          He has no clue what to say.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Sorry?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17.\n\n                         MARY\n          Me too.\n          She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back\n          inches short.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Whoa!\n          Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and\n          tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips.\n          He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway,\n          all the while straining to see the Horowitz house.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Mary... uh, what about your mother?\n          She straddles him and keeps kissing.\n\n                         MARY\n          You're not her type. And she's\n          married.\n\n                         STEVE\n          No, we're right in front of your\n          house and...\n          She undoes her sweater.\n\n                         STEVE\n          And I have no problem with that\n          whatsoever.\n          She kisses his neck. He looks up with a \"thank you, God\".\n\n                         MARY\n          Steve?\n\n                         STEVE\n          Mary.\n\n                         MARY\n          Is it Steven with a V or Stephen\n          with a P-H?\n\n                         STEVE\n\n          V.\n          She works over his face over like it's an ice cream cone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18.\n\n                         MARY\n          I thought so. There are almost a\n          million Stevens with a V in the\n          country, you know. It's much more\n          popular than the P-H way, almost\n          twice as popular in fact. I think\n          it's the Brits who prefer the P-H.\n          They love their P-H's over there.\n          Not as much as they love their fish\n          and chips but still, they love\n          them. It was the media thing, you\n          know, that's why our moms wanted us\n          to get together. You work in the\n          media, so do I. We really have to\n          hand it to our moms, Steve, we do,\n          and not just for raising us, or for\n          thriving during a time when women\n          painstakingly struggled for\n          equality, but I mean we should hand\n          it to them for being visionaries\n          and predicting our all encompassing\n          compatibility. We're\n          professionally compatible, yes, but\n          it's occurring to me at this\n          particular moment that we're also\n          sexually compatible, and I don't\n          know if you noticed like I noticed\n          but we're also both wearing blue.\n          What are the chances of that?\n          Actually, if I really think about\n          it, the chances are probably pretty\n          good.

It's true. Sure he'll go\n          for a few skanks here and there but\n          it's all just a sad attempt to hide\n          his fear. All he wants is to love\n          but he's afraid of opening up,\n          afraid of putting himself out\n          there, afraid of somebody like you,\n          Mary - yes you - afraid of you\n          breaking his heart. Can you blame\n          him?\n          She's a bit stunned and confused by all of this.\n\n                         MARY\n          No?\n\n                         HARTMAN\n          No! Promise me this. Promise\n          you'll stick around long enough to\n          help him get over that fear. He\n          tells you to go away, don't. He\n          says he thinks you're crazy?\n          You're not. He's crazy, Mary.\n          Crazy not to let down his walls and\n          tell you how he really feels. Can\n          I count on you to hang in there no\n          matter what?\n\n                         MARY\n          Of course. I don't want to\n          interfere in his work but I just\n          need to be here for him and -\n          He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and\n          yet she keeps talking.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          52.\n\n                         HARTMAN\n          Good girl.\n          The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be\n          behind the fence. Hartman holds up his press pass to get rid\n          of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her toward the\n          protestors, starts backing away.\n\n                         HARTMAN\n          I'll tell Steve to come find you\n          when we wrap for the day.

Hartman laughs.\n\n                         HARTMAN\n          You might want to jump camps. No\n          way they're going let that baby\n          keep the third leg and live like a\n          freak. Trust me.\n          He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp.\n          Mary calls out to him.\n\n                         MARY\n          She'd just be like the tree frogs.\n          Hartman turns around.

In some ponds there's like a\n          quarter of the tree frogs with\n          extra legs. Totally natural.\n          Hartman looks at her like she's a nutcase.\n\n          EXT.
