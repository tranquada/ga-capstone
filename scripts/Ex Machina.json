The plastic is cream.\r\n     The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel.\r\n\r\n     The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There\r\n     are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate\r\n     digits.\r\n\r\n     Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin\r\n     is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb,\r\n     it is almost invisible unless side-lit.\r\n\r\n     The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic\r\n     construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly\r\n     beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of\r\n     the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from\r\n     a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves -\r\n     except for one thing.\r\n\r\n     There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her\r\n     eyes.\r\n<b>                                                         19.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nAs we observe AVA, she fits a section of skull-plate to the\r\nback of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThen -\r\n\r\n- she half turns. As if having become aware of another\r\npresence in the room.\r\n\r\n<b>REVEAL -\r\n</b>\r\n- the room in which AVA stands.\r\n\r\nAVA'S living area is made up of three primary spaces.\r\n\r\nThe main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area,\r\narranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi-\r\nopaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like\r\nstructure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror.\r\nAnd behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a\r\nsmall decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is\r\nsealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass.\r\n\r\nThere are also several oval discs positioned around the room,\r\nmade of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are\r\ninduction plates.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box.\r\n\r\nAnd facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nBeside which, CALEB stands.\r\n\r\nA beat -\r\n\r\n- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time.\r\n\r\nThen -\r\n\r\n- AVA starts walking. Revealing a secondary impact of her\r\nengineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her\r\nsteps. The fluidity of her action.\r\n\r\nCALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\nThen she sits down.\r\n\r\nAnd speaks.\r\n\r\n<b>                      AVA\r\n</b>           Hello.\r\n<b>                                                          20.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nHer voice has no digital inflections.
