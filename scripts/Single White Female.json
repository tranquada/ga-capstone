We see a little girl, aged\r\naround eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing\r\nearrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She\r\nmoves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The\r\nfirst girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl\r\nare smiling.\r\n\r\nMore credits, still without capital letters.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl.\r\nThe two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder\r\npuff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives\r\nthe impression to be located behind the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN\r\n\r\nThe title of the film appears on the black screen.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of\r\nthe screen :\r\n\r\nBUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThis building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nCredits resume on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The\r\nbuilding itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building.\r\n\r\nAs the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one\r\nmale, one female. They are the voices of Allison \u00abAllie\u00bb Jones and\r\nher fianc\u00e9 Sam Rawson.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       So how many kids do we want ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       I dunno. What's the statistical norm ?\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       You and your statistics.\r\n\r\nAllison laughs\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       One point two.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Okay, then I want two point two.\r\n\r\nFade to :\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is\r\nholding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old.\r\nAllison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair.\r\n\r\nBehind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the\r\nbalcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street\r\nlights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last\r\nvoice over sentence.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       And I want them to look like you.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Poor kids.\r\n\r\nEnd of credits.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer\r\n       tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?\r\n\r\nShe moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a\r\nplate lying on the floor.\r\n       SAM\r\n       As opposed to a fake one ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the\r\n       big ceremony with too hundred people.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have\r\n       any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a\r\n       steam room in the wild. Horseback.\r\n\r\nAllison goes back into Sam's arms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Naked skydiving ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Naked skydiving !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know.\r\n       I've not been in New York long enough to know very many\r\n       people.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Except me.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, you're invited.\r\n\r\nThey laugh.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       And my friend Graham upstairs.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       It won't be long before you know half the people in New\r\n       York. People like you, you know... but I found you first.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that\r\n       ever happened to me.\r\n\r\nThey start kissing very tenderly.\r\n\r\nFade to two seconds of black screen. And then we see Sam and\r\nAllison asleep in the bed. They are naked but covered with the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings. Allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hello ?... Hold on a second.\r\n\r\nShe bends down to take the telephone set.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Sam, it's your ex-wife.\r\nShe gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the\r\nphone.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's Lisa.\r\n\r\nSam puts the receiver to his ear. We hear vaguely Lisa's voice,\r\nbut not precisely enough to understand the words.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now.\r\n\r\nHe puts the handset back on the telephone set, which Allison had\r\nput on the bed.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's where you live. She's entitled.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings again. Allison moves up to pick up the phone.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Don't... don't answer it.\r\n\r\nThe phone keeps on ringing. Then the answering machine starts with\r\n\u00abHi, it's Allison Jones...\u00bb but the rest of the message is covered\r\nby Sam and Allison's conversation.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Why does she do this ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that.\r\nWe hear the beep at the end of Allison's message.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is walking naked in the hall.\r\n\r\n       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       Hello, Sam. Oh, damn... Would you pick up the phone,\r\n       please ? Hello ?... Please, don't do this to me.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       Lisa...\r\n\r\n       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this\r\n       afternoon...\r\n\r\nAllison is standing up in the dark, not moving. We hear Sam's\r\nvoice, partly from the bedroom, and partly from the answering\r\nmachine, which gives the voice a sort of echo effect.\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       Yeah... Lisa... Can we talk about this tomorrow ?\r\n\r\n       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then...\r\n\r\nClose-up on Allison's face in the dark. She looks very shocked by\r\nwhat she hears.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over and yelling)\r\n       Allie, Allie, I don't know how you shut that thing off.\r\n\r\n       LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       You said you were going to call.\r\n\r\nAllison shuts the machine off.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on Sam's face. He picks up the phone and puts the handset\r\nto his ear. We hear Lisa's voice saying : \u00abHello, Sam\u00bb\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Huh-huh...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APPARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison grabs a night-robe and presses it on her naked body.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       Okay ... goodbye.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam is seated on the bed. He puts the phone back on the set.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I take it back. She's not entitled.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom.\r\nThe air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill,\r\nas can be found in old New-York buildings.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie.\r\n       I swear to God.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment. We can hear\r\nthe conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo\r\neffect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but\r\nstill well enough to get the general idea of the conversation.\r\n       SAM (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our\r\n       divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been\r\n       drinking.\r\n\r\nSlowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed.\r\n\r\nGraham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later\r\nthat he is gay. He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see\r\nonly his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets.\r\nHe was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system\r\nand is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       I don't want to hear this !\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't\r\n       happen again.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       (a few words incomprehensible)\r\n       I am supposed to trust you now ?\r\n\r\nGraham is listening with a worried look on his face.\r\n\r\nFade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on\r\nhearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but\r\nwithout understanding the words. And then :\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison rings the bell of Graham's apartment. It says 1203 on the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\nA corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to\r\nthe ceiling. Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants.\r\nHe is bare-chested.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       It's 4 a.m. !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over through the door)\r\n       It's me, Graham.\r\n\r\nGraham opens the door. Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and\r\nher face is full of tears.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be\r\n       alone tonight... so I came up here.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thanks.\r\n\r\nGraham closes the door behind Allison.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA nice room with pictures on the wall. Allison is sleeping in a\r\nlarge bed. Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nGraham, dressed in a black T-shirt and kaki short pants, enters\r\nthe room and sits on the bed. He takes Allison's leg through the\r\nbedcover. Allison stands up with a start.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Allie, I let you sleep.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       What time is it ?\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       About ten.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, my God\r\n\r\nAllison jumps from the bed in a hurry.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I've got a meeting. It's really important.\r\n\r\nGraham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room.\r\nNEW YORK - A BUSY STREET - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk. She comes to a shop\r\nand looks through the window. She combs her hair with her hand.\r\n\r\nA RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA nice restaurant in New-York. Paintings on the walls. Soft music.\r\nA waitress is talking on the phone. Allison enters the restaurant\r\nand crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting\r\nalone, stands up when she comes to him. The man is Mitchell\r\nMyerson, Allison's appointment.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hi !\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Hi !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm sorry, I'm a little late.\r\nThey shake hands.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       No, no, it's worth the wait.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thank you.\r\n\r\nThey sit down. The man takes his glass.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       So...\r\n\r\nA little later. They have finished their meal. Allison has put her\r\nlaptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard. On the\r\nscreen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing\r\ncolor and appearance each time Allison presses a key.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an\r\n       expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones'\r\n       software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Who do I get to run it ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the\r\n       quote.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Best for last.\r\n\r\nShe gives him a printed paper.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Here's where I was thinking of playing.\r\n\r\nHe takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document\r\nAllison gave him. Then he hands back the document to her. She\r\nreads it and seems surprised.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I\r\n       made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a\r\n       friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all\r\n       the credit and she didn't like me telling her so.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You\r\n       walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled\r\n       apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your\r\n       client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you\r\n       say you are.\r\n\r\nHe points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still\r\nholding.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       But that is the only way to prove it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I could go for something...\r\n\r\nThe waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final\r\n       offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about\r\n       it...\r\n\r\nAllison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       I look forward to it.\r\n\r\nThey shake hands.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door. She\r\ndrops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door. She goes\r\nto the answering machine, and presses a key.\r\n       THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       No messages.\r\n\r\nThe machine beeps.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison starts tearing the sheets off the bed. Her movements are\r\nvery nervous. And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less\r\nmattress and starts crying.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nWe hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image\r\nof Allison crying on her bed.\r\n\r\nAllison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a\r\ntable. We see washing machines working in the background.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       What is this ? A song cue ? \u00abYou're Nobody Till Somebody\r\n       Loves You.\u00bb\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying\r\n       those books like \u00abCooking for One\u00bb. It's just too\r\n       depressing.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       There are worse things than being on your own, you know.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do\r\n       with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy\r\n       interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a\r\n       career... or a guy to interfere with it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You'll find someone again.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I\r\n       don't.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I know that. I can do it on my own.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Absolutely.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'll just get a room-mate.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       You could always call him, Allie.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Not if I have a room-mate.\r\n\r\nCOMPUTER SCREEN\r\n\r\nAn Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac OS 7 or even Mac OS 6,\r\nsince the film was made in 1991/1992). The window is titled\r\n\u00abComlink Fax TM\u00bb. On the window itself we can read :\r\n\r\n       ATZ\r\n       OK\r\n       ENTER YOUR AD NOW\r\n       SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE APARTMENT IN W70S\r\n       NON-SMOKER PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED\r\n\r\nWhen we first see the computer screen, only \u00abSWF SEEKS FEMALE TO\r\nSH\u00bb is written. We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the\r\nrest of the ad is written. The computer screen fades into a\r\nnewspaper clip after \u00abPROFESSIONAL PREF\u00bb is written.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER CLIP\r\n\r\nWe see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted\r\nwith a felt-pen red rectangle. It says :\r\n\r\n       SWF seeks female to share\r\n       apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker\r\n       professional preferred. 555-9814\r\n\r\nAround this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or\r\nsharing.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       The managers couldn't really know you want to live there.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded\r\nnewspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is\r\nlying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone.\r\nAround her, we see other desks with people working.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't\r\n       come on the lease.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and\r\nwhite bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the\r\nkitchen. She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a\r\ntable. Behind Allison, a nice white stove. The butch girl is\r\ncarrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand. In the credits, the\r\nbutch girl is called \u00abMannish Applicant\u00bb\r\n\r\n       THE BUTCH GIRL\r\n       Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get\r\n       in here. Are you proper with tools ?\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves\r\naround the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye.\r\nAllison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the\r\ndeparting applicant with an amused eye.\r\n\r\nLater in the same room. Another applicant is walking around the\r\nroom. She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking. While\r\nshe is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera\r\nflashlight across the room.\r\n\r\n       TALKATIVE APPLICANT\r\n       I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the\r\n       instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have\r\n       the sense that I survived something. All my therapists\r\n       think so.\r\n\r\nShe goes out the room in the hall. Allison is shaking her head\r\nbehind her back.\r\n       TALKATIVE APPLICANT\r\n       Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning,\r\n       anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault.\r\n\r\nWhile the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing\r\nsomething on a pad she is holding in her left hand. Underneath the\r\npad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight\r\ncoming from.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch.\r\n\r\nA young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a\r\nwhite blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet... too\r\nperfect !\r\n\r\n       PERFECT APPLICANT\r\n       I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please\r\n       give me a call.\r\n\r\nAllison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera.\r\n\r\nLater. Close-up on the pile of application forms. On the top of\r\nthe pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her\r\npicture stapled in the left top corner of the form.\r\n\r\nAllison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files. She\r\nhas the file of the last woman in her hand. She stands up and\r\nwalks to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last\r\napplicant, whose form is still in her hand. Then she sees Sam's\r\npicture on the fridge door. She puts the form on the top of the\r\nfridge.\r\nClose-up of Sam's picture.\r\n\r\nAllison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n       SAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\r\n       Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ?\r\n\r\nAllison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. She sits down\r\non the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture. She crumples\r\nthe picture into a small tight ball.\r\n\r\nWe see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking\r\nin the hall. Allison is still crying.\r\n\r\nThe woman knocks on the kitchen wall. Allison stands up with a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh !... Hi !\r\n\r\nWe get a full view of the unknown visitor. It's Hedra Carlson. She\r\nis wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair. She is\r\ncarrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest. She looks\r\nvery sweet and nice.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison\r\n       Jones ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yes... I'm Allie.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning.\r\n\r\nShe looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Are you sure you're okay ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came\r\n       back tomorrow ?\r\n\r\nHedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Why don't you just... sit down.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, I'm fine.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'll make you some tea.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all.\r\nHedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...\r\n\r\nShe comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I use a wrench.\r\n\r\nShe squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag\r\non the floor. Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her\r\nwrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls.\r\n\r\nHedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink.\r\n\r\nThe girls are both all wet.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers\r\nnear the open window.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli.\r\n\r\nHedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa. Hedra is\r\nwearing a red T-shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from\r\nAllison.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, yes...\r\n\r\nAllison looks at the papers.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedra... that's unusual.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling\r\n       you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to\r\n       now, right ?\r\n\r\nWhile Allison is reading the documents Hedra gave her, Hedra feels\r\nthe clothes hanging by the window.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       They're dry.\r\nShe picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket\r\nto Allison\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Here.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thanks.\r\n\r\nSam's crumpled picture falls on the floor from a fold in the\r\njacket. Hedra picks it up\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's\r\n       the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh !...\r\n\r\nShe sits down on the sofa next to Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things\r\n       up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being\r\n       bound again, and then have things change. It would just be\r\n       awkward.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that\r\n       my faucets will work. When can you move in ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, really ?\r\n\r\nShe looks very moved by what Allison just said. She takes\r\nAllison's hand.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Congratulations.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Thank you.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison and Hedra are walking along a corridor in the basement.\r\nAllison is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and beige pants.\r\nHedra is wearing a red dress with white small dots. Allison is\r\ncarrying two suitcases and Hedra a very large box. They all must\r\nbe empty, the way the girls are carrying them.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       A friend ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real\r\n       friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with\r\n       privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door...\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No problem.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good\r\n       for you.\r\n\r\nThey've come to a row of stocking rooms, all protected by\r\npartition and doors covered with chicken wire. They look like\r\ncages, and that's exactly what the tenants call them. The two\r\ngirls drop their parcels on the floor. Allison takes a key out of\r\nher pocket to open the padlock of her own private \u00abcage\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Anyway.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Wow !\r\n\r\nHedra crosses the corridor. On the opposite side from the row of\r\n\u00abcages\u00bb, a door that says : \u00abIncinerator Room\u00bb and stuck on it, a\r\nsign that says \u00abUse prohibited by law\u00bb.\r\n\r\nBy this door, a pile of junks, probably left by a tenant. Hedra\r\npicks up an old rusty metal lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh.\r\n\r\nA few moments later. Allison has resumed her tour of the basement,\r\nwalking along the corridors. Hedra is carrying the metal lamp she\r\nfound. They pass by the Laundry Room, where we've seen Allison\r\nearlier chatting with Graham. Inside, a lady is working with her\r\nlaundry on a table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Laundry room.\r\n\r\nAnother corridor.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay\r\n       in the day, but, still, lock yourself in.\r\n\r\nHedra looks at a key she is holding.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       This one ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, that's mail key.\r\n\r\nThey've come to the elevator. An old machinery, enclosed in a\r\nchicken wire cage, is working with a loud noise. Allison presses\r\nthe switch of the elevator\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       This is creepy.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old.\r\n\r\nThe elevator door slides into the wall, and the two girls get in\r\nthe cabin. Allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin, but\r\nit does not want to slide back into closed position.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this\r\n       screwdriver.\r\n\r\nShe takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin. With it,\r\nshe works on the door lock, and succeeds in moving it.\r\n\r\nWhile she rolls the inner telescopic door shut, she discovers that\r\nanother tenant has come into the cabin behind their back. He\r\ndoesn't look very friendly, with his bow-tie and his small\r\nmustache. He is holding a newspaper.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Excuse me.\r\n\r\nWhen the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides\r\nautomatically into shut position.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe elevator is moving up.\r\n\r\n       THE TENANT\r\n       Which floor ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Eleven\r\n\r\nThe tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Fourteen, please.\r\n\r\nThe tenant presses another button. Hedra plays with her keys and\r\nsmiles to Allison.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison and Hedra move a table out of the room. The table is\r\ncovered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a\r\ndesk. When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they\r\nupset everything that is on the table down on the floor. They\r\nscream and laugh.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working\r\nperfectly.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\nHedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath\r\nthe sink. She stands up with an oval metal dish.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Look what I found.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in\r\nthe kitchen. It shines so well that she can look at herself in it\r\nas if it was a mirror.\r\n\r\nClose up on the dish. Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face\r\ncoming to join her.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.\r\n\r\nSitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has\r\nfound in the basement. An electric fan is working next to her.\r\nHedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie, it's Sam.\r\n\r\nAllison shakes her head \u00abNo\u00bb.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nNice weather. Busy street, with shops and people. Allison and\r\nHedra are walking, eating ice cream cones. Allison is very\r\nelegantly dressed. Hedra is more simply dressed and is still\r\nwearing her old black hat.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's\r\n       just so New York.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I think you look very comfortable.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah, I never know what looks good.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - A CLOTHES SHOP - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh !... I think that looks nice\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yes ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       But I found this.\r\n\r\nShe gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out\r\nof our view.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I think you'd look great with that.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay\r\n\r\nHedra takes the dress and looks at it.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - A SHOE SHOP - INTERIOR DAY\r\nWe see only Allison's feet and legs. She is sitting on a chair\r\ntrying on some high-heel shoes. We see Hedra's feet coming toward\r\nher. She is also wearing high-heel shoes.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey ! What do you think ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I think you should take them.\r\n\r\nAllison takes off the shoes she was trying on.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh God, you like them ?\r\n\r\nWe now see both girls' faces. Hedra is taking off the shoes she\r\nwas wearing.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I think they go great with that dress.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You take them\r\n\r\nShe gives her shoes to Allison.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well...\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'll just borrow them when I want to.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nA full view of Allison's building in the New-York night. Actually,\r\nit's not full night yet, because there is still some dark blue\r\nlight in the sky.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe room is all dark, lit only by the street light coming from the\r\nwindow. Allison walks into the room with a lampshade in her hand.\r\nShe puts the lampshade on the lamp by the bed. Then she switches\r\nthe lamp on. Apparently it is the lamp Hedra found in the\r\nbasement, cleaned and painted.\r\n\r\nAllison looks at the books on the night-table.\r\n\r\nShe then moves across the room, puts her handbag on the bed, and\r\ntakes a medicine bottle from a small table. She puts it back and\r\ntakes a perfume bottle. She takes the plug off and sniffs the\r\nbottle. With the plug, she puts a bit of perfume on her neck. She\r\nputs the plug back on the bottle and the bottle back on the table.\r\nShe then takes a pair of earring from the table. She holds them on\r\nher ears and looks at the effect in a mirror.\r\n\r\nIn the mirror, we see Hedra entering the room behind Allison.\r\nAllison turns quickly around. Hedra is wearing a light night-robe\r\nand her hair is wet\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       God! I didn't know you were home. I was...\r\n\r\nLying on the bed, there are a shoebox with a rubber band around\r\nit, a key on a keyring, and a piece of paper. Apparently, Allison\r\nhas not noticed them. Quickly, Hedra throw the bath-towel, she is\r\nholding, on those items, for Allison not to notice them.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been\r\n       here two weeks and I'm already in your room.\r\n       (ironically)\r\n       I was just about to go through your drawers !\r\n\r\nHedra laughs. Allison puts the earrings, she was still holding,\r\nback on the table.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       That smells nice on you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try\r\n       that.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh God, no. anything you want... you want.\r\n\r\nShe takes her night-robe off. Allison seems embarrassed to see her\r\nnaked. She turns her eyes away from her.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Go ahead. Share and share alike.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child.\r\n       Do you have... a big family ?\r\n\r\nHedra puts her nightdress on.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hu-uh... There's just me.\r\n\r\nShe sits on her bed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was\r\n       stillborn.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, that's so sad.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I grew up like a part of me was missing.\r\n\r\nShe turns around sees the new lampshade.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ! God !\r\n\r\nShe stands up to have a better look at the lampshade.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you ?\r\n\r\nShe walks toward the little table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like\r\n       that.\r\n\r\nHedra picks up the earrings from the table, and gives them to\r\nAllison\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh no no...\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Shhh !...\r\n\r\nShe puts the earrings on Allison's ears.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       They look beautiful on you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       But I can't take these.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It's housewarming.\r\n\r\nAllison looks at herself in the mirror.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thanks, they're great.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Excuse me.\r\n\r\nShe goes out of the room. While going out, she bumps into Hedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oops !\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison picks up the phone.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hello ?...\r\n\r\nIt's Sam. We only hear a few words of what he says.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over on the phone)\r\n       ... Talk to me...\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, Sam.\r\n          SAM (voice over on the phone)\r\n          Why not ?... Why not ?...\r\n\r\n          ALLISON\r\n          No, it's not a good time.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra takes the shoebox from her bed, goes to a closet inserted in\r\nthe wall of the bedroom, and puts the shoebox on the top shelf of\r\nthe closet.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON (voice over from the corridor)\r\n          I'm not ready to see you. You're just going on something\r\n          that's over.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is still on the phone.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON\r\n          No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's\r\n          somebody here right now...\r\n\r\nWe see Hedra's face peeking through the door of her bedroom.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON\r\n          All right ?... Okay... Bye.\r\n\r\nShe puts the phone down. Hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n          HEDRA\r\n          Why don't we order some Chinese ?\r\n\r\nAllison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the\r\ntelephone, and then smiles and shakes her head \u00abYes\u00bb.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by\r\nthe bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings. Hedra rushes out of the bathroom. She is wearing\r\na orange T-shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers.\r\n\r\n          ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n          Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank\r\n          you.\r\n\r\nA beep.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the\r\ntelephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts\r\nthe box back on the table\r\n\r\n          SAM'S VOICE ON   THE ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n          Allie, are you   there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen.\r\n          Please, please   call me back. This is torture for me. I know\r\n          you need me as   much as I need you. I love you. I'll do\r\n       anything for you for us to get back together, just call me.\r\n\r\nA click, meaning the end of the call. Hedra presses a button on\r\nthe answering machine, to erase Sam's message.\r\n\r\nWe hear some yapping coming from the bathroom. Hedra turns her\r\nhead toward the bathroom.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Buddy !\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose-up shot of Hedra, kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big\r\npuppy in her arms. She is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from\r\nthe bath.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her\r\n       up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll\r\n       let you stay.\r\n\r\nWhile rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it.\r\n\r\nShe hears the front door opening and turns her head around. She\r\nsays \u00abShhh !\u00bb to the puppy, and whispers some other\r\nincomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub.\r\n\r\nClose-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring. The\r\npaper is a bill from a shop called \u00abPet Express\u00bb, in New-York. It\r\nwas paid in cash, and the date is 8/16. It reads :\r\n\r\n       YELLOW LAB PUPPY\r\n          MALE, 6 WEEKS OLD, $ 350,-\r\n                           TAX $ 29,75\r\n                           $ 379,75\r\n\r\nHedra's hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste-basket\r\nunderneath the other items already in the basket.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison enters the apartment. She is wearing a silver-colored\r\nraincoat.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yoo-hoo !\r\n\r\nShe closes the front door. Through the open bathroom door, we see\r\nHedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub. She takes a\r\ntowel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub.\r\n\r\nAllison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag\r\non the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine. A\r\nbeep and then :\r\n\r\n       ANSWERING MACHINE\r\n       No messages.\r\n\r\nBehind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the\r\npuppy wrapped in the towel.\r\n\r\nAllison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her\r\ntracks. She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him\r\n       away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back\r\n       to-morrow.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I hope they meant it.\r\n\r\nHedra sits down on the floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I\r\n       was little.\r\n\r\nShe gives a kiss to the puppy. She then looks up at Allison's\r\nface, which doesn't seem very friendly.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Tomorrow, okay. I promise.\r\n\r\nAllison walks away taking off her raincoat.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nWe hear the puppy yapping. Hedra is sitting on her bed in the\r\ndark. She stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up at Hedra's peeking through the ajar opening of the door.\r\nThe puppy is still yapping.\r\nThe door of Allison's bedroom opens and Allison comes out. She is\r\nwearing a light pink nightdress.\r\n\r\nShe slowly opens the kitchen door, bends down and picks up the\r\npuppy.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh ! Come on.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot of Allison picking up the puppy. She then goes\r\naway, presumably to her bedroom, with the puppy in her arms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay. Come on. Shhh !\r\n\r\nThrough the open kitchen door, we see, across the corridor,\r\nHedra's bedroom door closing itself.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nHedra, wearing pajama-looking pants and a sleeveless loose shirt,\r\ncomes in the room, carrying a tray. There is a mug on the tray, in\r\nwhich Hedra is pouring honey from a plastic bottle. She comes to a\r\ntable, where Allison is working on two computers. The puppy is\r\nsitting on Allison's laps.\r\n\r\nHedra stirs the mug with a teaspoon, and puts the tray on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You're working so hard.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the screens of the computers. They show women dresses\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Myerson better refers some clients to me.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       He will, you're the best.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra and Allison are lying on Allison's bed, with the puppy\r\nbetween them. Hedra is wearing a pink T-shirt and red short pants.\r\nThe TV is on and we hear its sound faintly, without really\r\nunderstanding the words.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       God, Hedy, thanks. I never would've got it done without\r\n       you.\r\n\r\nHedra is playing with a portable battery-powered fan. She puts it\r\ndown to play with the puppy.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I love helping.\r\nShe tries to move the puppy, who wants to move the other way.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Wait... Wait...\r\n\r\nAllison takes her Polaroid camera to take a shot of the three of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh yeah ! Family portrait.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Ready ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah.\r\n\r\nAllison takes the snapshot.\r\n\r\nLater in the night. There is a black and white movie on the TV.\r\n\r\n       THE WOMAN IN THE FILM ON TV\r\n       I lived a few weeks while you loved me. Goodbye, David.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves away from the TV, and we see Allison and Hedra\r\nasleep on Allison's bed, with the puppy between them. Hedra moves\r\nslightly in her sleep.\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison and Graham are walking on the sidewalk of the street,\r\nGraham pushing his bicycle. He has a canvas bag strapped over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nGraham's first sentence is actually heard in voice over the\r\nprevious sequence.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Ready to kill her yet ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Who, Hedy ?\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Hm-mm !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       I can tell. I was worried for a while that you were so\r\n       down. You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThey enter the lobby. We can see that Allison is carrying some\r\nshopping bags. A lady is going out with a dog on a leash.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You were great, Graham. I just had to spend some time with\r\n       her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been\r\n       working like crazy. I promised I'm not avoiding you.\r\n\r\nThey enter the elevator. Two ladies are coming out. Allison has to\r\nuse the screwdriver to close the inner door of the cabin.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Oh, I've got you cornered now. I've been meaning to come\r\n       down and see you. I was on my way to ask you something.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe cabin is moving up.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Will you cat sit again ? I have to go to Boston this week-\r\n       end for my cousin's wedding.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Fine. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.\r\n\r\nHe takes a keyring out of his pocket.\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Hey, I've made you a set. You know which one to try. And\r\n       ignore the litter box this time, I do.\r\n\r\nShe laughs.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's so cruel. We'll be fine.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       You know, I think I saw her the other day, your room-mate.\r\n       You were leaving the building. Then I thought it was you.\r\n       Your backpack. This jacket. I chased her down. But it was\r\n       someone else. Someone very nervous.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people\r\n       knowing she's living in the building. I would've had you\r\n       down to meet her... but she's shy.\r\n\r\nThe elevator stops.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well.\r\n\r\nThe outer door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping\r\nbags. She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving\r\nher.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Friday ?\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back.\r\n\r\nAllison closes the inner door.\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot of Allison closing the elevator inner door. The\r\nouter door closes automatically. Allison walks along the hall\r\ntoward her apartment.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe front door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping\r\nbags and enters the apartment. The front door closes behind her.\r\nShe drops her keys on the little shelf by the door. She sees Hedra\r\nin the doorway of the living room. Her hair is in a bun.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hey, I thought you'd be at work.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Don't tell me we have the same belt.\r\nHedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, they're great.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I had to get them. They're so great.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Can I just talk to you for a second...\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Buddy !\r\n\r\nSam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I tried to let you know.\r\n\r\nSam puts the puppy on the floor.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       What are you doing here ? Hedy !\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay.\r\n\r\nHedra goes out of the hall into the living room.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you.\r\nHedra comes back in the hall.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me...\r\n\r\nShe looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a \u00abNo\u00bb\r\nhead-shake as an answer from Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\nHedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Why can't you just leave me alone ?\r\n\r\nAllison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I\r\n       don't exist.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison puts her bags down on a table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it\r\n       easier on me ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was\r\n       wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You\r\n       don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would\r\n       I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ?\r\n       Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you\r\n       just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't\r\n       one of them.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I\r\n       wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just\r\n       didn't get it.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Well, I sent it with the keys.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you.\r\n       I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me\r\n       a second chance.\r\n\r\nShe goes into his arms. He hugs her. She start crying.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You really hurt me, Sam.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Shhh !\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose-up on Allison's kitchen window.

She\r\nseems very pensive.\r\n\r\nAn old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra.\r\nHedra turns her head toward the lady. She picks up her bag, which\r\nwas sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the\r\nwindow. She goes to the elevator and presses the call button.\r\n\r\nA STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nWe are across the street from the Rizzoli bookshop, the shop where\r\nHedra is working.\r\n\r\nRIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra, dressed exactly like she was in the previous sequence, is\r\ndialing a number on the telephone on the wall.\r\n\r\nA lady comes to her.\r\n\r\n          THE LADY CUSTOMER\r\n          Excuse me, can you tell me where the biography section is ?\r\n\r\n          HEDRA\r\n          Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall.\r\n\r\n          THE LADY CUSTOMER\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\nThe lady moves away from Hedra.\r\n\r\nWe hear Allison's answering machine talking in the telephone.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON'S ANSWERING MACHINE (voice over)\r\n          Hi, this is Allison Jones.

Some\r\npieces of clothing are already on the floor, and we see Allison's\r\nfoot stroking the back of Sam's leg.\r\n\r\n          HEDRA (voice over on the answering machine)\r\n          Call me at work. Yeah. Okay. My number's on the fridge.\r\n          Okay, bye.\r\n\r\nRIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra puts the phone back on its hook. She seems very nervous.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe Atherton Hotel is evidently a quite luxurious hotel.\r\n\r\nSam and Allison are walking on the sidewalk towards us and the\r\nentrance of the hotel.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Say... Next month, that would give her enough time.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do.\r\n       I'm sure she'll understand.\r\n\r\nThey enter the hotel.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam and Allison cross the lobby, hand in hand.\r\n\r\nAn old hotel clerk looks at them from behind his counter.\r\n\r\n       HOTEL CLERK\r\n       Good evening, Mister Rawson.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on the TV set showing a movie featuring James Stewart.\r\n\r\n       JAMES STEWART (playing his character in the movie)\r\n       I have an idea I must be in love with you.

On the floor beside her, the puppy is playing with a\r\ntennis shoes. Hedra looks down at it and kicks it away with one of\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey ! It's not for you !\r\n\r\nThe puppy goes away yapping. Hedra has a mean look on her face.\r\n       JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       Would you like it to go on for always ?\r\n\r\n       FEMALE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       How does anything go on for always ?\r\n\r\n       JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       Well, one likes to think some things do.\r\n\r\nHedra keeps on eating her ice-cream, looking absently at the TV,\r\nwith the same mean look on her face.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam is sitting on a chair, naked. Allison, also naked, is sitting\r\non his laps, facing him, and with her legs spread on either side\r\nof the chair. She is moving up an down.

She is wearing her\r\nengagement ring.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra is lying naked in the bath.

Sam goes back\r\ninto the cab.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe front door opens. Allison comes in and closes the door behind\r\nher. She locks the door and puts the security chain on. She puts\r\nher keys on the shelf by the door, and looks through her mail. She\r\nstops near Hedra's bedroom closed door, because she notices there\r\nis still some light in the room. She then goes to the telephone\r\ntable to look at the answering machine.\r\n\r\nStill looking through her mail, she enters her bedroom.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nWithout switching the lights on, Allison puts her mail on a chest\r\nof drawers.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Where the hell have you been ?\r\nAllison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the\r\nbed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs\r\ncovered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing\r\nher night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from\r\n       you.

You're\r\n       making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here.\r\n\r\nShe goes to the bed where Hedra is stroking absently the puppy.\r\nShe kneels down at the bedside.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hey, are you okay ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched\r\n       things up with Sam, huh ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer.\r\n\r\nHedra looks down at Allison hand stroking the puppy.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Is that an engagement ring ?\r\n\r\nAllison stands up.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Right.\r\n\r\nHedra sighs, and moves the sheet away to get out of the bed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Beautiful ring.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thanks.\r\n\r\nHedra walks away from the bed. She gives a last look at Allison's\r\nring.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Really great.\r\nShe walks to the door.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and\r\n       I'll be alone.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean,\r\n       God, if I can...\r\n\r\nHedra is standing in the doorway and points to the mirror.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look !\r\n\r\nShe comes back into the bedroom. She forces Allison to look at\r\nboth of them in the mirror.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have\r\n       this great personality. You have this great style. You're\r\n       running your own business. You're always going to find\r\n       someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you\r\n       wouldn't.\r\n\r\nShe puts her head in her hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So...\r\n       I have to move out, right ?... No ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I\r\n       know you just spent a lot on furniture.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You\r\n       promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what...\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam.\r\n       Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll\r\n       find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll\r\n       see, we'll figure something out. Okay ?\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nFontana Fashions is Mitchell Myerson's company.\r\n\r\nClose-up on some feminine hands typing on an Apple computer\r\nkeyboard. We see various windows, showing models of female dress,\r\nopening and closing on the screen.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       They tell me they're nervous.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Of course, they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to\r\n       be sold.\r\nWe see the whole room. It is a very big room with large white\r\ncolumns supporting the ceiling, and large bay windows.\r\n\r\nGirls are working in the background. Some are trying a new dress\r\non a model girl. Mitchell's assistant is typing on the computer,\r\nwith Allison standing near her. Her name is Barbara, and she is a\r\nwoman with brown hair and a sleek bob haircut. Mitchell is\r\nstanding a couple of feet away.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something\r\n       special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you\r\n       know. Open bar, open minds. That's \u00abF\u00bb night.\r\n\r\nMitchell walks to the desk next to Barbara's one, where he starts\r\nflipping the cards of a Rolodex.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you\r\n       tonight after I check on some things.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Great.\r\n\r\nHe takes a card from the Rolodex.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       \u00ab8796, Knox\u00bb. Knox ? What's this Knox ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That\r\n       was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, maybe you start spreading the word.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you\r\n       any more.\r\n\r\nHe puts his hand on Allison's shoulder and walks away. Allison\r\nsmiles and then looks at what Barbara is doing.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Great. Press \u00abenter\u00bb. That's it.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nLow angle shot of Allison's building.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nIn the dark, we see the shadow of Allison moving up and down on\r\ntop of Sam. She is slightly moaning.\r\n\r\nFade out.\r\nLater. Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, naked and half-\r\ncovered by the sheet. Allison's head is resting on Sam's chest.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You thirsty ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       No.\r\n\r\nShe starts moving out of the bed.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'll be right back, okay.\r\n\r\nShe stands up and puts a light night-gown on. She walks out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is filling a tooth glass from the tap of the sink.\r\nSuddenly we hear voices. Allison seems surprised. We don't\r\nunderstand the words, but we recognize Sam's voice, and then\r\nHedra's light laugh.\r\n\r\nAllison slowly walks out, carrying her glass.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra is standing at the door of Allison's bedroom. She is holding\r\na glass containing an orange liquid. She is wearing a night gown\r\nand she is holding a book in her other hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, you'd know more about that than I would.\r\n\r\nShe laughs.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe lights are switched on in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nSam is lying in the bed, still half-covered by the sheet. He is\r\ndrinking from a can.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot of Hedra drinking from her glass. The night-\r\ngown is slightly open and we can see that she is just wearing\r\npanties underneath.\r\n\r\nAllison walks behind Hedra. She is holding her tooth glass, and\r\nwith her other hand, she keeps her night gown well closed. Hedra\r\nturns her head towards her.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, hi !\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over from the bed)\r\n       Allie, do you want a sip ?\r\n\r\nAllison shows her own glass in her hand without answering.\r\nHedra looks at Sam and then at Allison. She seems slightly\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh well... Well I think I'll turn in. Goodnight, Allie.\r\n\r\nShe kisses Allison's cheek.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Goodnight, Sam.\r\n\r\nShe walks away toward her bedroom.\r\n\r\nSam turns himself around in the bed to lie on his back.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the door, Allison switches the lights off.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the room, the puppy is wide awake and is sitting in\r\nhis basket.\r\n\r\nAllison lies down on the bed. She hasn't taken her night gown off.\r\nClose up shot on Allison's face lying on her back on the bed. She\r\nseems worried.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot of the fan spinning on the ceiling.\r\n\r\nFade-out.\r\n\r\nLater. Allison is asleep, lying on her side. She is still wearing\r\nher night-gown. Her hand is moving on the sheet, and apparently\r\ndoes not find what it was looking for, because Allison suddenly\r\nsits up on the bed.\r\n\r\nWe see Sam sleeping and lying on his back, half-covered by the\r\nsheet. Allison looks at him and sighs.\r\n\r\nWe hear some strange noises. Allison gets up and off the bed.\r\n\r\nWe see her naked feet walking past the puppy's basket. Allison\r\nopens the door. The puppy leaves his basket and follows her.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison crosses the hall, followed by the puppy. She stops, bends\r\ndown and picks it up.\r\n\r\nShe walks slowly to Hedra's door, which is partly opened. We hear\r\nHedra moaning.\r\n\r\nIn the mirror on the closet door, we see Hedra lying on her\r\nstomach on her bed, half-covered by the sheet. She is\r\nmasturbating. She turns around to lie on her back.\r\n\r\nClose up shot on Allison's face looking at Hedra. She seems half-\r\nsurprised, half-fascinated by what she sees.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\nHedra is lying on her back in her bed. Her sheet is down to her\r\nwaist, showing her breasts. She still has one hand between her\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThe puppy yaps.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up of Allison's face, looking slightly frightened. She puts\r\nthe puppy on the floor.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the mirror in Hedra's bedroom. We see Hedra\r\nsitting up on her bed.\r\n\r\nAllison runs through the hall towards her bedroom. The puppy\r\nfollows her, but she shuts the door before it can gets in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison jumps into her bed and lies down. We can hear the puppy\r\nyapping behind the door.\r\nAllison hears the door opening. She puts her head on the pillow,\r\ncloses her eyes and pretends she is asleep.\r\n\r\nHedra walks slowly across the room towards the bed. She is wearing\r\nher night gown.\r\n\r\nWe see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she\r\nwas really asleep.\r\n\r\nHedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts\r\nwalking back towards the door.\r\n\r\nClose-up shot on Allison's face. Her eyes are closed, but, when\r\nshe hears the door closing, she opens them again.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nSam is fixing a broken piece of wrought iron on the balustrade on\r\nthe balcony. He is screwing a sleeve clamp to fix the broken piece\r\non the main body of the balustrade.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       They're ready.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Right, just a minute.\r\n\r\nHedra is coming out of the kitchen with a frying pan. She is just\r\nwearing her night gown. She is stirring some scrambled eggs in the\r\npan.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       They'll get cold.\r\n\r\nShe eats a piece of crispy bacon out of the pan.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       All right, all right.\r\n\r\nSam climbs out of the balcony.\r\n\r\nA wider shot shows Hedra back in the kitchen, cooking something on\r\nthe stove. Sam slides the window down, and then walks across the\r\nroom and into the kitchen. The puppy gets out of its basket and\r\nfollows him.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison gets out of her bedroom, fully dressed and ready to go to\r\nwork. She hears voices coming out of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       No, no, Rawson is a Norse name.\r\n\r\nAllison opens the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nSam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the\r\nsmall kitchen table. The puppy is eating something off the floor.\r\n\r\n       SAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over\r\n       while Allison was opening the door)\r\n       Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation.\r\n\r\nHe looks up at Allison entering the room\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Hey !\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hi !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       We going ?\r\n\r\nShe walks to the sink, and picks up an orange. Sam gives her a\r\nkiss on the cheek. She turns her head and doesn't respond to the\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nHedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand. She gives the\r\nplate to Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Scrambled or fried ?\r\n\r\nAllison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange. She seems\r\nquite upset.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (whispering)\r\n       This is fine.\r\n\r\nShe gets out of the kitchen. Sam turns his head towards Hedra and\r\nthen follows Allison.\r\n\r\nHedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to\r\nthe conversation going on in the living room\r\n       SAM (voice over)\r\n       Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if\r\n       you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can\r\n       wait till I get back.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra is standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen, with the\r\nplate still in her hand.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the legs of Allison and Sam.

Drive to Box Camp ?\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Hedra bending down and slapping her thigh.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Buddy, come here, boy.\r\nShe takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the\r\npuppy.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Allison and Sam.\r\n\r\nThe puppy doesn't respond at all to Hedra's call and food.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Come on, three's a crowd, sweetie.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       All right, Hedy, he's fine.\r\n       (in a much lower voice, for Sam's ears only)\r\n       Poor guy's doesn't who's who anymore.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Hedra standing up and finishing her plate.\r\n\r\nThen reverse angle shot again on Allison and Sam.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a\r\n       car...\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good\r\n       sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ?\r\n\r\nSam gives her a very tender kiss, which she gives him back.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Hedra looking very angry. She goes back into\r\nthe kitchen and puts her plate down. She then walks into the\r\nliving room, looking very casual.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.\r\n\r\nShe gives a light tap on Sam's back when she walks behind him. She\r\ntakes a food plate off Allison's desk, and starts walking away\r\ntowards the kitchen with the plate.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough\r\n       already.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.\r\n\r\nShe enters the kitchen to put the plate down. She then comes back\r\ninto the living room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust\r\n       me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think\r\n       we'll be eating out.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck.\r\nWe can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about\r\nwhat she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face.\r\n\r\nSam and Allison walks out of the room.\r\n\r\nHedra wrinkles the front of her night gown with her nervous hands.\r\nShe walks slowly toward the hall.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nSam and Allison are going out of the apartment.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Goodbye.\r\n\r\nSam closes the door behind them. The puppy remains behind the\r\ndoor, whining.\r\n\r\nHedra sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall near the door of\r\nthe living room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Buddy, come here.\r\n\r\nShe taps her hand on the floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Come here, sweetie.\r\n\r\nThe puppy doesn't move away from the front door, and keeps on\r\nyapping and crying.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I know... I know.\r\n\r\nShe seems very nervous. The dog keeps on yapping at the door.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Buddy, come !\r\n\r\nShe taps her hand on the floor in a more and more nervous way.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (angry voice)\r\n       Come !\r\n\r\nThe dog doesn't move from the door, and keeps on yapping.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (calmer voice)\r\n       Fine.\r\n\r\nAN EMPTY APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA large room in a typical old New-York apartment. Large windows\r\ngoing almost to the ceiling. Through the windows we see roofs with\r\nwater tanks on them. The room is empty, save for a ladder and a\r\nfew tools.\r\n\r\nThe real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand.\r\nSam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n        SAM\r\n        But this is half the size for twice the price from your\r\n        apartment.\r\n\r\n        ALLISON\r\n        It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice.\r\n\r\nThey walk away toward the exit of the apartment. The agent remains\r\nstanding on the same spot.\r\n\r\n        SAM\r\n        Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - A STREET NEAR ALLISON'S PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nA busy street in New York, with small shops with goods for sale on\r\ncounters on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nSam and Allison are walking down the street.\r\n\r\n        SAM\r\n        Do you think we can smoke her out ?\r\n\r\n        ALLISON\r\n        This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think\r\n        I'm her only friend.\r\n\r\nThey turn the corner of the street, and we hear a scream. Sam and\r\nAllison both lift their heads.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nLow angle shot taken from ground level showing a woman running on\r\nher balcony.

We see Hedra sitting at the\r\nkitchen table. She stands up when she sees Allison.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison stops in front of the window. The window is open and the\r\nbroken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in\r\nthe morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap\r\nwide enough for a puppy dog to go through.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (screaming and crying)\r\n       He's dead ! Buddy's dead !\r\n\r\nSam climbs on the balcony.\r\n\r\nClose up on the gap in the balustrade.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\nHedra seems genuinely surprised. She still has the earphones of\r\nher Walkman around her neck.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (crying)\r\n       You left the window open. How could you do that ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it\r\n       this morning.\r\n\r\nSam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       I thought I did.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It's me.

Then she starts crying\r\nfor real.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ?\r\n\r\nSam kneels down.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Shh !\r\n\r\nSam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying. He slowly\r\nstands up, still holding her in his arms. He leads her to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nOutside Hedra's room. Sam is in the doorway. Hedra moves slightly\r\naway from him and then hugs him even stronger.\r\n\r\nGently, he pushes her away from him. They almost kiss on the\r\nmouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her\r\nroom, where she stays. He closes the door behind him, and she\r\nholds his hand on the doorknob. Then she moves her hand away and\r\nthe door closes. We hear her sobbing behind the closed door.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and\r\nblack panty hoses.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings. Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still\r\nclosed, feels around on the night table to find the phone. She\r\neventually picks it up.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hello ?... Hi, Mitch...\r\n\r\nShe raises her head.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\nShe looks at the clock.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       God ! I know... I'm... No, I'm just... I'm just running a\r\n       little late.\r\n\r\nShe picks up the pill bottle on the night table and looks at it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I didn't forget. I dunno... Just hold them till five,\r\n       okay ? Thanks.\r\n\r\nShe puts the phone down.\r\n\r\nShe gets up and goes into the dressing room. She starts looking\r\nfor a dress. She rapidly goes out.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Allison looking for\r\na dress.\r\n\r\nShe then goes out of the bathroom, crosses the hall and open a\r\ncloset, in which more clothes are hanging. She picks up three\r\nhangers with clothes on them.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nShe enters her bedroom, carrying the hangers. She throws one of\r\nthem on the bed, and goes, with the two other ones, back into the\r\ndressing room. She picks up a hanger with a light brown jacket,\r\nand compares it with the one on the hanger she brought from the\r\ncloset in the hall. They are exactly the same. Then she picks up a\r\nred dress, and compares it with the one she brought from the\r\ncloset in the hall. They're both the same. She looks a bit worried\r\nby what she just discovered.\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose-up on an Apple Computer screen, showing dress models. The\r\nfile is called \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       You were terrific...\r\n\r\nWe see Mitchell, very smartly dressed, with a white Roman-collar\r\nshirt and a black jacket. He is holding a glass of Champagne.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       ...but you know that, don't you ?\r\n\r\nA large section of the main hall of Fontana Fashions Office has\r\nbeen transformed into a reception room. Dresses are hanging on\r\nracks. On a round table with a white tablecloth, many half-empty\r\nglasses of Champagne, two silver bucket with Champagne bottles in\r\nthem, plates of \u00abpetit fours\u00bb, and a lot of flowers.\r\n\r\nMitchell and Allison are both standing in front of a large TV\r\nscreen, set on a hight stand, and showing the \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb\r\ncomputer files.\r\n\r\nAllison, wearing a very smart black short sleeveless dress, puts a\r\nvideo cassette back in its box.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thank you.\r\n\r\nMitchell goes to the table, puts his glass down, and fill another\r\nglass with Champagne.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       And here, I thought all the guys would resist you. As if\r\n       anyone ever could.\r\n\r\nHe gives the glass to Allison, who doesn't take it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh no, here, I've got to go. I'm just cleaning a bit.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Hold it. Hold it. Not so fast. Now everybody under me knows\r\n       more than I do. I hate that.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well... Block up some time for me next week. Then... it's\r\n       just a little late tonight.\r\n\r\nMitchell kneels down on the floor.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Oh, please, please, just a taste.\r\n\r\nHe puts the glass on the top of his head\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Something simple. Right now.\r\n\r\nHe gives the glass to Allison, who takes it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay... Something simple.\r\n\r\nShe walks to a table with an Apple computer on it, puts her glass\r\non the table, and sits down. Mitchell comes behind her, drinking\r\nhis glass, which he then puts on the table. He bends down behind\r\nAllison, who starts typing on the keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff,\r\n       but it does come in handy.\r\nClose-up on the computer screen. The \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb file is\r\non. We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on\r\nthe model. It says \u00abAre you sure you want to quit ?\u00bb and below two\r\nchoices, \u00abCancel\u00bb or \u00abOK\u00bb. Allison chooses \u00abOK\u00bb. \u00abFontana\r\nFashions\u00bb file disappears, replaced by another window that says\r\n\u00abSearch by vendor\u00bb, and in the bottom of the window, \u00abEnter Vendor\r\nName:\u00bb, with an empty box underneath.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       Huh-huh.\r\n\r\nBack to Allison typing. Mitchell's head is just behind hers.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay. Enter the vendor's name.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Oh !... Vendor...\r\n\r\nHe bends over Allison to type on the keyboard, encircling her with\r\nhis right arm.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       J-o-n-e-s... All..i...son.\r\n\r\nAllison seems a bit embarrassed by this close physical contact.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Very good.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the screen, where a new window titled \u00abAcc. Payable -\r\nSummary\u00bb. In the window, a data chart that reads as follows :\r\n\r\nCOMPANY: Concept Software CONTACT: Jones, Allison tel:212-555-9814\r\n                          Payment History\r\n\r\n    contract price:            $16,000.00\r\n    payments to date:          2\r\n    balance outstanding:       4,500.00\r\n                                          15-Jul-91     $7,000.00\r\n                                           1-Aug-91     $4,500.00\r\n    last paymt. sent:            1-Aug-91\r\n    next paymt. due:           15-Aug-91 ***PAYMENT PAST DUE***\r\n\r\n    no more records\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       See, here you go. \u00abContract price\u00bb, \u00abPayments to date\u00bb,\r\n       \u00abBalance outstanding\u00bb.\r\n\r\nBack to Allison and Mitchell looking at the screen\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last\r\n       Friday.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       That's all right. Barbara will handle that.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Not till I give her the word.\r\n\r\nAllison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       So far.\r\n\r\nHe walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a\r\n       little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now,\r\n       if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues.\r\n\r\nUsing a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out\r\nof its bucket.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself.\r\n\r\nHe throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison\r\nwith the bottle of Champagne. He puts the bottom of the bottle on\r\nAllison's bare shoulders. She shivers.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Top her ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       What are you doing ?\r\n\r\nHe puts his other hand on her shoulder. Then he puts the bottle on\r\nthe table, and starts massaging her shoulders.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       That's just that you're so tight.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.\r\n\r\nHe grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Mitch...\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Hey, look...\r\n\r\nHe kisses her neck.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good\r\n       girl. We have nothing to prove any more.\r\n\r\nHe keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress\r\nto reach her breast. Allison seems to be on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       This is your last chance to play before you're an old\r\n       married lady.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Let me turn around, okay ?\r\n\r\nShe has a strange smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       That's better. That's better.\r\n\r\nHe stands up.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Just a second... A second...\r\n\r\nWhile she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts\r\nunzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his\r\nwhite trunks.\r\n\r\nAllison, still   seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of\r\nhis crotch. He   takes her head to guide it toward his private\r\nparts. Allison   looks up at him and then, with both fists and all\r\nher might, she   hits him very hard between his legs. He screams.\r\n\r\nShe jumps from her seat and runs out of the room.\r\n\r\nHe falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Fucking bitch !\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Here. Take this.\r\n\r\nWe see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison. She then\r\nreplaces the glass of wine by a glass of water.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so\r\n       humiliating.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't\r\n       care how nice they seem. You always fall for that.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       But what I did... It was like something inside taking over.\r\n       It was scary.\r\n\r\nWe see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece. She is wearing an\r\norange T-shirt and a red skirt.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He\r\n       should pay for this.\r\n\r\nShe kneels on the floor in front of Allison.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to\r\n       eventually.\r\n\r\nHedra laughs.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking\r\n       about getting even.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the\r\n       money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and\r\n       now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square\r\n       one.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       What can I do ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, Allie...\r\n\r\nShe opens Allison's purse and takes her address-book.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How\r\n       he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died.\r\n\r\nShe walks to the telephone table in the hall, flipping the pages\r\nof the address-book.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Especially when it was his fault.\r\n\r\nSince the bedroom door is wide open, we can see Hedra in the hall.\r\nShe picks up the phone and starts dialing.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Who are you calling ?\r\n\r\nShe gets up from the sofa on which she was sitting.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll\r\n       take the call.\r\n\r\nAllison has come to the telephone table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Who are you talking ?\r\nHedra shushes Allison with her finger.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your\r\n       business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If\r\n       you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is\r\n       fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you.\r\n\r\nShe puts the phone down, and starts laughing.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHigh-angle shot of the building, taken from the roof of the\r\nbuilding across the street. We see Allison and Hedra coming out of\r\nthe building. From this height, they look like a couple of ants !\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy, we really have to talk.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Allie, please, I have a surprise for you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy !\r\n\r\nA STREET OUTSIDE JOHN DELLAR'S HAIR SALON - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison and Hedra are walking on the sidewalk. They stop in front\r\nof the shop of \u00abJohn Dellar's Hair Salon\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\nShe puts her hand on Allison's neck.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel\r\n       better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go.\r\n\r\nShe takes Allison by the hand and drags her to the door of the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Let's go.\r\n\r\nAllison tries to resist Hedra.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, Hedy.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It'll be fine, come on.\r\n\r\nThey enter the shop.\r\n\r\nJOHN DELLAR HAIR SALON - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is seated in front of a large mirror. An attendant is\r\ntaking the protection garment off her shoulders.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thank you.\r\n\r\nShe smiles. She seems happy and puts her hands through her hair.\r\nSuddenly she stops, and the smile disappears from her mouth. She\r\nlooks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the\r\nupper level of the shop. She makes the swivel chair turn around to\r\nhave a better look at the staircase.\r\n\r\nClose-up on Hedra going down the stair. Her hairdo is so much like\r\nAllison's one that she almost looks like a twin sister of Allison.\r\n\r\nBack to Allison's thunderstruck face.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You've got to be kidding.\r\n\r\nA STREET - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison and Hedra are walking in a busy street. If Hedra was not a\r\nbit shorter than Allison, one could think they were twins. Allison\r\nseems angry.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You just should've asked first.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.\r\nThey stop at a newspaper stand.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Can I have the Consumer Market, please.\r\n\r\n       NEWSPAPER STAND ATTENDANT\r\n       Sure.\r\n\r\nThe attendant picks up a magazine from a rack and Allison picks up\r\nsome other magazines at random.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind.\r\n\r\nAllison is paying the attendant.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thank you... please.\r\n\r\nHedra seems to be worried by Allison's very cold reaction to her\r\n\u00absurprise\u00bb. She seems even a bit sad.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       I'm going to take a shower.\r\n\r\nAllison walks out of her room into the hall.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra turing the\r\nwater faucet on in the shower cubicle, then taking her belt off.\r\nShe closes the door of the bathroom.\r\n\r\nAllison stealthily runs into Hedra's bedroom.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison enters the room, and looks around. She walks to the closet\r\nand starts looking through Hedra's clothes. Suddenly, she notices\r\nthe shoebox on the shelf above the clothes.\r\n\r\nClose up on the shoebox and then on Allison's hand picking it up.\r\n\r\nAllison opens the shoebox. She sits down on the bed, and starts\r\nlooking through the content of the box. She takes several papers\r\nout of the box and looks more closely at them.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the documents Allison is looking through. Several\r\nphotographs, and then a black and white photograph of two twin\r\ngirls with a puppy between them. The twin girls are the one we saw\r\nat the very beginning of the film.\r\n\r\nAllison looks very attentively at the picture. She puts the\r\ndocuments she is holding into the lid of the box and starts\r\nlooking at the rest of the documents.\r\nClose-up on an envelope that reads :\r\n\r\n                            ELLEN BESCH\r\n                        441 OCEANSIDE EAST\r\n                             TAMPA, FLA\r\n\r\nAllison seems surprised by the name on the envelope.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Ellen Besch...\r\n\r\nShe looks through all the other envelopes. On another envelope, a\r\ncomputer-generated label has been glued on the original Ellen\r\nBesch address. It reads :\r\n\r\n                  AUTOMATED MAIL PO BOX NEW YORK\r\n                           PO BOX 72810\r\n                        c/o 845 W. 93RD ST\r\n                         NEW YORK NY 10024\r\n\r\nShe puts the envelopes back into the box, and picks up other\r\ndocuments. They are newspapers clippings.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the clipping Allison is holding. There is a picture of\r\ntwo young twin girls, and above, a title that reads :\r\n\r\n         NINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC\r\n\r\nAnd underneath :\r\n\r\n                       Services were held Friday at\r\n                          Hope Lutheran Church for\r\n                      nine-year old, Judy Besch, of\r\n                          Mapic Drive, who drowned\r\n                        Tuesday at a family picnic.\r\n                      Circumstances surrounding her\r\n                            death remain unclear.\r\n                      A eulogy was delivered by Dr.\r\n                   William Starr, the family's doctor\r\n                         for many years. Among the\r\n\r\nShe puts the clippings back into the box and picks up another\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the envelope, which reads :\r\n\r\n                               ALLIE JONES\r\n                         768 W. 74TH ST. #1103\r\n                           NEW YORK, NY 10017\r\n\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Sam !\r\n\r\nWe see Allison's hand looking inside the already opened envelope\r\nand taking a key-ring out.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nClose-up on Hedra's hand turning the water faucet off.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is reading the letter which was with the keys.\r\n\r\nClose-up shot on the letter. It was written on a Hotel Atherton\r\nstationery. The close-up is too close for us to be able to read\r\nall the words, but we still can read :\r\n\r\n                              DEAR ALLIE,\r\n\r\n                            I KNOW HOW MUCH I HU\r\n                         AND I KNOW HOW LITTLE MY\r\n                       CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.\r\n                          BUT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE\r\n                     WHAT WE HAD, GIVE ME THE CHANCE\r\n                                TO SAY THEM.\r\n                          YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I\r\n                     TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE\r\n                           HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.\r\n                    I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I\r\n                       DON'T HEAR FROM YOU.\r\n                         I LOVE YOU, ALLIE\r\n                                SAM\r\n                        DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M\r\n\r\nAllison reads the letter very attentively. Suddenly she hears some\r\nnoise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe bathroom door is opening slowly\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back\r\ninto the box. She then puts everything back into the box, closes\r\nthe box and puts it back on the shelf.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts\r\nunlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while,\r\nthrough the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white\r\nshirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Do you want me to fix you something before I go ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I love myself like this.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Have fun.\r\n\r\nAllison opens the door and goes out.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah.\r\n\r\nAllison closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose up on the mirror. We see Hedra still fixing her hair\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I love myself like this.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR NIGHT\r\nAllison rings the doorbell of Graham's apartment. Getting no\r\nanswer she knocks on the door. Getting no answer again, she walks\r\naway from the door.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is going down the stairs. She opens a service door, and,\r\nhidden by this door, watches Hedra waiting for the elevator.\r\nAllison rushes back to the staircase.\r\n\r\nHigh-angle shot of the whole staircase, with Allison running down.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - THE STREET OUTSIDE ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThis is the street outside Allison's building, probably seen from\r\nthe entrance of the building, or very near it.\r\n\r\nHedra, coming from behind the camera, crosses the sidewalk,\r\ntowards the street.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Taxi !\r\n\r\nShe raises her hand to stop a taxi cab.\r\n\r\nAllison, also coming from behind the camera, hides behind the\r\ncorner of a wall to watch Hedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey !\r\n\r\nA yellow cab stops and Hedra climbs in it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cab is gone, Allison rushes from her hiding spot\r\nand runs to the street, with her hand raised.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Taxi !\r\n\r\nYELLOW CAB - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nWe are inside Allison's cab. In front of us, through the\r\nwindshield, we see the back of Hedra's cab driving in the heavy\r\ntraffic of New York.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Don't lose her.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Allison seated in the back of the cab.\r\nAllison bends slightly to speak to the driver.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's very important. She has something of mine.\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK - A QUIET STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nCompared to Allison's neighborhood, this is a very quiet district.\r\nAlmost no one in the streets. No shops.\r\nHedra's cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a\r\nfire escape. Hedra walks out just as Allison's cab stops at the\r\ncorner of the street. Allison walks out of her cab. Both cabs\r\ndrive away, and Allison starts following Hedra from a distance.\r\n\r\nMedium shot of Allison following Hedra.\r\n\r\nHedra reaches her destination, another grim building, and goes\r\ndown a stairway, starting from the street and going down to the\r\nbasement of the building. A strong man with a ponytail and glasses\r\nis guarding the entrance. But he lets Allison go down the steps.\r\nOther people follow Allison.\r\n\r\nBASEMENT NIGHT CLUB - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison goes down the last steps to the basement, which actually\r\nis a sort of night club. We hear some religious-sounding music\r\nwith drum rhythms.\r\n\r\nThe place is quite dark, but flashes of light enable us to see\r\nthat all the customers are very smartly dressed, men wearing\r\nelegant suits and neckties, and women wearing elegant dresses.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be watching some sort of a show.\r\n\r\nA young woman, wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black\r\nleather gloves, notices Allison and comes towards her.\r\n\r\n       THE WOMAN\r\n       Do you want to play ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, thanks.\r\n\r\nAllison walks away, followed by the young woman. She passes near a\r\ncage, inside which we see a middle-aged man. The man gets his hand\r\nthrough the bars of the cage, and strokes Allison's cheek. Allison\r\njumps, rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage.\r\nBehind Allison's back, we see the young woman, who was following\r\nher, coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside.\r\n\r\nFrom where she is, Allison can see what's going on at the bar,\r\nwithout actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the bar itself, and more precisely, on\r\nHedra, seated on a stool, with a man, seated on another stool,\r\nstroking her cheek.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Come on, Jim.\r\n\r\nThe bartender, a bald bare-chested young man, turns toward Hedra.\r\n\r\n       THE BARTENDER\r\n       Allie !\r\n\r\nHearing her name, Allison starts and looks at the bartender\r\n       THE BARTENDER (voice over)\r\n       Hey, Allie ! Regular or diet ?\r\n\r\nHedra turns towards the bartender.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Diet.\r\n\r\nA flash of light enable us to have a better view of Hedra's\r\ncompanion, the man she called \u00abJim\u00bb. He looks a bit like Sam.\r\n\r\n       JIM\r\n       Something's different.\r\n\r\nHedra smiles.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yes.\r\n\r\n       JIM\r\n       Yes.\r\n\r\nAllison is staring at the couple\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend.\r\n\r\nJim laughs.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nWe hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the\r\nprevious sequence.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Jesus, Allie, what is it ?\r\n\r\nGraham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the\r\napartment, but stays near the open front door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me\r\n       what to do.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra opens the front door and enters the apartment.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nShe closes the door and locks it.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm home.\r\n\r\nShe drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves into the living room.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThrough the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the\r\nkitchen to go into the living room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nShe seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very\r\nwell. Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the\r\nkitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But,\r\nbeing a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl\r\ncontaining various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and\r\nbreaks into pieces.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nHedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       God...\r\n\r\nThe bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as\r\nthe one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam\r\nand Allison's conversation.\r\n\r\nHedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear\r\na faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where\r\nthis faint voice comes from.\r\n\r\nFirst, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying,\r\nthen it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham\r\nin his apartment.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a\r\n       shoebox in her room.\r\n\r\nHedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and\r\nshe moves closer to it.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at\r\n       birth. It was in an accident when she was nine.\r\n\r\nHedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to\r\nhave a better understanding of the words.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham and Allison are sitting on a couch. Graham has a glass in\r\nhis hand, and Allison a cup.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do\r\n       something.\r\nGraham gets up from the couch.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Get rid of her.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the\r\nair vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and\r\nGraham.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over from the air vent)\r\n       Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you\r\n       have to get her out of the place.\r\n\r\nWe hear steps. Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly\r\nstands up.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham is pouring something we don't see in a glass.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       You're right. I'll tell her tonight.\r\n\r\nAllison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she\r\n       obviously needs help.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on the front door. The door slowly opens and a hand\r\ncovered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door. We\r\nhear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the\r\n       only one she has. Someone like her parent.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nBack to Graham and Allison.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the\r\n       police, okay ?\r\n\r\nAllison laughs.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       That was very impressive.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       I can be butch when I have to. I got it from my mother.\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe room is very dark and only lit by the street lights through\r\nthe window. A shadow moving in the dark. We hear the conversation\r\ncoming from the living room.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over)\r\n       Look, if you worry about her, I've got a friend who's a\r\n       shrink. Maybe he can help her.\r\n\r\nThe shadow moves away from the dark corner where she was hiding :\r\nit is Hedra, who starts walking cautiously in the room.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Oh God ! Maybe after I talk to her, she just leaves.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over)\r\n       Do you want to sleep here tonight ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Oh, don't tempt me. No, I just needed to talk it out.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison and Graham are both standing in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thanks.\r\n\r\nShe walks to a table to pick up her purse.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSensing that Allison is going to leave, Hedra walks back into a\r\ndark corner to hide herself.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       She's not going to chase me out of my own place.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over)\r\n       When's Sam coming back ?\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham is carrying his cat in his arms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAllison picks up her purse and they start walking towards the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThey walk along the corridor, Graham still with his cat in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       That's good.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yeah.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting\r\n       our hair down... Those old air vents between our apartments\r\n       carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing.\r\n\r\nThey've stopped walking.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh... What do you hear ?\r\n\r\nHe does not answer but he makes a face and then laughs, which is a\r\ngood answer to Allison's question. She puts her head down in her\r\nhand, feeling a bit embarrassed.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Big deal. I am sorry. I should've mentioned it sooner.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm so sorry.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       You're sure you want to go down there ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.\r\n\r\nShe starts walking again towards the front door. Graham follows\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAllison opens the door.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Thank you for the tea. I'll see you tomorrow.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\nAllison goes out and Graham closes the door behind her, and then\r\nlocks it.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHigh angle shot of the staircase. Allison is walking down the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe apartment is all dark. The front door opens and Allison walks\r\nin, and closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy ?\r\nShe puts her keys on the shelf by the door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy ?\r\n\r\nShe walks around the hall, looking in all the rooms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy ?\r\n\r\nWe hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head.\r\n\r\nClose up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly. At that very\r\nmoment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's\r\napartment. But actually, we are in :\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise. We hear\r\nGraham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over)\r\n       This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought.\r\n       No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living-\r\nroom, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street\r\nlights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No,\r\n       I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or\r\n       paranoid, whatever. I don't know...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose-up on the air-vent. We see Allison's hands sticking pieces\r\nof large adhesive tape on the air-vent. We hear the faint voice of\r\nGraham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nLarger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces\r\nof tape on the air-vent.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham is still talking on the phone.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from\r\n       there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better\r\n       than I can. Right, okay.\r\n\r\nWe hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head\r\ntowards the noise.\r\n\r\nQuick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room\r\ndoor. It looks empty and quiet.\r\n\r\nBack to Graham on the phone.\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from\r\n       us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this.\r\n\r\nHe puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head\r\nagain in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets\r\nup. He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Carmen...\r\n\r\nHe gets out of the room into the corridor.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat. He\r\nsuddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him. He turns his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nWe see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front\r\ndoor. Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be\r\nmistaken for Allison.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Allie !\r\n\r\nShe doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Goodnight.\r\n\r\nShe has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that\r\nsomething is queer about the girl's attitude.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Hedy ?\r\nShe turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts\r\nfumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sorry...\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We\r\n       just want to get you some help.\r\n\r\nHedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong.\r\n\r\nGraham is walking slowly towards her.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       Okay, take it easy.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sorry, I didn't do anything.\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM\r\n       No problem.\r\n\r\nHedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both\r\nhands. She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he\r\ndoubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder.\r\nGraham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the\r\nhead, leaving him unconscious on the floor.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and\r\nholding the telephone set with her other hand. We hear a beep.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison\r\n       Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen.\r\n       I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of\r\n       stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I\r\n       really, really would not get into this on the answering\r\n       machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm\r\n       sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe front door opens, and Hedra comes in.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone)\r\n       I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front\r\nhall.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, thank you.\r\n\r\nShe puts the phone down.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy ?\r\n\r\nHedra enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is standing near the window, apparently not knowing\r\nexactly what to do next.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra is sitting naked under the shower. She is playing with a\r\njewel ring and humming softly some musical tune.\r\n\r\nWe hear several knocks on the door. Hedra doesn't react at all.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy ?\r\n\r\nHedra answers without moving her head.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\nApparently, Hedra has not spoken loud enough above the noise of\r\nthe shower, because Allison knocks again on the door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy, are you all right ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I can't hear you.\r\n\r\nShe has spoken with a very soft voice, and apparently Allison\r\nhasn't heard her, because she opens the door, and walks slowly\r\ntowards the shower\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been\r\n       in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some\r\n       tea ? Camomile.\r\n\r\nHedra turns slowly her head towards Allison and smiles.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah... that'd be great.\r\n\r\nShe turns the shower off, and stands up. She picks up a towel.\r\nAllison turns her head, apparently feeling embarrassed to see her\r\nnaked.\r\nClose up on the basin, full of water, and where Hedra's clothes\r\nare soaking. The water is red with what looks like blood.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       I'm not feeling really well.\r\n\r\nHedra, wrapped in a large bath towel, has noticed that Allison has\r\nbeen looking at the blood in the basin.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.\r\n\r\nShe walks slowly across the bathroom. When she passes near the\r\nbasin, she notices that a small part of her clothes are not inside\r\nthe basin, and she moves it back inside.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nStill wrapped into the bath towel, Hedra walks slowly out of the\r\nbathroom, followed by Allison.\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Are you crampy ? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. We\r\n       could talk.\r\n\r\nHedra has reached her room's door, and she turns around.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       About what ?\r\n\r\nHedra walks into her room followed by Allison.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra has not switched the light on in the room. The room is just\r\nlit by the street light coming through the window.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       ...It's just crazy keeping two places like this.\r\n\r\nHedra sits on the bed. She is wearing a night shirt and a large\r\nsweater over the night shirt. (NOTE - This could be considered as\r\na continuity goof. Apparently, Hedra has been able to change from\r\nthe bath towel to the night shirt and sweater in less than a\r\nsecond !)\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement\r\n       so you could make sure you can trust him again.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but\r\n       it is.\r\n\r\nHedra cracks her knuckles.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Huh-huh... It's me, isn't it ? I'll change, Allie. I can\r\n       change.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate.\r\n       It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us\r\n       to start our lives together.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And\r\n       when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause...\r\n       I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she has a very menacing face. Allison, still standing\r\nup, looks down at her with a very hard stare. Hedra, seeing that\r\nstare, calms down and laughs.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings, but Allison, who is still looking down at Hedra\r\nwith her very hard stare, doesn't move. Hedra turns her head in\r\nthe direction of the phone.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nHedra now has a very sweet look on her face. She gets up and out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra picks up the phone from the little table in the hall.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hello ?\r\n\r\nAllison enters the room from Hedra's bedroom.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Is it Sam ?\r\n\r\nWe hear a male voice over the phone. We quickly understand it's\r\nHedra's father.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)\r\n       Ellen, is that you ? Talk to me, or your mother. Honey, we\r\n       miss you. We want you to come home.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (with a deep menacing voice)\r\n       Don't call here again.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)\r\n       Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't\r\n       come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come.\r\n\r\nHedra puts the telephone down. She doesn't move for a couple of\r\nseconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than\r\nshe actually is. She has a little nervous laugh.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Obscene phone call. New York !\r\n\r\nThe phone rings again. Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on\r\nthe table. Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to\r\ncut off the communication.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Find someone else, jerk !\r\n\r\nAllison walks to the telephone table.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in\r\n       tonight.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's\r\n       busy.\r\n\r\nHedra hugs Allison.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sorry, Allie.\r\n\r\nShe moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I\r\n       just... I don't want you making a mistake.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in\r\n       touch.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Sure.\r\n\r\nAllison walks away to her room.\r\n\r\nHedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without\r\nputting the receiver back on its hook. We hear several short beeps\r\ncoming from the telephone. With one nervous movement, Hedra tears\r\nthe cord off the wall socket. Then she walks slowly into her room.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nA little later. Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a\r\nnotebook. She is humming a song. Her other hand is resting on the\r\ntelephone set on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings. Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (whispering)\r\n       Hello ?\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over on the phone)\r\n       Allie ?\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, it's Hedy.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie. He\r\nis talking on the telephone.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)\r\n       Where are you ? Where are you ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)\r\n       Yeah...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nHedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ?\r\n\r\n       SAM (voice over on the phone)\r\n       No, tell her to surprise me.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over on the phone)\r\n       Okay, I'll tell her.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Goodnight, honey.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.\r\n\r\nShe slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it.\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThe heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman\r\nwalking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel. No\r\none else is in the streets at this time of the night. The woman is\r\nwearing a grey raincoat.\r\n\r\nThe woman enters the hotel.\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nSam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and\r\napparently naked underneath.\r\n\r\nThe door opens slowly. The woman in the grey raincoat enters the\r\nroom. We have already guessed she is Hedra.\r\n\r\nShe closes the door and puts the key on the night table.\r\n\r\nShe remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam,\r\nthen she slowly starts to take the raincoat off. She is completely\r\nnaked under the raincoat.\r\n\r\nShe slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam. Sam moans in\r\nhis sleep. He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him\r\non the chest.\r\n\r\n       SAM (sleepy voice)\r\n       Allie, Allie... what are you doing ?\r\nHedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him. When she gets\r\nbetween his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she\r\nis performing oral sex on him.\r\n\r\nSam moans with pleasure.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Oh... Oh... Jesus !... Oh... Gee...\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Sam realizes that something may be wrong. He gives an\r\nanxious look at Hedra.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nHedra raises her head from Sam's private parts.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, not Allie.\r\n\r\nShe resumes what she was doing. Sam would like to push her away,\r\nbut he is so close to his climax that he can't do it.\r\n\r\nHe has his orgasm, with Hedra not moving away from between his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nShe only raises her head when she is sure it is over. She gives\r\nhim a light kiss on the pubis and smiles.\r\n\r\nThen she moves up in the bed, her head finally resting near Sam's\r\none. Sam is breathing very hard. Hedra strokes him on the chest,\r\nand kisses his cheek.\r\n\r\nThen she gets up and off the bed, and puts her raincoat back on.\r\n\r\nShe picks up a half-full glass on a table and drinks from it, what\r\nlooks like beer. Then she eats something from a plate on the same\r\ntable.\r\nSam breathes normally again and moves slowly on the bed. He lies\r\non his side, facing away from Hedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey !\r\n\r\nWith the glass still in her hand, she walks to the bed\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey, sleepy guy.\r\n\r\nShe puts the glass on the night table, and kneels on the bed. She\r\nstart stroking Sam's shoulder.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I knew it.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Knew what ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be\r\n       faithful. And now she'll know.\r\n\r\nWhile talking, she keeps on stroking his face. Sam doesn't react\r\nto her caress.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       She'll know what ?\r\n\r\nHe switches on the light on the night-table. He then turn around\r\nto face her.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       That you came up here and pretended to be her ? My God,\r\n       what is this hair ? What is this supposed to mean ? You're\r\n       in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume! For Christ-\r\n       sake !\r\n\r\nHe jumps out of the bed, and starts putting his clothes on. Hedra\r\nremains seated on the bed, drinking her glass.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care.\r\n       Well, I think she should know that.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship.\r\n\r\nShe puts her glass on the night table, and gathers her shoes to\r\nput them back on her feet.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       She can't... she can't stand you, for Christ-sake !\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       That's not true.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Oh, bullshit !\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Huh-huh.\r\n\r\nShe shakes her head \u00abno\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       You're too needy. You're always cleaning. You're constantly\r\n       in her face.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost\r\n       raped her ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or\r\n       screwing someone.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       She never said a word to me about that.\r\n\r\nAfter his pants, Sam has put his shirt back on.\r\n\r\nHedra gets up from the bed where she was still sitting.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       That's right, she told me.\r\n\r\nShe sits back on the bed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We\r\n       lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're\r\n       best friends.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       You're nuts, you know that ? Yes... I think you're out of\r\n       your skull, that's right.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah, well, sticks and stones...\r\n\r\nHe comes near the bed and bends down to pick up something. Hedra\r\nrushes on him.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Sam !\r\n\r\nHe pushes her away from him.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Don't touch me !\r\nShe sits back on the bed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I\r\n       won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and\r\n       call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or\r\n       something. And I won't say a word, okay ?\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart,\r\n       because I'm going to tell her myself.\r\n\r\nHe walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone. She throws\r\none of her shoes towards him. The shoe hits the wall just above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (yelling)\r\n       No !\r\n\r\nHe rushes towards her, ready to hit her.\r\n\r\n       SAM\r\n       Fucking bitch !\r\n\r\nBut, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face\r\nwith her other shoe. The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left\r\neye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his\r\nbrain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his\r\nback on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious.\r\n\r\nWith her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (softly)\r\n       Hey !... Hey !\r\n\r\nHOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's feet walking on the rug. She's wearing both of\r\nher stiletto heels shoes.\r\n\r\nHedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk.\r\nThe same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam\r\nand Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone.\r\nHe is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what\r\nhe's saying.\r\n\r\nBut, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on\r\nthe receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice :\r\n\r\n\r\n       HOTEL CLERK\r\n       Goodnight, Miss Jones.\r\n\r\nWithout turning her head, Hedra waves her hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Goodnight.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nClose up on the clock on the night table : it says 06:22.\r\n\r\nAllison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison comes out of her bedroom, wearing a long sleeveless pink\r\nnight shirt. She seems to be naked underneath.\r\n\r\nShe walks around the room, looking in every room which door is\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy ?... Hedy ?\r\n\r\nShe eventually finds her in the living room, vigorously cleaning\r\nthe mantlepiece. Hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red\r\nrubber gloves. Allison remains at the door of the room.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy ?\r\nHedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today.\r\n\r\nHedra looks around the room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh, there, I think that's it.\r\n\r\nShe goes out of the room into the hall.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the\r\n       cage downstairs.\r\n\r\nShe resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall, starting with the\r\nsmall shelf by the front door.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean...\r\n       You know... I mean...\r\n\r\nAllison has come near Hedra.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work\r\n       out.\r\n\r\nHedra has stacked \u00abher stuff\u00bb near the front door. She picks them\r\nup : a red suitcase, a cardboard box and a large paper bag. She\r\nhas taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here.\r\nAllison walks to the door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'll help.\r\n\r\nShe opens the door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       We can have breakfast when you get back.\r\n\r\nHedra walks out of the apartment. Allison closes the door, but\r\nremains behind it, lost in her thoughts.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra is rapidly walking along a corridor, carrying \u00abher stuff\u00bb.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose up on the open red suitcase. Inside, all the clothes that\r\nmakes Hedra look like Allison.\r\nHedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the\r\nopen incinerator. Then she sprays some lighter fluid over the\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's hands striking a match on the side of a\r\nmatchbox. She throws the match into the incinerator, and long\r\nflames immediately start on the clothes.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is fixing breakfast. She has cut some fruits into small\r\npieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender. We hear some\r\nmusic from the TV in the background.\r\n\r\nAllison walks to a cupboard on the wall to pick up a spices jar.\r\n\r\nThe door leading to the living room is open, and the TV is on.\r\nAllison gives a quick look at the TV, on her way back from the\r\ncupboard to the kitchen working bench.\r\n\r\nAllison puts a bit of spices from the jar into the blender, closes\r\nthe lid and starts the blender.\r\n\r\n       MALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       And now, Morning News-break...\r\n\r\nThe rest of the words of the TV reporter are lost, covered by the\r\nnoise from the blender. But the voice of a female reporter, being\r\nslightly louder, can be heard over the blender noise\r\n\r\n       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       Police found the body of a man brutally murdered early this\r\n       morning.\r\n\r\nAllison shuts the blender off, and walks to the open door to watch\r\nTV.\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose up on the TV screen, showing the reporter, standing, with\r\nher microphone in hand, near the entrance of the Atherton Hotel.\r\n\r\n       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       Identification of the victim, a white male of around 30\r\n       years of age is pending notification of next of kin.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot of Allison, standing in the doorway and peeling\r\na banana.\r\n\r\n       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       A witness I spoke to just right here said...\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the TV.\r\n\r\n       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       ...he heard the sound of a struggle emanating from room\r\n       612...\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Allison.\r\n       FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set)\r\n       ...around four o'clock this morning.\r\n\r\nAllison suddenly realizes that the room number is Sam's one. She\r\nrushes to the telephone set on the wall near the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison dials very nervously a number on the phone.\r\n\r\n       HOTEL CLERK (voice over from the phone)\r\n       Atherton Hotel.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Sam Rawson's room, please, room 6-12..\r\n\r\n       HOTEL CLERK (voice over on the phone)\r\n       I'm sorry, there's been an accident. I think you should\r\n       speak to the police.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't even wait for the end of the sentence, and drops the\r\nphone, letting the receiver hang on its cord. She rushes out of\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra is leaving the room, carrying \u00abher stuff\u00bb. Behind her, the\r\nincinerator door is wide open, and we see a bright fire inside.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAcross the corridor from the incinerator room, Hedra reaches\r\nAllison's private \u00abcage\u00bb. She drops \u00abher stuff\u00bb and opens the\r\npadlock.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nAllison is bending over the toilet bowl and vomiting.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nIn the \u00abcage\u00bb, Hedra takes a boot out of the cardboard box. Then\r\nshe takes a sock out of the boot, and delicately, takes a black\r\nhand gun out of the boot. She puts the gun in the paper back,\r\nabove some clothes.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is still vomiting in the toilet bowl. She slowly raises\r\nher head from the toilet bowl, trying to catch her breath.\r\n\r\nShe sees Hedra's pair of stiletto heel shoes. Underneath one of\r\nthe heels, there are some traces of blood on the tile floor of the\r\nbathroom.\r\n\r\nKneeling on the floor, Allison takes the shoe to look at it more\r\nclosely. Then she screams and throws it away, knocking the other\r\nshoe down on the floor.\r\nShe is still kneeling on the floor, crying, when the door opens\r\nand Hedra enters the room. Allison raises her head to look at\r\nHedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nHedra sees the stiletto heel shoe behind the toilet bowl, where it\r\nhas been knocked away.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What are you doing down there ?\r\n\r\nAllison remains kneeling on the floor, just supporting herself on\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh... I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing.\r\n       I hope I'm not pregnant.\r\n\r\nHedra walks towards Allison to help her stand up.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Let me help you.\r\n\r\nAllison stands up.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, that's all right, I'm fine.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'll get some water.\r\n\r\nHedra walks to the basin, but wraps her hand in the bottom of her\r\ndress before touching the water tap.\r\n\r\nAllison walks out of the room.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Wait !\r\n\r\nAllison stops at the door, and turns around toward Hedra.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the mirror above the basin, showing Hedra and Allison\r\nstanding next to each other.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Drink some.\r\n\r\nAllison takes the tooth glass and drinks. Hedra strokes her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay ?\r\n\r\nAllison puts the glass down and shakes her head \u00abYes\u00bb. Hedra\r\nstrokes the back of her head.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Feeling better ?\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I thought you said breakfast ?\r\n\r\nAllison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out.\r\n\r\nHedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Dressed like that?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He\r\n       called while you were out.\r\n\r\nHedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face.\r\nShe can see the tears on Allison's face.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear\r\n       more than that.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Maybe you're right.\r\n\r\nShe walks away to her room. Hedra puts her hand on her face.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison enters her room coming from the hall.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over from the hall)\r\n       Leave the door open so we can talk.\r\n\r\nAllison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on.\r\n\r\nHedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag\r\nwhere she has put the gun.\r\n\r\nAllison takes her night shirt off. She is now naked from the waist\r\nup. But she grabs a sweater and puts it on.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You know why I think you're sick ?\r\n\r\nWhile talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag,\r\ntakes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You're upset about Sam.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You know Sam's dead, don't you ?\r\n\r\nAllison turns around to face Hedra.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah, we don't have much time.\r\n\r\nShe picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers. She puts the\r\nbag on the floor and opens the top drawer.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (crying)\r\n       You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ?\r\n\r\nHedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (crying)\r\n       You couldn't have him !\r\n\r\nShe falls down, sitting on the floor and crying.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Why ?... Why ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit\r\n       out of me because I wanted to tell you.\r\n\r\nShe slams the drawer shut, and opens another one.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it.\r\n\r\nShe claps her hands.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay, come on. The police will be here soon.\r\n\r\nAllison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I\r\n       know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy.\r\n\r\nHedra laughs.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I know. I was you.\r\n\r\nShe points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself\r\nin the mirror.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Who is this Hedy anyway ?\r\n\r\nShe turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even\r\n       a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy.\r\n       You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you.\r\n       We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and\r\n       they'll explain it to the police, or something.\r\n\r\nHedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top\r\nof the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No.\r\n\r\nShe bends down and takes the gun out of the paper bag.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Why are you making me do this ?\r\n\r\nShe snaps a cartridge into the chamber of the gun.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble\r\n       without me. But I'm not going to leave you.\r\n\r\nShe walks to Allison and kneels on the floor besides her, pointing\r\nthe gun to her head\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go.\r\n       Up ! Up ! Up !\r\n\r\nShe slaps her face.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra leads Allison along the hall. She is carrying her paper bag\r\nin one hand and the gun in the other hand. She still has her\r\ngloves on. Allison is carrying a small plastic case.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Go ! Go-go-go !\r\n\r\nThey reach the elevator and Allison is ready to press the call\r\nbutton, but Hedra moves her away towards the staircase.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already\r\n       involved.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR DAY\r\nThey climb the stairs. Hedra is pushing Allison with her gun.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThey reach Graham's front door. Allison rings the bell, waits a\r\ncouple of seconds and turns around.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Nobody's home.\r\n\r\nHedra takes some keys out of her bag and gives them to Allison\r\nwith the gloved hand that is still holding the gun.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go !\r\n\r\nAllison takes the keys and unlocks the door.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       He must be sleeping. We were up late last night.\r\n\r\nHedra seems very nervous. While Allison is unlocking the door, she\r\nkeeps looking around her and pressing Allison's back with her gun.\r\n\r\nAllison opens the door, and enters the apartment, followed by\r\nHedra.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Graham ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       He can't hear you.\r\n\r\nHedra closes the door behind them.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\r\nLow angle shot of the building, taken from street level.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Wait till you see me.\r\n\r\nHedra comes out of the bathroom, with a dark towel on her head.\r\n\r\nThe cat crosses the corridor and enters the bathroom.\r\n\r\nHedra puts her towel down : her hair, instead of being red like\r\nAllison's, is now dark brown.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking\r\n       like you any more, can I ?\r\n\r\nShe smiles.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nHedra enters the living-room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.\r\n\r\nShe walks in front of the window, and makes a couple of dance\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Ta-dah !\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Allison, tied up in an armchair with duct\r\ntape. Each one of Allison's arms is tied on each armrest of the\r\narmchair. Her legs are tied on the legs of the armchair, and her\r\nchest is tied on the back of the armchair. There is also a piece\r\nof tape across her face to keep her mouth shut.\r\n\r\nHedra laughs and turns the TV set on. The screen shows a\r\ndocumentary about African fauna. Hedra turns the volume slightly\r\nup.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       How's that ? Good ?\r\n\r\nShe puts the remote control on the armrest of the armchair, within\r\neasy reach of Allison's right hand. Allison doesn't move at all.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay\r\n       cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate\r\n       to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All\r\n       right.\r\n\r\nShe walks away from the armchair, takes the towel off her neck and\r\ndown on the back of a chair. She takes her purse.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too.\r\n       Okay ? Be good. Bye.\r\n\r\nShe gets out of the room.\r\n\r\nAllison moves for the first time : she turns her head around, then\r\nlooks back at the TV screen.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot. On the TV screen, close up of a lion yawning.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot. Allison looks at the remote control on the\r\narmrest.\r\n\r\nClose up on the remote control. Almost at the top of the remote\r\ncontrol, we see the two volume control buttons : up and down. And\r\nunder those buttons, we see the two channel control buttons.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's face looking at the remote control.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's right hand moving the remote control on the\r\narmrest, to get the volume control buttons within reach of her\r\nforefinger.

And the volume of the music goes up too.\r\n\r\nAllison looks at the remote control again.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's forefinger pressing one of the channel\r\ncontrol buttons.\r\n\r\nOn the screen, we see a different channel : a comic movie. A\r\ncouple is having dinner in a restaurant and the waiter pours the\r\nwater bucket on the man.\r\n\r\nAnother channel. A woman is sleeping. A telephone rings.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on Allison pressing the channel control\r\nbuttons. We hear a male voice for a couple of second, then Allison\r\nchanges the channel again.\r\n\r\nThe TV screen seen from behind Allison's hand dialing on the\r\nremote control. There is a cartoon on the screen. Then another\r\nchannel showing the concert of a rock music band.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's face looking at the screen and then at the\r\nremote control in her hand.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the TV set. The volume bar graph is going up\r\nagain until it reaches the end of the graph. The volume of the\r\nsound of the rock music is very high.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nWe hear the rock music very loudly in the empty hall.\r\n\r\nThe front door of apartment 1206 opens slowly. A man with glasses\r\non his nose peeks into the hall. He seems very annoyed by the\r\nnoise.\r\nBANK OFFICE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nClose up on the hand of Hedra writing \u00abEllen Besch\u00bb on the back of\r\na cheque on the cashier's counter. In front of her, we see the\r\nhands of the cashier girl on the other side of the glass\r\npartition.\r\n\r\n       CASHIER GIRL (voice over)\r\n       What's the part this time ?\r\n\r\nLarger view of the bank office hall.

Now we are on the cashier's side of the partition,\r\nand we see Hedra's face through the glass.\r\n\r\n       CASHIER GIRL\r\n       You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person\r\n       twice.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot. We are now on Hedra's side of the partition,\r\nand we see the cashier girl through the glass : she is a blonde\r\ngirl about the same age as Hedra. She puts her finger on her own\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n       CASHIER GIRL\r\n       I like it. I just thought the other was more you.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot. Cashier's side.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot. Hedra's side. The cashier girl smiles.\r\n\r\n       CASHIER GIRL\r\n       Really ? I'm flattered. Thanks.\r\n\r\nA male bank clerk, sitting at a desk behind the cashier girl,\r\nstands up and walks to the partition glass.\r\n\r\n       BANK CLERK\r\n       Miss Besch ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yes ?\r\n\r\n       BANK CLERK\r\n       A man's been calling here.

But the duct tape is strong enough\r\nand her jerky movements don't bring any result.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR DAY\r\nOutside Graham's apartment. We hear the loud rock music very\r\nclearly. The building manager is standing by the door, with the\r\nneighbor from apartment 1206 behind him. The neighbor has his\r\nglasses hanging around his neck on a string.\r\n\r\nThe building manager rings the bell. Then he bangs on the door\r\nwith his fist.\r\n\r\n       BUILDING MANAGER\r\n       Hey !\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison turns her head towards the front door and try to speak\r\nthrough the tape stuck on her mouth.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Mmmm !\r\n\r\nShe starts moving again to free herself from the armchair, but she\r\ndoesn't succeed.\r\n\r\nThe bell rings again. Allison turns her heard towards the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nA BUSY STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra is walking very fast on the sidewalk.

She turns the corner of the hall and suddenly sees\r\nthe manager and the neighbor near Graham's door. She runs towards\r\nthem and yells.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh !\r\n\r\nThe apartment door is wide open, but, when they see Hedra, the two\r\nmen don't enter the apartment. The neighbor goes back into his own\r\napartment, but the manager remains just outside the apartment.\r\n\r\n       BUILDING MANAGER\r\n       You live here ?\r\n\r\nHedra closes the door to talk to the manager, but she doesn't lock\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, no, I'm just watching the place for the week-end like\r\n       that. It's on a timer. Huh... Huh... I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n       BUILDING MANAGER\r\n       I have to register a complaint.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Please, I'll turn it off.

She drops her purse on a\r\nchair and walks to the TV set. She switches it off. Then she walks\r\nslowly towards Allison, with a quite menacing face.\r\n\r\nShe gives Allison a very hard slap in the face. She kneels down in\r\nfront of her, and shakes her shoulders a couple of times. Then she\r\nstops but remains kneeling on the floor, while she's talking to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       How could you do that ? Everything I've done, I've done for\r\n       you. Don't you understand that ? People you hated, I hated.\r\n\r\nShe stands up.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       People like you don't care.\r\n\r\nShe knocks a large metal vase down on the floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents,\r\n       too. Told them all my secrets.\r\n\r\nShe comes behind Allison and pulls her hair to tilt her head back.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You want to put me away, huh ?\r\n\r\nShe releases Allison's hair.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I\r\n       can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't...\r\n\r\nShe walks out of the room. She is crying.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh God !... Oh God !... Ohhh !\r\n\r\nWe hear her crying in the next room. Allison turns her head\r\nslightly towards her.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's face. We hear Hedra screaming and breaking\r\nthings. Allison seems terrified.\r\n\r\nHedra comes back into the room. She has a big knife with a\r\nserrated blade in her hand.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's face. She seems more and more terrified. She\r\nstarts moaning under her tape gag.\r\n\r\nHedra is now just behind Allison. She puts the tip of the blade on\r\nAllison's throat, then the full length of the blade.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       What ?... What ?\r\n\r\nShe tears the tape off Allison's mouth.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Please...\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No.\r\n\r\nHedra's face is now very close to Allison's one. Allison raises\r\nher head and kisses Hedra on the mouth.\r\n\r\nClose up on the serrated blade of the knife on Allison's throat.\r\nThe blade is ready to tear the skin, but doesn't move further.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Allison moves her mouth away from Hedra's one.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (whispering)\r\n       Don't make me leave you, Ellen.\r\n\r\nHedra slowly raises up. She has a strange look on her face. She\r\nseems not to understand the situation anymore.\r\n\r\nClose-up on Allison's head and throat. We can see the slightly\r\nbloody marks left by the serrated blade. Allison looks at Hedra\r\nmoving away from her with an anxious face.\r\n\r\nHedra kneels down in front of Allison. She bends down to rest her\r\nface on Allison's lap, and starts crying. Allison moves her hand\r\nas far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay.\r\n\r\nClose-up on a wallet on the floor, close to Allison's foot.\r\nAllison is trying to reach it with her foot, but she can't because\r\nof her leg still being taped on the armchair.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       We've got to get out of here now.\r\n\r\nShe eventually succeeds in kicking the wallet away from the\r\narmchair. And she keeps on stroking Hedra's hair, still crying on\r\nher lap.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK - EXTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nLarge overview of the city. There is still daylight, but we can\r\ntell, by the color of the sky, that we are getting closer to the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nIn the forefront, Mitchell's assistant, Barbara, is typing on the\r\nkeyboard of a computer. Behind her, we see rows of dresses on\r\nhangers.\r\nSuddenly, the woman stares at the screen. We hear strange clicking\r\nand beeping noises coming from the computer.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA\r\n       Jesus...\r\n\r\nShe stands up, with horror in her face, and yells.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA\r\n       Mitch !\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nThe room is much smaller, and quite dark. A blonde woman is\r\nsitting on an armchair in front of a desk. Mitchell is standing\r\nbehind her. Mitchell is slightly rocking the armchair and the\r\nblonde woman's eyes are closed.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       What ?\r\nHe doesn't stop rocking the armchair.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA (voice over from the main hall)\r\n       Get in here.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       What ?\r\n\r\nHe reluctantly leaves the armchair and walks out of the room.\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nMitchell crosses the hall\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       What is it ? What?\r\n\r\nThe computer is still making strange beeping noises. On the\r\nscreen, pictures of dresses appear and then disappear immediately.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA\r\n       Look.\r\n\r\nClose up on the screen. A data chart titled \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb has\r\nappeared. The extreme left column is labelled \u00abExpenses\u00bb, and\r\nunderneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone -\r\nPayroll - Liabilities... and son on). The other columns on the\r\nright are labelled \u00abJan\u00bb to \u00abApr\u00bb, and underneath lists of numbers\r\ncorresponding to the various monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nBut, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the\r\ncolumns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting\r\nwith January.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA\r\n       It's erasing.\r\n\r\nThen, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on\r\nthe screen with \u00abLOST!\u00bb written in red letters in it.\r\n\r\nAnother data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May\r\nto August. And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start\r\nto erase themselves.\r\n\r\nMitchell looks severely at Barbara. She raises her hands.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA\r\n       I didn't do anything.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Shit !\r\n\r\nHe runs away toward his office.\r\n\r\nThe blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office.\r\nMitchell brutally pushes her away.\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING\r\nMitchell types something on the keyboard of his computer. We hear\r\nthe computer beeping.\r\n\r\nClose-up on the computer screen. A data chart titled \u00abProduction\r\nline\u00bb, and underneath \u00abFontana Fashions Production Line\u00bb.\r\nUnderneath, four columns of numbers labelled \u00abOrder\u00bb, \u00abSam\u00bb,\r\n\u00abScheduled\u00bb and \u00abCompleted\u00bb. All the numbers in these columns are\r\nerasing themselves. And then appears the window with \u00abLOST!\u00bb in\r\nred letters.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       On mine, too !\r\n\r\nThen another rectangular window appears on the screen. On the left\r\nof the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking\r\nout of it. On the rest of the window, the following text :\r\n\r\n       The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between\r\n       Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is now past due.\r\n       Please contact Allison Jones at 212-555-9814 within 24\r\n       Hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\nMitchell bends down to have a better look at the screen.\r\n\r\nClose up on the screen, while Mitchell reads out loud :\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between\r\n       Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is past due. Please\r\n       contact Allison Jones...\r\n\r\nMedium shot of Mitchell reading what's written on the screen.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       ...in 24 hours of the rest of your data will be\r\n       irretrievably lost. This payment policing program is\r\n       installed on all of Allison Jones software.\"\r\nMitchell jumps up.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Bitch !\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - WORKING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nAllison is seated behind Graham's desk. She unplugs the cord from\r\nthe telephone set and plugs it in the back of a small portable\r\ncomputer.\r\n\r\nShot on floor level. We see the bottom of the desk chair and\r\nAllison's legs, around which there is still some duct tape. Hedra\r\nis kneeling on the floor near the desk. She has a telephone cord\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Should I just plug this in the phone jack ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Huh-huh.\r\nHedra gets up and looks at what Allison is doing with the\r\ncomputer.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Great.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Can you make reservations on this ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Hm-m. And you can pay by credit card.\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's face who looks intensely at Allison, not\r\nbelieving completely that Allison is not trying to fool her.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       L.A., right ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Yeah.\r\n\r\nShe walks away.\r\n\r\nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison Jones' business card. Above her name, a logo\r\nthat reads \u00abConcept Software\u00bb. Under Allison's name, the title\r\n\u00abSoftware Designer\u00bb, and underneath \u00ab768 West 74th Street, Suite\r\n1103, New York\u00bb, and underneath \u00ab(212) 555-9814\u00bb. On the top of\r\nthe card, written with a pencil \u00ab555-8796 KNOX\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       BARBARA (voice over)\r\n       No answer at the first number.\r\n\r\nMitchell's forefinger points at the penciled number on the card.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n       What about this number ?\r\n\r\nMitchell is standing near Barbara's desk. She has the telephone\r\nreceiver to her ear, trying to reach someone to help them.\r\nMitchell brings the next desk telephone to him by pulling it by\r\nits cord. He start dialing on the telephone.\r\n\r\nWe hear the \u00abengaged\u00bb tone.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Busy.\r\n\r\nHe throws the receiver on the desk. He starts walking away, then\r\nturns to Barbara.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       You turn them off.\r\n       (yelling)\r\n       Turn them all off !\r\n\r\nBarbara remains calm, with the telephone receiver still at her\r\near.\r\nMitchell runs out of the room, and Barbara puts the telephone\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - WORKING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nClose up on the computer screen. The window is titled\r\n\u00abCompuserve\u00bb. Underneath it reads \u00abFlight Reservation\u00bb. And\r\nunderneath \u00abBrowse Flights by Fares\u00bb. Underneath : \u00abDeparture\r\nCity:\u00bb. Next to it a box, where we see the letters \u00abJFK\u00bb being\r\ntyped. Underneath \u00abDestination City:\u00bb. Next to it, another box,\r\nwhere we see the letters \u00abLAX\u00bb being typed. Another window\r\nappears, titled \u00abFlight Information\u00bb, and giving all the details\r\nof the different flights between New-York and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAllison is sitting at the desk typing on the computer, and Hedra\r\nis standing next to her.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Things are going to be different in L.A, Allie. You'll see.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       First class ?\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Is it worth it ?\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Well, we can use one of Graham's cards. I think I saw his\r\n       wallet in the living room.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh... Me too. Okay, I'll go and see.\r\n\r\nShe gets out of the room.\r\n\r\nClose up on the computer screen. It switches from \u00abFlight\r\nInformation\u00bb to \u00abMain Menu\u00bb, and then to \u00abChat-Mail Menu\u00bb.\r\nClose up on Allison's face focused on her typing on the computer.\r\n\r\nClose up on the computer screen. It reads \u00abCB Simulator\u00bb, and\r\nunderneath \u00abChat Mode Initiated\u00bb, and underneath \u00abUser: Don193\u00bb.\r\nUnderneath, we see the following words being typed :\r\n\r\n       PLEASE HELP ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over from the living room)\r\n       I can't find it.\r\n\r\nAllison is typing very fast. She knows she doesn't have much time.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nClose up on the computer screen. The following words have been\r\nadded :\r\n\r\n       I'M AT 768 W.74TH STREET, APT.\r\nBack on Allison sitting at the desk and typing. Slowly and\r\nsilently, Hedra enters the room.\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's angry face. She bends down\r\n\r\nAllison at the desk seen from behind. Suddenly we hear the noise\r\nof a plug being pulled off from its socket. The computer screen\r\nbecomes all black and Allison turns quickly around. Hedra is\r\npointing her gun at her.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No ! No ! No ! No !\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN LOBBY - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nClose up shot on the window above the elevator door. We see the\r\nelevator coming down. The camera follows the elevator down to\r\nfloor level. Mitchell is waiting in front of the elevator door.\r\n\r\nThe elevator outer door opens. Hedra is inside. She keeps the\r\ninner door shut.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Going down.\r\n\r\nThe outer door closes in front of a bewildered Mitchell.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR EVENING\r\n\r\nHedra opens the door of Allison's private \u00abcage\u00bb, and enters the\r\ncage. She tries to open a suitcase, but doesn't succeed. She slaps\r\nnervously the suitcase. She then finds another suitcase, which is\r\nopen. She tries to fit herself inside the suitcase, and more or\r\nless succeeds. She seems very nervous. She gets out of the\r\nsuitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR EVENING\r\nClose up on the numbers above the door. They go from \u00ab9\u00bb to \u00ab10\u00bb,\r\nand then to \u00ab11\u00bb.\r\n\r\nHedra is watching the numbers. The elevator stops.\r\n\r\nThe outer door opens. Mitchell is there, waiting for the elevator.\r\nHe opens the inner door and comes in the cabin. The outer door\r\ncloses automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again\r\n\r\nHe looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted.\r\nThen he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather\r\nunwelcoming face.\r\n\r\nThe elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nThrough the windows, we can see that night has come.\r\n\r\nMitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her\r\nsuitcase behind her.\r\nHedra goes directly to Graham's apartment. Mitchell first goes in\r\nthe opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at\r\n       home ?\r\n\r\nHedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the\r\nkeyhole. Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No, he's on a cruise.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you\r\n       know her ?\r\n\r\nHedra suddenly stops unlocking the door.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Who are you ?\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Mitchell Myerson.\r\n\r\nHedra turns around to face Mitchell.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       She did a job for me.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I\r\n       did contact her here once.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So...\r\n       You'll excuse me.\r\n\r\nShe bends down to pick up the suitcase.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       Oh, sorry.\r\n\r\nMitchell bends down to help her. He picks up the suitcase and\r\nlooks at it.\r\n\r\n       MITCHELL\r\n       This is hers. You do know her.\r\n\r\nWe hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment.\r\n\r\nHedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but\r\nMitchell catches her and throws her aside. More muffled screams\r\ncoming from the apartment. Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and\r\ncloses the door shut behind him. Hedra rushes to the door, but too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nMitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down.\r\n\r\nAllison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape,\r\nlooking like a human salami. She is gagged by another piece of\r\ntape. When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming\r\nthrough her gag.\r\n\r\n        MITCHELL (voice over)\r\n        What the fuck is going on here ?\r\n\r\nHe kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth.\r\n\r\n        ALLISON\r\n        Be careful, she's crazy.\r\n\r\nHedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell.\r\n\r\n        HEDRA\r\n        Get off of her.\r\n\r\nMitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around.\r\n\r\n        MITCHELL\r\n        What ?\r\n\r\nHedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in\r\nfront of her.\r\n\r\n        HEDRA\r\n        You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off\r\n        her !\r\n\r\n        MITCHELL\r\n        Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay.\r\nHe gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders\r\nlevel. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the\r\nroom. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight.\r\nShe remains motionless on the floor.\r\n\r\nAllison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position\r\non the carpet, doesn't see everything.\r\n\r\nMitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie\r\nAllison.\r\n\r\n        ALLISON\r\n        Where is she ?\r\n\r\n        MITCHELL\r\n        Don't worry about her, I took care of her.\r\n\r\nHedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the\r\nhead with a statuette. He falls down on the floor. Hedra rushes to\r\nhim and picks up the gun from his belt. She takes a cushion from\r\nthe back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and\r\npresses the barrel of the gun on the cushion. Allison screams.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nGraham is lying in the empty bathtub, with his cat sleeping on his\r\nright shoulder. There are a few traces of blood on the side of the\r\nbathtub.\r\n\r\nWe hear the muffled sound of a gun shot. Then a scream from\r\nAllison and another gunshot.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves closer to Graham's face. He has a large bloody\r\nbump on his forehead.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight move of his head, then a slight blink of his\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's hands taking some pills out of a medicine\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...\r\n\r\nThe camera moves up to Hedra's face.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I\r\n       don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any\r\n       more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a\r\n       reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there\r\n       isn't one.\r\n\r\nHedra turns her head towards Allison sitting at the desk in front\r\nof the computer. The camera moves away to a larger shot, and we\r\nsee that the gun is stuck in the hollow of Hedra's left elbow.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You don't want to say anything special to anyone ?\r\n\r\nAllison shakes her head \u00abno\u00bb.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Okay, \u00abAllison Jones\u00bb, go on.\r\n\r\nClose up on the computer screen. We see the words Hedra just\r\ndictated : \u00abI don't want to try to be loved...\u00bb and so on up to\r\n\u00ab...there isn't one.\u00bb The words \u00abAllison Jones\u00bb are being typed.\r\n\r\nBack to Hedra pointing her gun to Allison. She takes Allison's\r\nhand and presses it on the screen of the computer.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Now they'll know it was you.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was\r\n       never that scared. Well... not like that.\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being\r\n       alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care.\r\n\r\nShe brings a glass of water to Allison, who takes it.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Did you know that identical twins are never really\r\n       identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one\r\n       who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left\r\n       me. Just like you.\r\n\r\nShe puts the barrel of the gun on Allison's temple, and she opens\r\nher left hand in front of Allison's face.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Okay.\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's hand full of blue pills. She pours them into\r\nAllison's left hand. Allison's other hand still holds the glass of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWithout warning, Allison suddenly smashes the glass on Hedra's\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThen the two girls start fighting for the gun. Allison slams\r\nHedra's hand on a mirror hanging on the wall. The glass of the\r\nmirror breaks into small pieces, but Hedra doesn't drop the gun.\r\n\r\nThe two girls keep on fighting on the floor, knocking various\r\nobject around them.\r\n\r\nClose up of Allison's hand holding Hedra's hand with the gun, and\r\nsmashing it through the window. The pane breaks into small pieces,\r\nand Hedra drops the gun on the balcony.\r\nHedra moves away from Allison.\r\n\r\nClose up of Allison's hand picking up a piece of glass lying near\r\nthe gun on the balcony.\r\n\r\nAllison slashes Hedra's chest with the broken piece of glass.\r\nHedra falls on the floor and Allison rushes out of the room.\r\n\r\nHedra gets up and picks up the gun from the balcony.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison is fumbling with the locks and the safety bar of the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nHedra rushes into the corridor, pointing her gun at Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie !\r\n\r\nAllison has opened the door and turns around to face Hedra.\r\nHedra walks slowly along the corridor towards Allison.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Please...\r\n\r\nAllison still has the piece of broken glass in her hand.\r\n\r\nBehind Hedra, we see Graham moving in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Please...\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot to Allison standing in the open doorway and\r\nholding the piece of broken glass.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not any more. I'm like you\r\n       now.\r\n\r\nClose up on the barrel of the gun.\r\n\r\nGraham rushes out of the bathroom, grabs Hedra by the waist and\r\nfalls with her on the floor.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Graham !\r\n\r\nGraham bangs Hedra's head repeatedly on the floor. Hedra succeeds\r\nin moving slightly away from him, and try to point her gun toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'll kill you !\r\n\r\nAllison rushes towards them, grabs Hedra by her feet, and pulls\r\nher towards the front door. Hedra, still lying on her stomach\r\nwhile being pulled away by Allison, still tries desperately to\r\npoint her gun towards Graham.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Get off him !\r\n\r\nAllison succeeds in pulling Hedra out of the apartment. Hedra\r\ngrabs the front door with both hands to try to resist Allison's\r\npull.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -\r\nINTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by\r\nthe door. She screams. Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close\r\nthe door shut.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON\r\n       Graham, stay inside !\r\n\r\n       GRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment)\r\n       All right.\r\nAllison runs away towards the elevator. Hedra, still lying on the\r\nfloor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots.\r\n\r\nAllison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder. Hedra\r\nshoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nHedra gets up to run after Allison.\r\n\r\nClose up on the elevator. Allison is already inside the cabin and\r\ncloses the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No... No... No...\r\n\r\nAllison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the\r\ninner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard.\r\nHedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor. Allison closes\r\nthe inner door shut.\r\n\r\nClose up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       No... No... No...\r\n\r\nHedra watches the outer door closing slowly.\r\n\r\nAllison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger\r\nseveral times. But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge\r\nin the chamber of the gun.\r\n\r\nHedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator. Allison tries\r\nto prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in\r\ngetting into the cabin. She closes the inner door, and the outer\r\ndoor closes itself automatically.\r\nHedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin. Then she bangs\r\nher head very hard against the wall. Allison pulls Hedra away from\r\nher. Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls\r\non the floor. Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes\r\nher away from her.\r\n\r\nThe two girls start fighting in the cabin. They fall on the floor,\r\nHedra on top of Allison. Hedra tries to strangle Allison.\r\n\r\nClose up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nShort reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to\r\nAllison's face.\r\n\r\nClose up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking\r\ngently with the movement of the elevator. Allison's hand tries to\r\ncatch it and doesn't succeed.\r\n\r\nBack on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's\r\nstrangulation. Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand\r\ntrying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating\r\nface.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the\r\nscrewdriver, then back to her face. The face slowly relaxes as\r\nAllison falls into unconsciousness. Her arm, which was extended to\r\ncatch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin.\r\n\r\nHedra watches Allison's face intently. Then, when she realizes\r\nthat Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the\r\ncheek. She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then\r\nshe puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThe outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical\r\nbars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back\r\non the floor of the cabin. Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls\r\nAllison by the legs out of the elevator.\r\n\r\n        HEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison)\r\n        Huh... Huh...\r\n\r\nShe pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement.\r\n\r\nShe reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks\r\nit shut.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the\r\nfloor. She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's\r\nface in it.\r\n\r\nShe pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the\r\nwall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to\r\nprevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase.\r\n\r\nThen she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the\r\ncage where the elevator machinery is enclosed. We supposed it is\r\nthe emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to\r\nprevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts\r\nthem inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra pushes the empty wheelbarrow along the corridor of the\r\nbasement.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stops, drops the wheelbarrow and emits a short\r\nscream.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot on the green blanket on the floor. Allison is\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHedra looks very worried.\r\n\r\n        HEDRA\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nShe runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to\r\nthe elevator. She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then\r\ntries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (yelling)\r\n       Allie ?\r\n\r\nShe goes back along the corridor the way she came from. Near the\r\nplace where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked\r\n\u00abStorage\u00bb, and opens it\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Hey, here you are.\r\n\r\nBut this is just a closet full of various junk.\r\n\r\nHedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around. She\r\ntakes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking\r\nmenacingly along the corridor.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come\r\n       on... Allie !...\r\n\r\nShe bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall.\r\n\r\nClose up on a rat scuttling away from the noise.\r\n\r\nClose up on Allie hidden in a big metal box, near the ceiling of\r\nthe basement. This metal box is obviously a part of the\r\nventilation system.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Come on !\r\nThe rat is running along a large horizontal pipe towards Allison,\r\nwho seems frightened by it.\r\n\r\nHigh angle shot of Hedra seen from Allison's hiding place.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (screaming)\r\n       Come out now !\r\n\r\nClose up on Allison's face, frightened by the rat.\r\n\r\nReverse angle close up shot of the rat coming towards us and\r\nAllison.\r\n\r\nBack to Allison looking at the rat.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Allie, please.\r\n\r\nHigh angle shot of Hedra. She is crying.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       I'm scared ! Where are you ?\r\nThe rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down\r\nfrom the pipe where it was standing.\r\n\r\nThe rat falls on Hedra's shoulder. She screams.\r\n\r\nAllison hides back into the ventilation metal box not to be seen\r\nby Hedra.\r\n\r\nHedra throws the rat on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe rat runs away.\r\n\r\nHedra looks up at the place where the rat fell from.\r\n\r\nClose up at Allison's hiding place. The metal box seems empty.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA (voice over)\r\n       Allie...\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nHedra comes back into the incinerator room. Just above the open\r\ndoor of the incinerator, there is a big ventilation metal box,\r\nsimilar to the one Allison is hiding in.\r\n\r\nHedra bangs the box with her hook. She must think that Allison is\r\ncrawling inside the ventilation system.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nAllison is peeking from behind a corner of the corridor.\r\n\r\nReverse angle shot showing what Allison sees. We - and she - see\r\nthe incinerator room with Hedra banging her hook on the\r\nventilation system.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\nHedra is walking backward, away from the incinerator. She hears a\r\nstrange noise and turns around.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nWe see the open door of a cage slightly moving with a squeaking\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nHedra walks toward the cage.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Why are you hiding from me ?\r\n\r\nClose up on a big wooden closet with two doors. A piece of green\r\nfabric is sticking out between the two closed doors.\r\n\r\nHedra bangs her hook on the closet.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is\r\n       sticking out of it.\r\nShe opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the\r\ncloset, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror\r\nand breaks it.\r\n\r\nHedra backs up one step from the closet. And suddenly, Allison,\r\nwho was hiding in the pipework on the ceiling, falls down upside\r\ndown, hanging from her legs hooked in the pipework. She stabs\r\nHedra in the back with the elevator screwdriver. Hedra screams,\r\nand tries to take the screwdriver off her back.\r\n\r\nAllison drops on the floor. Hedra tries to hit her with the hook,\r\nbut Allison grabs her arm.\r\n\r\nWith her other free hand, Allison pulls the screwdriver out of\r\nHedra's back, then immediately sticks it again in another place on\r\nHedra's back.\r\n\r\n       HEDRA\r\n       Allie...\r\n\r\nHedra slowly falls on the floor, where she remains motionless.\r\n\r\nAllison looks down at her, trying to catch her breath back.\r\n\r\nShe kneels down to close Hedra's eyelids.\r\n\r\nBLACK SCREEN\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.\r\n\r\nALLISON'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n\r\nThis is Allison's new place. Actually it is the apartment Allison\r\nvisited with Sam, just before the puppy's death.\r\n\r\nSome furniture from the old apartment, and a lot of unopened boxes\r\non the floor. It looks like if Allison just moved in.\r\n\r\nVery large windows overlooking New-York. Allison is standing near\r\none of the windows, with her back toward us.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to\r\n       start letting go. He's right.\r\n\r\nClose up on Hedra's collection of photographs, lying near the\r\nshoebox where she used to stock them. In the forefront, the black\r\nand white picture of Hedra and her twin sister holding a dog\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n       Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain\r\n       her that her sister's death wasn't her fault.\r\n\r\nWe see Allison's hands taking the pictures one by one.\r\n\r\n       ALLISON (voice over)\r\n          But she never forgave herself for surviving.\r\n\r\nThe last picture she takes is the black and white picture of the\r\ntwins with the dog. She puts all the pictures back in the shoebox,\r\nwith the twins and dog picture on the top.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON (voice over)\r\n          So every day, I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.\r\n\r\nAllison puts the lid back on the shoebox.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON (voice over)\r\n          Then I try to do what she couldn't... Forgive myself.\r\n\r\nThe camera moves slowly away from the shoebox to a last photograph\r\nhidden underneath some wrapping plastic material.\r\n\r\n          ALLISON (voice over)\r\n          I know what can happen to someone who doesn't.\r\n\r\nClose up on the picture. It looks like the picture of the face of\r\none woman. But actually, the picture is a mixture of two pictures.\r\nThe left half-side of the picture shows Allison's face, when the\r\nright half-side shows Hedra's face.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nThe credit are rolling up on the picture of Hedra / Allison for\r\nabout 25 seconds, then fade-out to black screen, where the end of\r\nthe credits are rolling up.\r\n\n\n\n\nSingle White Female\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Don Roos\u00a0\u00a0John Lutz\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:35:45.073328"}
