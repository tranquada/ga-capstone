He and Jay \n               nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking \n               up at the menu board.\n\n<b>                                     JAY\n</b>                         That'll fucking show 'em.

A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all \n               in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in \n               the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.\n\n               She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.\n\n               Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then \n               at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's \n               eyes, getting zero response.\n\n<b>               JAY'S POV\n</b>\n               The Girl smiles at us.

He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss \n               on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager \n               to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous \n               with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.\n\n               But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to \n               Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls \n               his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it \n               over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She \n               smiles at the zombified Jay.\n\n<b>                                     GIRL\n</b>                              (off cup)\n                         Oh my God.

When she passes \n               the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, \n               arms in the air like a gymnast.
