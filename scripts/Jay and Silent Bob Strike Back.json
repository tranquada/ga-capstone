QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY\n\n               We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from \n               sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- \n               a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A \n               white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap \n               comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an \n               oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, \n               and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in \n               the Mother's hands.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks \n                         up the free cheese, 'kay?\n\n               She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, \n               then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her \n               baseball cap and places it on the baby.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         This'll keep the sun out of your \n                         eyes. You be good now.\n\n               She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. \n               With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his \n               mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks \n               kind of familiar.\n\n               Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS \n               concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair \n               enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. \n               She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets \n               her Baby down beside him.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Don't fucking move, you little shit-\n                         machine.

Fuck!\n\n               The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. \n               Then, they look at each other.

He climbs over Jay into the \n               aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and \n               registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on. \n\n               Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches \n               for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts \n               punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his \n               seat, trying to look nonchalant.

Silent \n               Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his \n               mouth.

Five hours \n                         and not a single ride. Every day, \n                         millions of people hitch to Hollywood \n                         and stop studios from making movies \n                         about 'em.

Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug, \n               and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.\n\n               INT.

Through their stoned haze, \n               we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling \n               about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken \n               off to reveal a man inside a costume.\n\n               Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint \n               and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total \n               debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy \n               cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish \n               and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other. \n               The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--\n\n                                     GREAT DANE\n                         Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob\n\n               The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking \n               way out of its sheath.

KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY\n\n               Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as \n               well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see \n               the scar. It's not there.\n\n                                     JAY\n                         Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.\n                              (looks around)\n                         Yo, I'm hungry.

A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all \n               in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in \n               the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.\n\n               She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.\n\n               Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then \n               at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's \n               eyes, getting zero response.\n\n               JAY'S POV\n\n               The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to \n               her breasts, then down to her crotch.\n\n               Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle \n               of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss \n               on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager \n               to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous \n               with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.\n\n               But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to \n               Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls \n               his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it \n               over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She \n               smiles at the zombified Jay.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                              (off cup)\n                         Oh my God.

At the \n               other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.\n\n               Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays \n               the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, \n               which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, \n               within the mist, laser beams become apparent.\n\n               Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few \n               steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs \n               forward and does an impressive series of flips down the \n               hallway, not touching a single laser beam.\n\n               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\n               Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of \n               the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture \n               to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series \n               of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.\n\n               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\n               Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to \n               Chrissy.\n\n               Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, \n               Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.\n\n               Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are \n               even more impressive than the other two, including running \n               up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes \n               the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, \n               arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, \n               manly FART.\n\n               The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING \n               through the building.\n\n                                     CHRISSY\n                         Holy fuck--the little stoner was \n                         right--\n\n               Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds.

Cock-Knocker then pulls a \n               vibrator-looking device from his cape.

He reached his \n               hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.\n\n               Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. \n               The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive \n               pose.

At least Holden had the \n                         good sense to keep his name off of \n                         it.\n\n                                     TRISH\n                         Why wouldn't Miramax option his other \n                         comic instead? You know--the one he \n                         drew about you and him and your \n                         relationship?\n\n                                     ALYSSA\n                         You mean Chasing Amy? That would \n                         never work as a movie.\n\n               BANKY and HOOPER exit.\n\n                                     BANKY\n                         I'm so fucking embarrassed--\n\n                                     HOOPER\n                         Honey, you should be. They took your \n                         characters and reduced them to one \n                         ninety-minute-long-gay joke.

Cradle the \n                         balls and work the shaft!\"\n\n                                     BANKY\n                              (looking around)\n                         Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in \n                         public!\n\n               A guy behind them calls out to Banks.\n\n                                     GUY\n                         Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!\n\n                                     BANKY\n                              (recognizing him)\n                         You--!\n\n                                     GUY\n                         That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm \n                         back for round two!\n\n               Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, \n               while Hooper tries to break them up.\n\n               WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a \n               prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.\n\n                                     WILLENHOLLY\n                         You know, I don't get out to the \n                         movies much. But I'd have to say \n                         Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!\n\n                                     JUSTICE\n                         Are these leg cuffs really necessary?\n\n                                     WILLENHOLLY\n                         Don't make me shoot you, Justice.\n\n               And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.\n\n                                     JAY\n                         YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET, \n                         FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE \n                         WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!\n\n               WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing \n               \"The Bird.\" During the song, Morris points to--\n\n               Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's \n               still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob, \n               they nod at each other and--\n\n               Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage, \n               and dance us out to the coda, which reads--\n\n               CODA\n\n               Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 \n               million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial \n               failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly \n               drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat \n               boards, and over the course of the next year, while they \n               waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay \n               and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out \n               of them.\n\n               CREDITS. THEN--\n\n               INT. NOWHERE\n\n               A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW \n               ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips \n               off.\n\n               THE END\n\n\n\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kevin Smith\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:17.679893"}
