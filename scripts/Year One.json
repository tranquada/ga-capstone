Then a MAN rises\n          up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the\n          surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect--\n          short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace.\n          It's paradise-- for him.\n\n          THE WOMAN\n          (looking deep in his eyes)\n          I'm so hungry.\n\n          THE MAN\n          (wanting her)\n          Yeah. Me, too.\n          The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to\n          kiss her, but she turns and walks away.\n\n          WOMAN\n          What should we eat?\n\n          THE MAN\n          Oh, you actually meant you were\n          hungry.

One-- two-- three!\n          Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him\n          out and stops before her teeth break the skin.\n          ZED                                                             (cont'd)\n          (with his mouth full)\n          Got me.

That's horrible. Yecch,\n          ptui! Ughh.\n          He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his\n          fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out.\n\n          MAYA\n          So you're saying it's not good?\n\n          ZED\n          Yes! I'm saying it's not good!\n          He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a\n          loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up.\n          ZED                                                             (cont'd)\n          Oh, no--\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                                                          6.\n          Official White\n          He runs for the bushes.

VILLAGE - DAY\n\n          A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a\n          mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread        CO\n          and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a\n          celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR\n          on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs\n          in honor of the kill.\n          The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony,\n          Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops\n          it at Maya's feet.\n\n          MARLAK\n          (blunt grunt)\n          For you.\n\n          MAYA\n          (forces a grateful smile)\n          Thank you, Marlak.\n\n          4\n\n          4                                                               ZED'S HUT\n          Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut,\n          his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him\n          sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy,\n          jealous of the attention they're getting from the women.\n          If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar\n          opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would\n          apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He\n          may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been\n          invented he'd be wearing them.\n\n          OH\n\n          (GRUMBLING)\n          Look at them. Hunters think\n          they're so cool. They don't think\n          gathering is dangerous? There are\n          thorns-- bees-- those big stingy\n          ants. I could hunt-- I just don't\n          want to. And what's with the blood\n          on their faces?

Maya was\n          just staring at me with those pouty\n          eyes-- and those perky breasts--\n          opposable thumbs. And how about\n          the name? \"The Tree of the\n          Knowledge of Good and Evil\"? You\n          don't think that sounds tempting?\n          They should've just called it \"The\n          Tree with the Fruit that Tastes\n          Like Shit.\" Then for sure nobody\n          would eat it.\n          Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind\n          his dwelling.\n          ZED                                                             (cont'd)\n          (shouts testily)\n          Hey!
