TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tAn afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the\n\ttrees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches.\n\tThe garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a\n\thigh brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story\n\tbrick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building.\n\tCLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely\n\tdressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the\n\tgarden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth\n\tas he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works\n\tslowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings.\n\tThis man is called CHANCE.\n\n\tChance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from\n\tinside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening\n\tskies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts\n\ttoward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag\n\tfrom his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of\n\this pitchfork.\n\n<b>\tINT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tThe sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage\n\tfrom the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as\n\the walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a\n\twall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf,\n\tcarefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the\n\tcar for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the\n\tgarage through a side entry.\n\n<b>\tINT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tThe Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener,\n\teverything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots\n\tare on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A\n\tsmall, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a\n\tshelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA.\n\tAttached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing\n\tcolored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of\n\tcolor TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the\n\ttelevision set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the\n\tpitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and\n\tleaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tA room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote\n\tcontrol color television set dominates the room. It is on,\n\ttuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest\n\tof the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with\n\texpensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books,\n\tmagazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be\n\tseen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as\n\the removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote\n\tcontrol as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a\n\tlaundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the\n\tcloset where it is accompanied by several others, all of like\n\tquality. Chance changes the channel once again.\n\n<b>\tEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tChance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry\n\tbag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tThe interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the\n\twarmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the\n\tfurniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tA large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs.\n\tIt is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and\n\tplace setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to\n\tthe place setting.\n\n\tChance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near\n\tthe doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the\n\tTV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as\n\the watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters\n\twith a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE\n</b>\t\t\t(sets dinner before\n\t\t\t\tChance)\n\t\t... Evening, Chance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(slowly, perfect diction,\n\t\t\t\tno accent of any kind)\n\t\t... Good evening, Louise.\n\n\tLouise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks\n\tup his laundry bag.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t... The Old Man is getting weaker,\n\t\tChance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(begins to eat)\n\t\tI see.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tI'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with\n\t\tevery hour that goes by...\n\n\tChance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he\n\teats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t... Back up those stairs - damn...\n\t\tThat Man's needin' me more and more\n\t\tjust before he never needs me\n\t\tagain...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(still watches TV)\n\t\tIs his back feeling better?\n\n\tLouise gives Chance a look.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t... Gobbledegook... You and your\n\t\tgobbledegook. You're gonna be the\n\t\tdeath of me yet, Chance...\n\t\t\t(she turns to leave)\n\t\t... Unless those stairs are... The\n\t\tGood Lord's liable to snatch up two\n\t\tunwillin' souls at the same time if\n\t\tI keep on trampin' up those\n\t\tstairs... I don't want none of\n\t\tthat...\n\n\tLouise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to\n\teat and watch TV.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN\n</b>\n\tChance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open,\n\tand, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on\n\tthe TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes\n\tto the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer,\n\tchecks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never\n\tstraying from an early morning show on television. He puts on\n\ta bathrobe and leaves the room.\n\n<b>\tINT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN\n</b>\n\tChance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel,\n\tthen waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns\n\toff the TV and exits.\n\n<b>\tINT. GARAGE - DAWN\n</b>\n\tChance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the\n\ttouring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the\n\tgarage.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN\n</b>\n\tChance returns to his room, changes channels on the\n\ttelevision, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the\n\tcloset, then goes into the bathroom.\n\n<b>\tEXT. GARDEN - MORNING\n</b>\n\tA light snow is falling. The door to the small building\n\topens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds\n\tpass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella.\n\tSmartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main\n\thouse.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING\n</b>\n\tChance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella\n\tbefore entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then\n\theads for the dining room.\n\n<b>\tINT. DINING ROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n\tRepeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits,\n\tturns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He\n\twatches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting\n\tLouise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV.\n\tAfter a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying\n\tdown the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly\n\tdistraught. Chance looks up, smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\tGood morning, Louise.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t\t(out of breath)\n\t\tHe's dead, Chance! The Old Man's\n\t\tdead!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(flatly, turns back to TV)\n\t\t... I see.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tMust of happened durin' the night,\n\t\tI don't know... Lord, he wasn't\n\t\tbreathin' and as cold as a fish. I\n\t\ttouched him, just to see, and you\n\t\tbelieve me, Chance - that's doin'\n\t\tmore than I get paid to do... Then\n\t\tI just covered him up, pulled the\n\t\tsheet over his head...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tYes. I've seen that done.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE\n</b>\t\tThen I got the hell out of that\n\t\troom and called the doctor and I\n\t\tthink I woke him probably, he\n\t\twasn't any too alert. He just said,\n\t\t'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and\n\t\tsaid he'd send somebody over...'\n\t\tLord, what a mornin'!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(watches news, flashes of\n\t\t\t\tseason's first snowfall)\n\t\t... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in\n\t\tthe garden today. Have you looked\n\t\toutside and seen the snow? It's\n\t\tvery white.\n\n\tA beat of silence from Louise, then anger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tDammit, Boy! Is that all you got to\n\t\tsay? More gobbledegook? \n\t\t\t(Chance smiles, is silent)\n\t\tThat Old Man's layin' up there dead\n\t\tas hell and it just don't make any\n\t\tdifference to you!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(with a smile, accepting\n\t\t\t\tdeath)\n\t\tYes, Louise. I have seen it often.\n\t\tIt happens to old people.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tWell, ain't that the truth...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\tYes. It is.\n\n\tLouise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and\n\tsits, softening a bit toward him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tOh, Lord, Chance - I don't know\n\t\twhat I was expectin' from you...\n\t\tI'm sorry for yellin' like I did...\n\t\tNo sir, I just don't know what I\n\t\twas expectin' ... \n\t\t\t(Chance doesn't react,\n\t\t\t\twatches TV)\n\t\t... I 'spose I'd better gather up\n\t\tsome breakfast for you...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(a turn to her)\n\t\tYes, I'm very hungry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t\t(rises, looks upstairs)\n\t\tWell, no more stewin' those prunes\n\t\tevery mornin', that's somethin', I\n\t\tguess... \n\t\t\t(she starts out, stops by\n\t\t\t\tthe door)\n\t\t... what are you goin' to do now,\n\t\tChance?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE\n</b>\t\t\t(gazing at TV)\n\t\tI'm going to work in the garden.\n\n\tLouise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE\n</b>\t\t\t(as she goes)\n\t\t... I'll get you some eggs.\n\n\tChance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING\n</b>\n\tAn enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING\n</b>\n\tChance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase.\n\tHe moves off down the hall.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n\tThe furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the\n\tOld Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance\n\tenters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed,\n\twe sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit\n\tof curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a\n\tmoment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back\n\tfrom the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead,\n\tlightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to\n\tthe TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He\n\tsits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a\n\tmovie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests\n\tit on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes\n\tthe channels with the remote control.\n\tHe returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to\n\tbecome absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat\n\tto a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.\n\n<b>\tEXT. GARDEN - MORNING\n</b>\n\tIt has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening\n\tapron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise\n\tcomes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf\n\tover her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to\n\tLouise exactly like the man he saw on television.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t... Well, ain't you the gentleman\n\t\tthis mornin'...\n\t\t\t(a pause)\n\t\t... gotta go now, Chance...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(resumes working)\n\t\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\tYou're gonna need somebody,\n\t\tsomeone's gotta be around for you,\n\t\tboy... \n\t\t\t(he keeps working)\n\t\t... You oughta find yourself a\n\t\tlady, Chance... \n\t\t\t(she smiles slightly, with\n\t\t\t\tcaring)\n\t\tBut I guess it oughta be an old\n\t\tlady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a\n\t\tyoung one any good, not with that\n\t\tlittle thing of yours... \n\t\t\t(she reaches out, puts a\n\t\t\t\thand on his shoulder)\n\t\t... You're always gonna be a little\n\t\tboy, ain't you? \n\t\t\t(he smiles, keeps working)\n\t\t... Goodbye, Chance...\n\n\tLouise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward\n\tthe house.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(as she goes)\n\t\tGoodbye, Louise.\n\n\tLouise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat\n\tonce again as she disappears.\n\n<b>\tINT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING\n</b>\n\tLouise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases\n\twaiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white\n\tcarrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the\n\tease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the\n\tstairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE \n</b>\t\t... He used to be a big man...\n\t\t'Spose he wasted away to about\n\t\tnothin'... \n\t\t\t(a beat - then she talks\n\t\t\t\tto the body of the old\n\t\t\t\tMan)\n\t\t... I guess I'll be goin' off to\n\t\tfind me some folks, Old Man... I'm\n\t\tnot batty enough to stay around\n\t\tthis neighborhood any longer...\n\n\tThe stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in\n\tfront of them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUISE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t\t(to stretcher bearers)\n\t\tWait up! I'm goin' out that door\n\t\tfirst.\n\n\tLouise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens\n\tthe front door, leaves.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He\n\tfinishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house\n\tslippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves\n\tthe room.\n\n<b>\tEXT. GARDEN - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of\n\tfresh snow to the townhouse.\n\n<b>\tINT. DINING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place.\n\tHe turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV\n\tfor a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not\n\tappear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views\n\ta wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement,\n\the again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage\n\tof the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign\n\tdignitaries at the White House.\n\tCLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a\n\ttwo-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously,\n\tChance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming\n\tto have 'sunk into' his mind.\n\n<b>\tINT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\n\tA key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS\n\tFRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in\n\this late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is\n\tyounger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase,\n\thas the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to\n\tbe surprised at the interior of the house.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYES\n</b>\t\t\t(looks around)\n\t\t... This is another world, Tom - I\n\t\tnever would have believed it...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\tYeah... He and my father used to\n\t\tride together back in the\n\t\tthirties... Fox hunting... Before I\n\t\twas born...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYES \n</b>\t\t... Would you take me on a tour?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\tGladly... \n\t\t\t(he smiles)\n\t\t... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'\n\t\tbedroom, that'll be stop number\n\t\tone.\n\n\tFranklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down\n\tthe hall.\n\n<b>\tINT. DINING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him.\n\tFranklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room.\n\tThey are both surprised to see Chance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\t... Why... Hello, we thought we\n\t\theard something... \n\t\t\t(moves to Chance, hand\n\t\t\t\toutstretched)\n\t\tI'm Thomas Franklin.\n\n\tChance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both\n\tof his like the President did on TV.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\tHello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the\n\t\tgardener.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\t... The gardener? \n\t\t\t(thinks it's a joke,\n\t\t\t\tlaughs)\n\t\t... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,\n\t\tthis is Ms. Hayes.\n\n\tHayes moves to shake Chance's hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYES \n</b>\t\tMr. Chance, I'm very pleased to\n\t\tmeet you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(doesn't rise, again\n\t\t\t\tshakes with both hands)\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tChance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange\n\tlooks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\t\t(after an uneasy pause)\n\t\t... We're with Franklin, Jennings\n\t\tand Roberts, the law firm handling\n\t\tthe estate.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\t\t(a smile, totally at ease)\n\t\tYes, Thomas - I understand.\n\n\tAnother period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\t... Are you waiting for someone? An\n\t\tappointment?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\tYes. I'm waiting for my lunch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANKLIN \n</b>\t\tYour lunch? You have a luncheon\n\t\tappointment here?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHANCE \n</b>\t\tYes.

Chance tries to return\n\tto the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He\n\tstands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash\n\tladen sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally\n\tmakes up his mind and moves off to his left.\n\n<b>\tEXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tThe buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street.\n\tA group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed\n\tfurniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for\n\twarmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands\n\tby them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in\n\ttheir faces.

REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK\n</b>\n\tTourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the\n\tWhite House.\n\tChance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a\n\tdying tree.

Expensive shops, well-kept streets and\n\tsidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He\n\tstands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color\n\tTVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera\n\tpoints outward from a corner of the window and is focused on\n\tthe sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves\n\tlive on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image.\n\tHe poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it\n\tis really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then\n\tmoves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the\n\tscreen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness\n\tdisappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two\n\tparked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it\n\tat the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change\n\tchannels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he\n\tdoes this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made\n\tlimousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against\n\tthe car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his\n\tsuitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the\n\tlimo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,\n\timmediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAVID\n</b>\t\tI'm very sorry, sir...

Huddled\n\ttogether at one end of the hall are six important\n\tbusinessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a\n\tpowerful industrialist, speaks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDUDLEY \n</b>\t\tBut what do we know of the man?\n\t\tNothing! We have no inkling of his\n\t\tpast!\n\n\tSEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNELSON \n</b>\t\tCorrect, and that is an asset. A\n\t\tman's past can cripple him, his\n\t\tbackground turns into a swamp and\n\t\tinvites scrutiny.\n\n\tAnother executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCALDWELL \n</b>\t\tTo this time, he hasn't said\n\t\tanything that could be used against\n\t\thim.\n\n\tCHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENNET \n</b>\t\tWell, I'm certainly open to the\n\t\tthought - it would be sheer lunacy\n\t\tto support the President for\n\t\tanother term.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNELSON \n</b>\t\tNo one will go along with that...\n\t\tLook at the facts, gentlemen, the\n\t\tresponse from his appearance on\n\t\t'This Evening' was overwhelming; he\n\t\thas excited and awakened the people\n\t\tof this country at a time of\n\t\tdespair.\n\n\tLYMAN MURRAY, a banker;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMURRAY \n</b>\t\tHe's personable, elusive, yet\n\t\tseemingly honest. He's riding a\n\t\tcrest of popularity that builds\n\t\twith every statement. As far as his\n\t\tthinking goes, he appears to be one\n\t\tof us. I firmly believe, gentlemen,\n\t\tthat he is our only chance - Mr.\n\t\tChauncey Gardiner!\n\n<b>\tEXT. WOODS - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.\n\n<b>\tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President\n\tand the First Lady.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\tIt was very moving, Bobby - thank\n\t\tyou so much...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tWe're all going to miss him, Eve... \n\t\t\t(glances around)\n\t\t...

WOODS - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery.\n\tHe stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves\n\ton.\n\n<b>\tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk\n\tslowly to the RAND 1 limousine, look around for Chance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVE \n</b>\t\t... Do you think we should look for\n\t\thim?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALLENBY \n</b>\t\tI don't think so, he should be\n\t\talong soon...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVE \n</b>\t\tI wish he were here...\n\n\tEve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine.\n\n<b>\tEXT. WOODS - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the\n\tground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along\n\tthe split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that\n\tan end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it\n\tdouble. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the\n\tseedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and,\n\twith gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the\n\tseedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the\n\tlarger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.\n\tHe unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way\n\tto give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light\n\tfrom the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on\n\tand continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of\n\tthe woods.\n\n<b>\tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY\n</b>\n\tJeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the\n\tother cars have gone. Eve is worried, gets into the car.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

WOODS - DAY\n</b>\n\tChance walks with determination through the woods.\n\n<b>\tINT. LIMOUSINE - DAY\n</b>\n\tAllenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a\n\tnarrow road through the woods. Jeffrey, sitting in front,\n\tsuddenly calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEFFREY \n</b>\t\tLook!\n\n\tAbout 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road,\n\tcontinues on down a hill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVE \n</b>\t\tThere he is!

I've been looking for you,\n\t\ttoo, Eve.\n\n\tShe hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the\n\thill to the waiting limousine. Allenby gets out of the car,\n\tgreets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the\n\tshoulder.
