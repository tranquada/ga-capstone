The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,\r\n          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just\r\n          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville\r\n          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,\r\n          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).\r\n\r\n          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg\r\n          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small \"r\" burned into his\r\n          cheek (\"r\" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which\r\n          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.\r\n\r\n          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery\r\n          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering\r\n          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet\r\n          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the\r\n          skin off ankles.\r\n\r\n          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.\r\n          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the\r\n          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most\r\n          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters\r\n          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the\r\n          Greenville Auction.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the\r\n          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.\r\n\r\n          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,\r\n          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he\r\n          hears the Auctioneer yell; \"Sold.\" Then she's taken away to whereabouts\r\n          unknown, never to be seen again.\r\n\r\n          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;\r\n\r\n          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN\r\n          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed\r\n          for forty.\r\n\r\n          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him\r\n          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area\r\n          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the\r\n          structure.\r\n\r\n          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front\r\n          of the auction block.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         2\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS\r\n          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing\r\n          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on\r\n          the block.\r\n          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full\r\n          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white\r\n          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.\r\n\r\n          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK\r\n          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on\r\n          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to\r\n          buy Niggers, who look up to him.\r\n          His heart fills with poison.\r\n\r\n          BACK TO DJANGO\r\n          walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the\r\n          blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.\r\n\r\n          THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE\r\n          end.\r\n\r\n\r\n          /--\" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing\r\n          their black skinned cargo forward.\r\n          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to\r\n          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed\r\n          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on\r\n          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.\r\n          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,\r\n          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the\r\n          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and\r\n          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,\r\n          resemble a human locomotive.\r\n          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck\r\n          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white\r\n          fur collars.\r\n\r\n          WHEN...\r\n          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This\r\n          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their\r\n          rifles for possible trouble.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         3\r\n\r\n          A BLACK HORSE\r\n          carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the\r\n          foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.\r\n\r\n                         THE RIDER\r\n          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey\r\n          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler\r\n          hat on his head.\r\n\r\n                         DICKY SPECK\r\n          Who's that stumblin around in the dark?\r\n          State your business, or prepare to get\r\n          winged!\r\n\r\n                         THE RIDER\r\n          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no\r\n          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.\r\n          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front\r\n          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his\r\n          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.\r\n\r\n                         THE RIDER\r\n          (to the Slavers)\r\n          Good cold evening gentlemen.\r\n          (to the shivering Slaves)\r\n          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of\r\n          slave traders that go by the'name of\r\n          The Speck Brothers.

I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this\r\n          is my horse, Fritz.\r\n          Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught\r\n          him.\r\n\r\n                         DICKY SPECK\r\n          You a doctor?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Affirmative.\r\n\r\n                         DICKY SPECK\r\n          What kinda doctor?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Dentist.

Is there one among\r\n          you, who was formerly a resident of\r\n          The Carrucan Plantation?\r\n          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second\r\n          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a\r\n          VOICE rings out;\r\n\r\n          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)\r\n          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.\r\n          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his\r\n          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Splendid!

How much for Django?\r\n\r\n                         DICKY SPECK\r\n          800 dollars!\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in\r\n          the slave trade that you and your family does,\r\n          but neither was I born yesterday.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         8\r\n          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked\r\n          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says\r\n          that the going rate for African flesh'\r\n          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty\r\n          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as\r\n          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.\r\n          Which according to\"this pamphlet here - and\r\n          why would they lie - puts his price at\r\n          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how\r\n          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for\r\n          young Django here.\r\n          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a\r\n          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          And since your late brother. won't be using\r\n          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.\r\n          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on\r\n          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags\r\n          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and\r\n          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.\r\n          Django is free.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good\r\n          rubbing, then get up on that horse.\r\n          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter\r\n          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.\r\n          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket\r\n          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.\r\n          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a\r\n          bill of sale. Do you have one?\r\n          Dicky just curses him.\r\n          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.\r\n          (as he writes)\r\n          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.\r\n          (he stops, then\r\n          says to Django)\r\n          Django is spelled with a silent \"D\",\r\n          is it not?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         9\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Huh?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Why not..\r\n          He writes it in his book with a silent \"D\", then stops to admire the\r\n          way it looks.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes, that does add a little character.\r\n          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down\r\n          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your\r\n          mark here.\r\n          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor\r\n          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.\r\n          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.\r\n          He signs the bill of sale.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a\r\n          pleasure doing business with you, but your\r\n          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.\r\n          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in\r\n          leg irons.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Now as to you poor devils.\r\n          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject\r\n          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two\r\n          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that\r\n          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him\r\n          to the nearest town. Which would be at least\r\n          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.\r\n          Or ...\r\n          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that\r\n          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,\r\n          bury the two of them deep, and make your way\r\n          to a more enlightened area of the country.\r\n          The choice is yours.\r\n          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         0\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Oh, and on the off chance that there's\r\n          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,\r\n          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.\r\n          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Just give him a little kick.\r\n          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          See, it's not so difficult.\r\n\r\n          EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE\r\n          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses\r\n          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears\r\n          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress\r\n          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...\r\n          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Who?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Your horse?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          What horse?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ'\r\n          The horse you're riding.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          This ain't my horse.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes it is.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding\r\n          it.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -\r\n          technically not. If it's my horse, I can\r\n          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.\r\n          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,\r\n          congratulations.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         /1\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse\r\n          up in no stable.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n\r\n                         (FRUSTRATED)\r\n          Don't worry about all that!\r\n          They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...\r\n          then says with a smile;\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you\r\n          intend to name it? Half the fun of having\r\n          a horse is choosing his name. For instance\r\n          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,\r\n          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I\r\n          couldn't do without him.\r\n          (he pats Fritz's neck)\r\n          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't\r\n          something one does lightly. So once you've\r\n          thought about it for awhile -\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          - Tony.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          - Tony what?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          - I dunno, Tony the horse.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse\r\n          Tony?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.\r\n          Why Tony?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta\r\n          tell ya.\r\n          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a\r\n          western town. They pass by a sign that says; \"WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,\r\n\r\n                         TEXAS\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         /Z\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but\r\n          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact\r\n          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to\r\n          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it\r\n          well. Good job Django, well done.\r\n\r\n          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING\r\n          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz\r\n          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a\r\n          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the\r\n          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a\r\n          million other visitors.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          What's everybody staring at?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          What's this bizarre obsession they have\r\n          with. you not riding horses?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          You askin' me?\r\n          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has\r\n          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets\r\n          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          So what other archaic rituals are you people\r\n          verboten to take part in?\r\n          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; \"What\"?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what\r\n          you can do, and what you can't do, and if\r\n          you can't do it, why can't you do it?\r\n          Like for instance, what if we were to walk\r\n          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,\r\n          order a drink, and drink it?\r\n          Would the authorities frown on that?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          What part would they find the most offensive?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         13\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          All of it.

That's two hundred dollars, dead\r\n          or alive.\r\n\r\n                         MARSHALL TATUM\r\n          The hell you say!\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting\r\n          news.

SCHULTZ\r\n          I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative\r\n          of the criminal justice system of the\r\n          United States of America.

If they named\r\n          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of\r\n          a character in one of the most popular of\r\n          all the German legends.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes there is.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Do you know it?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Every German knows that story. Would you\r\n          like me to tell you?\r\n          Django nods his head, yes.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the\r\n          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.\r\n          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          What she do.?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys\r\n          him in some way. So at first he's just going to\r\n          obliterate her -\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Obliterate... . what does that mean?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Like blow up.\r\n          He pantomimes a explosion.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Phew, that's pretty mad.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a\r\n          little time, he calms down a bit. He's\r\n          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.\r\n          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he\r\n          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Broomhilda's on a mountain?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          It's a German legend, there's always going\r\n          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he\r\n          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a\r\n          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.\r\n          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.\r\n          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero\r\n          arises brave enough to save her.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Does a fella arise?\r\n          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he\r\n          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella\r\n          named, Sigfried.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Does Sigfried save her?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.\r\n          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by\r\n          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having\r\n          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his\r\n          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to\r\n          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's\r\n          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because\r\n          he's not afraid.of him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)\r\n          He walks through hellfire because\r\n          Broomhilda's worth. it.\r\n          After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass\r\n          as they nibble on their sandwiches.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          I know how he feels.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I think I'm just starting to realize that.\r\n          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he\r\n          thinks about what he's going to say next.\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will\r\n          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't\r\n          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.\r\n          Let me ask you a question, how do you like\r\n          the bounty hunting business?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?\r\n          What's not to like?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          I hafta admit, we make a good team.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'\r\n          Big John and Rodger?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad\r\n          overzealous. But normally, that's a good\r\n          thing. How'd you like to partner up for\r\n          the winter?\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          What'd ya mean partner up?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot\r\n          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some\r\n          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or\r\n          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything\r\n          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?\r\n          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.\r\n          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills\r\n          for the winter.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          You makin' another agreement?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         W7\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Yes. You work with me through the winter,\r\n          till the snow melts. I give you a third\r\n          of my bounties. And while we're together,\r\n          I'll teach you a few things you're going\r\n          to need to know.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that\r\n          head bow thing that Fritz can do?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          That among other things. We make some\r\n          money this winter, when the snow melts,\r\n          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and\r\n          we'll find where they sent your wife.\r\n          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?\r\n          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So\r\n          understandably, he's a little suspicious.\r\n\r\n                         DJANGO\r\n          Why you care what happens to me? Why you\r\n          care if I find my wife?\r\n          Dr.SCHULTZ\r\n          Well frankly, I've never given anybody\r\n          their freedom before. And now that I have,\r\n          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're\r\n          just not ready to go off on your own, it's\r\n          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.\r\n          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.\r\n          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm\r\n          obliged to help you on your quest to\r\n          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.\r\n          Django accepts that response.\r\n          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and\r\n          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal\r\n          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's\r\n          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace\r\n          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.\r\n\r\n                         WE SEE\r\n          A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches\r\n          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.\r\n          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going\r\n          to be good at this.\r\n\r\n          EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY\r\n          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have\r\n          been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named\r\n          PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long\r\n          case. They get to the top of the hill.

Some may consider the dues\r\n          excessive, but they're necessary for us to\r\n          create this haven for the alternative\r\n          lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.\r\n\r\n                         SCOTTY\r\n          Well said, and money well spent.\r\n          He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.\r\n          Candie sees this.\r\n\r\n                         CALVIN CANDIE\r\n          It would be.my pleasure, your first\r\n          weekend at the club, to join me and my\r\n          friends at my table.\r\n          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.\r\n          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.\r\n          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off\r\n          with a, \"Don't be silly.\"\r\n          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they\r\n          join the party.\r\n          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress\r\n          is a little more revealing then the others.\r\n          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But\r\n          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it\r\n          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go\r\n          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts\r\n          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's\r\n          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making\r\n          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.\r\n          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.\r\n\r\n                         NARRATOR (VO)\r\n          After excusing herself, she walked across\r\n          the street to her hotel room. She got\r\n          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she\r\n          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.\r\n          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets\r\n          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.\r\n          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her\r\n          to scratch his back next time.

As the game wore on, it came down\r\n          to a two thousand dollar pot between\r\n          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily\r\n          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.\r\n          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers\r\n          something in his ear.\r\n\r\n                         CANDIE\r\n\r\n                          (TO SHEBA)\r\n          Really?\r\n\r\n                         (TO SCOTTY)\r\n          You know what Sheba just tole me?\r\n          Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;\r\n\r\n                         SCOTTY\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         CANDIE\r\n          She says she thinks you're cute.\r\n\r\n                         SCOTTY\r\n          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're\r\n          beautiful.\r\n          Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.\r\n\r\n                         CANDIE\r\n          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little\r\n          lip. Want some lip?\r\n          Scotty, is a little surprised.\r\n\r\n                         SCOTTY\r\n          Well, she's your Pony...I mean...\r\n\r\n                         CANDIE\r\n          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween\r\n          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.\r\n          Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip\r\n          intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to\r\n          Calvin's side of the table.\r\n          The game continues.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         G\r\n\r\n                         CANDIE\r\n          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out\r\n          brazen me in my own club, and I won't have\r\n          it.

Calvin Candie and his sister\r\n          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.\r\n          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES\r\n          picking it.\r\n          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,\r\n          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio\r\n          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...\r\n          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way\r\n          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and\r\n          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.\r\n          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django\r\n          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.\r\n          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out\r\n          Django.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         90\r\n          All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to\r\n          get a better look at the black riding a horse.\r\n          Django looks back matching their stare.\r\n\r\n          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY\r\n          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.\r\n          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow\r\n          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,\r\n          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD\r\n          among his SHEEP.\r\n          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.\r\n          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and\r\n          begins tossing them about.\r\n          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.\r\n          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.\r\n\r\n          THEN ...\r\n          .DJANGO rides by.\r\n          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the\r\n          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.\r\n          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the\r\n          same village.\r\n          And they too see Django ... . WOW!\r\n          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,\r\n          or The Big House as everyone calls it.\r\n          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday\r\n          night nigger fights.\r\n          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie\r\n          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm\r\n          hands) come out to greet the caravan.\r\n          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the\r\n          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.\r\n          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a\r\n          huge dust cloud behind it.\r\n          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive\r\n          \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of\r\n          the Big House to greet her brother.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.\r\n          steps...\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.\r\n          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,\r\n          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out\r\n          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum\r\n          South. -\r\n          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in\r\n          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.\r\n          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,\r\n          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power\r\n          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.\r\n          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.\r\n          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.\r\n\r\n          THEN...\r\n          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.\r\n          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,\r\n          and for a moment don't know what to think.\r\n          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.\r\n          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,\r\n          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,\r\n          limp.\r\n          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees\r\n          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;\r\n\r\n                         CALVIN CANDIE\r\n          Hello Stephen my boy!\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's\r\n          this nigger up on that nag?\r\n\r\n                         CALVIN CANDIE\r\n          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my\r\n          shoe.

He goes\r\n          through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on\r\n          the floor by the hanging man.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          You leavin', that's what you can take\r\n          with you.\r\n          Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to\r\n          him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         I31\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Now you were quite the topic of conversation\r\n          for the last few hours.
