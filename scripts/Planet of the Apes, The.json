CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT\n\n\tStars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. \n\tThe Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger \n\tthan ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.\n\n\tA speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. \n\tNo spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-\n\ttosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR \n\tthe voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTRONAUT'S VOICE\n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\t\n\t\t\tSo ends my last signal until we reach\n\t\t\tour destination. We are now on automatic, \n\t\t\ta mere hundred and five light years from \n\t\t\tour base ... and at the mercy of com-\n\t\t\tputers. I've tucked in my crew for the \n\t\t\tlong sleep. I'll join them presently.\n\n2\tINT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT\n\n\tThe cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the \n\tPresident's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console \n\tof dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs \n\tis occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder \n\tamidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin\n\tis obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating\n \tfrom a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a\n \tmicrophone.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTRONAUT\n\t\t\tWithin the hour we shall complete\t\n\t\t\tthe sixth month of our flight from\n\t\t\tCape Kennedy. By our time, that is ...\n\n\tHe pauses, looking up at:\n\n3\tTWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL\n\n\tOne clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has \n\ttwenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.\n\n\tThe other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a\n \ttachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.\n\n\tThe largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.\n \tOver this we hear:\n\n\t\t\t\tASTRONAUT'S VOICE\n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\n\t\t\tBut according to Dr. Hasslein theory of \n\t\t\ttime in a vehicle traveling at close to \n\t\t\tthe speed of light, old Mother Earth has \n\t\t\taged a few thousand years since our de-\n\t\t\tparture -- while we have scarcely aged \n\t\t\tat all.\n\n4\tCLOSE ON ASTRONAUT\n\n\tThis is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and\n \tcomfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of \n\ta cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then\n \tcontinues:\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tIt may be so. This much is probable: the \n\t\t\tmen who sent us on this journey have long \n\t\t\tsince been moldering in forgotten graves; \n\t\t\tand those, if any, who read this message \n\t\t\tare a different breed. Hopefully, a \n\t\t\tbetter one.\n\n\tHe begins to roll up his left sleeve.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tI leave the twentieth century without \n\t\t\tregret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said \n\t\t\t'Modern man is the missin 'a link between \n\t\t\tthe ape and the human being.'\n\n\tHe removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one \n\tof the portholes into the astral night.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tOne final thought -- nothing scientific, \n\t\t\tpurely personal. Seen from up here, \n\t\t\teverything looks different ... Time bends \n\t\t\tand space is boundless. It squashes a \n\t\t\tman's ego. He begins to feel like no more \n\t\t\tthan a mote in the eye of eternity. And \n\t\t\the is nagged by a question: ahat if any-\n\t\t\tthing, will greet us on the end of man's \n\t\t\tfirst journey to a star? Are we to believe \n\t\t\tthat throughout these thousands of galaxies, \n\t\t\tthese millions of stars, only one, that \n\t\t\tspeck of solar dust we call Earth, has \n\t\t\tbeen graced -- or cursed -- by human life?\n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tI have to doubt it.\n\n\tHe extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects \n\tit into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(sardonically) \n\t\t\tThat's about all. I wonder if Man, that \n\t\t\tmarvel of the universe, that glorious \n\t\t\tparadox who has sent me to the unknown... \n\t\t\tstill makes war against his brother., and \n\t\t\tlets his neighbor's children starve.\n\n\tTaylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in \n\ta drawer of the console.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tWell then, Earthmen: A missing link \n\t\t\tsalutes you. Bless you, my descendants.\n\n\tTaylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the\n \thypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and \n\tlooks up again at:\n\n5\tTHE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME\n\n\tThe longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per \n\tsecond. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.\n\n6\tINT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tSpace scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, \n\tfor Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after \n\tsection without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now \n\tsee four glass capsules, or \"caskets\", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor \n\tlooks down at them.\n\n7-\tSEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n10\n\tOne of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE, \n\tLANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and \n\tLandon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart \n\tis a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed \n\tand they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make \n\tthem so alive.\n\n11\tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR\n\n\tHe grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into\n \tit. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid\n \tshut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies\n \tback, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.\n \tHis eyes are open. He seems serene, even enraptured.\n\n\t\t\n\t(NOTE: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to\n \tconvey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of\n \ttime.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n12-\tA SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)\n16\t\n\tWe see a strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a \n\tsmall area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and\n \tlooms larger, as if\" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of\n \tdescent.\n\n\tThe topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much\n \tof it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be\n \tcratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow\n \t\"green belts\" and a patch of blue water.\n\n\tIn the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it\n \twould be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand\n \tfeet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a \n\tvast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is \n\tblue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell\n \tlocation, at Lone Rock.)\n\n17\tINT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n\tFour empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in \n\tb.g. We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND \n\tas in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then, a \n\tgreat CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact.\n \tLoose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin\n \taisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four\n\tglass caskets. There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass \n\tdomes of the caskets swing open automatically.\n\n18\tCLOSE ON TAYLOR\n\n\tHe now has a full beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert, he \n\trises to a sitting position, gazing across at:\n\n19\tDODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThey, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor. They, too, are\n\tbearded.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\n\t\t\tYou all right?\n\n\tThey nod.\n\n20\tBACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT\n\n\tHe glances at the casket beside his own.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tStewart?\n\t\t\t\t(struggling to his feet) \n\t\t\tStewart?\n\n21\tCLOSE-SHOT --THE FOURTH CASKET\n\n\tIts dome remains unopened. The young woman is a skeleton in a \n\tChurchill suit.\n\n22\tREACTION SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS\n\n\tDodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull \n\tof their dead comrade. A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.\n \tSimultaneously the lights begin to FADE. A moment later they brighten,\n \tbut not as much as before.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tThere goes our primary power. We're on \n\t\t\tauxilliary.\n\n\tA slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:\n\n23\tREVERSE ANGLE - THE FORWARD CABIN\n\n\tA trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the\n \tcabin. Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.\n\n24\tLONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:\n\n\twater \n\n\tThe porthole is no more than six inches above the line. In the \n\tdistance we discern a shoreline of red desert.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\n\t\t\tWe're in the soup. We're sinking.\n\n25\tINT. CABIN - FULL SHOT\n\n\tThe leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. Taylor \n\tturns away from the porthole, calling:\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tDodge! Read the atmosphere!\n\n\tDodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and \n\tmounts it. Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward\n \tthe console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's\n\tskeleton.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tLandon! Send a last signal.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON\n\t\t\t\t(dazed) \n\t\t\tWhat signal?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tTo Earth! That we've landed!\n\n\tAs Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n26\tEXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE\n \tROCK, LAKE POWELL)\n\n\tWe are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.\n \tThere is no sign of vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body \n\tof water that could be the bay of an inland sea. The deep blue of the\n \tsea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. CAMERA HOLDS\n \ton the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred\n \tyards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and\n \tonly its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The\n \tred-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.\n\n\tSuddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is \n\tlocated amidships.\n\n27\tINT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH\n\n\tDodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges \n\tto the end of the snorkel tube. He reads the dials, removes the kit,\n \tsniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:\n\n\t\t\t\tDODGE \n\t\t\tIt's breathable.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tOkay! Blow the hatch before we lose \n\t\t\tauxilliary power.\n\n\tDodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.\n\n28\tCLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON\n\n\tThe spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing. \n\tThe LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While\n\tLandon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder\n \trolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON\n\t\t\tIt's no use ... there she goes.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tForget it. Abandon ship.\n\n29\tWIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN\n\n\tThe escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and\n \tpasses a folded life raft up to Dodge. When Landon reaches the ladder,\n \tTaylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs \n\tthrough the escape hatch. Taylor is about to follow with a third\n \trucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:\n\n30\tTHE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tBoth clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF \n\tTIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked \n\tEARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.\n\n31\tEXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT\n\n\tDodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and \n\ttosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and \n\tclimb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips \n\tinto the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to \n\tpaddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and \n\ttakes a sample of the water.\t\n\n32\tCLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT\n\n\t\t\t\tDODGE\n\t\t\t\t(half to himself) \n\t\t\tBriny...twenty-five percent salinity. \n\t\t\tNear the saturation point.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON\n\t\t\t\t(looking back)\n\t\t\tShe's still sinking...\n\n33\tTHE SPACESHIP - FROM THEIR P.O.V.\n\n\tOnly the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\n\t\t\tGoing ... going...\n\n \tThe craft vanishes beneath the water.\n\n34\tCLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT\n\n\tDodge is still busy with his kit. Landon is still looking back, but \n\tTaylor doesn't bother to turn his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON \n\t\t\tGone.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(flatly)\n\t\t\tWe're here to stay.\n\n35\tANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING WITH THE RAFT\n\n\tThey gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the\n \tshore.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDON  \n\t\t\tWell? Where are we? Have any notion, \n\t\t\tskipper?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(confidently) \n\t\t\tWe're some three hundred and twenty \n\t\t\tlight years from Earth.

I'll \n\t\t\tcheck the equipment.\n\n\tDodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill \n\tfrom his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins \n\tto take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents\n\tof the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around \n\this knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and \n\tsucceeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific \n\tinquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous \n\tand certainly more \"human,\" for he has many fears to control: while \n\tTaylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(calls Dodge) \n\t\t\tGot your sensors?\n\n\t\t\t\tDODGE \n\t\t\tYo!\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tGeiger counter?\n\n\t\t\t\tDODGE \n\t\t\tYo!\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(taking inventory) \n\t\t\tOne pistol... twenty-four rounds of \n\t\t\tammo. two medical kits.. one camera... \n\t\t\tone TX9.\n\t\t\t\t(loudly to the\n\t\t\t\tothers) \n\t\t\tWe've enough food and water for three \n\t\t\tdays.\n\n\t\t\t\tDODGE\n\t\t\tBut how long is a day?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tGood question.\n\t\t\t\t(turning) \n\t\t\tLandon -- check your communications \n\t\t\tkit.\n\n39\tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LANDON\n\n\tHe seems not to have heard.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(sharply)\n\t\t\tLandon!

A ROW OF CAGES - ANIMAL LABORATORY - TRACKING SHOT DAY\n\n\tThe cages are no larger than small jail cells. There are four of them. \n\tBars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible. Each \n\tof the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male. At the moment \n\tthe first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically. The \n\tthird occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored \n\thollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the \n\tfloor of his cage. He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to \n\treach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead. He has \n\tcorrectly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower \n\tunder the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its \n\tsmall base to support the broad-based fourth block.\n\n149-A\tCLOSE - TAYLOR\n\n\tTaylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the \n\tfourth cage. There is a clean bandage around his throat. He watches the \n\tblock-building primitive with contemptous amusement.\n\n\tBoth the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive \n\ttries to mount his tower. He stands there, staring dully at the \n\tscattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.\n\n149-B\tMED. - THE\tLABORATORY\n\t\n\tA door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named JULIUS enters, \n\tdressed in a keeper's uniform. He quickly closes the door, snatches up \n\ta broom, starts sweeping. Julius is obviously late for work. Taylor \n\tstruggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call \n\tout.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(soundlessly) \n\t\t\tHey! Hey!\n\n\tThe three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages. Julius \n\tbarks at them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\t\tSimmer down!\n\t\t\t\t(points at Taylor) \n\t\t\tYou especially.\n\n\tThe third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks. Julius comes up \n\tto Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its \n\tfloor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tBetter give it a try, stupid. Unless \n\t\t\tyou like going hungry.\n\n\tHe returns to his sweeping. Taylor glowers at him. A moment later, the \n\tdoor at the end of the aisle opens and Dr. Zira enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\t\tGood morning, Dr. Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tGood morning, Julius. How's our patient \n\t\t\ttoday?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tNo change. The minute you open the door, \n\t\t\the goes into his act.\n\n\tShe starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage. He grasps the bars, \n\tawaiting her anxiously. As she passes the second cage, the primitive in \n\tit shakes the bars, jumps up and down. His tongue is hanging out. Zira \n\tsmiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(playfully) \n\t\t\tWell, what do we want this morning? Do \n\t\t\twe want something? Speak! Come on, speak!\n\n\tThe primitive continues to jump up and down energetically. Zira takes a \n\tcube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tDo we want some sugar, old-timer?\n\n\tThe man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars. She drops the cube in \n\this hands. He jams it into his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\t\t(concerned) \n\t\t\tYou could get hurt doing that, Doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tDon't be silly. He's perfectly tame.\n\n\tShe moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tThey're all tame until they take a \n\t\t\tchunk out of you.\n\n150\tCLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR - ZIRA AND JULIUS\n\n\tTaylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tWell, Bright Eyes, is our throat\n\t\t\tfeeling better?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(frantic mouthing)\n\t\t\tListen, listen -- I can speak --\n\n\tHe winces, puts his hand to the bandage.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(sympathetically)\n\t\t\tAwww, it still hurts, doesn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tSee?

THE GROUP\n\n\tZaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor. He turns to Zira, \n\tgoes on in a more detached tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\tBut your behavioral studies are another matter entirely. To suggest \n\tthat we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is \n\tnonsense. Besides, men are a nuisance. They outgrow their own food \n\tsupply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our \n\tcrops. \n\t\t\t\t(looking casually \n\t\t\t\tat Taylor) \n\tThe sooner they're exterminated, the better.\n\n\tHe turns toward the door. A disappointed Zira follows him.

This \n\tcompound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is \n\tvisible in the distance.\n\n\tThere are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no \n\tmore than a third of them females. Some of them trudge around the dusty \n\tyard like convicts in a penitentiary. Others squat against the sun-\n\tdrenched wall.\n\n\tA big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it. Several \n\tguides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him. The \n\tprimitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' \n\tcircle.\n\n171\tCLOSER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING TAYLOR\n\n\tHe plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard, \n\toccasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound. Nova \n\tis at his heels. He ignores her. Once again he looks off, stops \n\tsuddenly. Nova bumps into him. He turns, impatiently shoos her away, \n\tthen looks o.s., again.\n\n172\tZIRA AND COMPANION - TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tZira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee, DR. CORNELIUS.

The guard \n\tmoves in, his club upraised.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(pleading)\n\t\t\tJulius, don't. It doesn't matter.\n\n\tJulius swings his-club at Taylor's head. Taylor lifts his right arm to \n\tward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand. He \n\tdrops the pen and notebook. The guard swings again, driving Taylor to \n\tthe wall. Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles.\n\n185\tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZIRA\n\n\tThe guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment:\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tNatural born thieves, aren't they?\n\n\tZira glances at the notebook. Her face clouds.\n\n186\tINSERT - WHAT SHE READS:\n\n\tA hasty, almost illegible scrawl:\n\n\t\tMY NAME IS TAYLOR.\n\n187\tCLOSEUP - ZIRA\n\n\tHer eyes afire with a wild surmise.\n\n188\tTWO SHOT - ZIRA AND JULIUS\n\n\tHer eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard:\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tGet me a collar and leash. I'm \n\t\t\ttaking him to the infirmary.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tHe's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's \n\t\t\tagainst the rules.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tDo as I say.\n\n\tThe guard shrugs and moves Off 0.3. Zira beckons to Taylor. He comes \n\tforward to the bars of the cage.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(sotto voce) \n\t\t\tYou wouldn't hurt me, would \n\t\t\tyou... Taylor?\n\n189\tINT. DR. CORNELIUS' OFFICE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY\n\n\tThe office is simple, almost Spartan. There are books but no bric-a-\n\tbrac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or \n\tother modern office equipment. Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling \n\tfuriously on a sheet of paper. His leash has been removed, but not his \n\tcollar. Zira stands at his elbow. Cornelius paces nervously up and \n\tdown, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(stubbornly)\n\t\t\tIt's a stunt. Humans don't write.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tDear, you're a scientist. Don't\n\t\t\tyou believe your own eyes?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(to Taylor)\n\t\t\tWhere did you learn to do this?\n\n190\tANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE\n\n\tTaylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, \n\thands it to Cornelius.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tJefferson Public School, Fort Wayne, \n\t\t\tIndiana?\n\n\tHe looks at Taylor narrowly. Taylor nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(sardonically) \n\t\t\tBack on that planet you say you came from? \n\t\t\t\t(Taylor nods again) \n\t\t\tUm-hm. \n\t\t\t\t(to Zira) \n\t\t\tHe may be intelligent, but he's also mad.\n\n\tTaylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at \n\tCornelius.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(reads aloud)\n\t\t\t'And you're a fool'.\n\n\tShe smiles. Cornelius bristles.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tNow, just a minute --\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tOh, Cornelius, be quiet.\n\n\tTaylor has resumed writing. He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads \n\taloud.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What \n\t\t\thappened to Landon?' \n\t\t\t\t(looking at Taylor) \n\t\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(scornfully) \n\t\t\tAnd they fell out of the sky with you?\n\n\tTaylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(reading)\n\t\t\t'Not fell -- flew!'\n\n\tTaylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tFlight is a scientific impossibility.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tAnd even if it weren't, why fly?\n\t\t\tWhere would it get you?\n\n\tTaylor points to the floor and mouths the word \"Here.\" He flings the \n\tpaper plane he has just fashioned into the air. It describes a graceful \n\tarc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly \n\tpicks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\t\tWell, now...\n\n\tTaylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(reading)\n\t\t\t'Do you have maps?'\n\n\tCornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map \n\tdesigned like a window shade. He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him \n\tat the map.\n\n191\tCLOSE ON MAP\n\n\tIt's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion \n\tknown to the apes. Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect \n\tof a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.\n\n\tA swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea. In the southwest \n\tquadrant are the \"greenbelts\" of the ape civilization, looking on the \n\tmap like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace. Rubyidots in \n\tthe lade indicate ape communities. The northwest quadrant, colored \n\tbrown, is apparently uninhabited. East of the green belts is a patch of \n\tgreen savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle. The eastern \n\tquadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to \n\tbe lifeless desert and barren mountain. This area is marked FORBIDDEN \n\tZONE.\n\n\tUsing a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the \n\tmiddle of the green belt.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tWe are here ...\n\t\t\t\t(moving pointer)\n\t\t\tYou were captured about here.\n\n\tTaylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern \n\tdesert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' \n\tlanding and trek.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(interpreting his \n\t\t\t\tmovements) \n\t\t\tYou fell in the water here? ... you came \n\t\t\tashore ... you marched across the desert ... \n\t\t\tthe mountains ... many days and nights ... \n\t\t\tand reached the jungle.\n\n\tTaylor nods, smiles gratefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(flatly)\n\t\t\tOut - of - the - question!.\n\n\tTaylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(annoyed) \n\t\t\tCornelius, why do you insist on \n\t\t\tprovoking him?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(tapping map) \n\t\tNo creature can survive in that part of \n\t\tthe Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've \n\t\tseen it.\n\n192\tWIDER ANGLE - THE THREESOME\n\n\tTaylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(reading)\n\t\t\t'Then how do you account for me?,\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tI don't.

In his trip to \n\t\t\tthe Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a \n\t\t\tculture older than recorded time -\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tThe evidence was very meager --\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tYou didn't think so then.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tThat was before Dr. Zaius and half the \n\t\t\tAcademy said the idea was heresy.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tHow can scientific truth be heresy? What \n\t\t\tif Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? \n\t\t\tA mutation. A missing link between the \n\t\t\tunevolved primate and the ape -\n\n\tTaylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word \"No!\" scribbles \n\tsomething on a piece of paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tHe's touchy, isn't he?\n\n\tTaylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t'I am not a missing link.'\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tBecause if he is a missing link, it means \n\t\t\tthe Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their \n\t\t\tparchment.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tWell, maybe they're not.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tNo, thank you'.

All turn.\n\n193\tREVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE DOOR\n\n\tDr. Zaius enters with another portly figure, DR. MAXIMUS. Like Zaius., \n\tMaximus is an orangutan.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(flustered)\n\t\t\tDr. Zaius --\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\t\t(not unkindly) \t\n\t\t\tDid you forget our appointment, \n\t\t\tCornelius?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tOh., no., sir.

It's a pleasure to see \n\t\t\tyou again.\n\n\tHe hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers. Maximus notes Taylor \n\twith distaste.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n\t\t\tWhat is that?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tA man, Dr. Maximus.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS \n\t\t\tI know it's a man. And you know the \n\t\t\trules. No animals outside the compound, \n\t\t\tand most certainly not without a leash.\n\n194\tANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE - FAVORING ZAIUS\n\n\tDuring the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office. He \n\tglances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them. \n\tMeanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tYes, Sir. But this -- creature\n\t\t\tis a special case.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n\t\t\tWhy special?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tWe're -- conducting a new experiment.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tWouldn't it more properly be done in \n\t\t\tyour office?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tYes, Sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS \n\t\t\t\t(calling)\n\t\t\tGuards?\n\n\tThe gorilla GUARDS enter from outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n\t\t\tReturn this beast to the compound.\n\n195\tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR\n\n\tHe regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him. One picks up \n\this leash. Over THE SHOT we hear:\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS' VOICE\n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tWhat's this?\n\n196\tREVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING ZAIUS\n\n\tZira stiffens, looking at Zaius. He is holding the paper plane\n\tfashioned by Taylor.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tA toy.

He \n\tsmiles tolerantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tNonsense.\n\n\tHe crumples the paper plane into a b all., drops it on the desk. The \n\tape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out. Zira \n\tfollows them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n197 \tINT. CAGES - ANIMAL COMPOUND - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n\tThe caged primitives are asleep. Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair \n\toutside Taylor's cage. CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying \n\ton his side, also asleep. Nova is curled up behind him. At the sound of \n\ta door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching \n\tTaylor's arm. He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to \n\thear:\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS' VOICE\n\t\t\t\t(o.s.)\n\t\t\tWhat's up, Lieutenant?\n\n198\tREVERSE ANGLE - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:\n\n\tTWO GORILLA OFFICERS have just entered the compound. They wear side \n\tarms. Julius has just risen from his  chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tAPE LIEUTENANT \n\t\t\tWe're taking Number Four over to surgery \n\t\t\tin five minutes. Have him ready.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\tHow come? The beast's throat is nearly \n\t\t\thealed.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT \n\t\t\t\t(snickering) \n\t\t\tIt's not his throat this time. The vet's \n\t\t\tgoing to geld him.\n\n199\tCLOSEUP - TAYLOR\n\n\tHe stiffens but does not move. The apes, of course, speak freely in \n\tfront of him, believing the animal cannot understand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS' VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tDr. Zira won't like it. She wants this \n\t\t\tpair to mate.\n\n200\tBACK TO THE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tAs the Lieutenant replies:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT \n\t\t\tThese orders came from Dr. Zaius himself. \n\t\t\tThere's nothing she can do about it.\n\n\tThe two gorillas exit. The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and \n\t'Leash.\n\n201\tCLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tPushing Nova aside, Taylor rises.\n\n202\tMED. SHOT - THE CAGE\n\n\tAs Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying \n\tthe collar and leash.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\t\t(murmuring) \n\t\t\tIf only you knew, Bright Eyes, what \n\t\t\tthey're going to do ... \n\t\t\t\t(raising collar) \n\t\t\tStand still now...don't give me any \n\t\t\ttrouble.\n\n\tThe heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly \n\tsnapping his neck. Julius falls unconscious. Taylor leans over him, \n\ttaking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.\n\n203\tREVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NOVA AND MALE IN ADJACENT CAGE\n\n\tThe male has awakened. He stares stupidly at Taylor. Nova is \n\twhimpering, little strange cries of fear. Taylor moves o.s.\n\n204\tANOTHER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tHe leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.\n\n205\tINT. A DARK CORRIDOR - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n\tBarefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.\n\n206\tCLOSE ON A DOOR\n\n\tWhich is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door\n \tof a guard room. We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER. Taylor \n\tfumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.\n\n207\tEXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - TAYLOR - DAY\n\n\tHe emerges, quietly locking the door behind him. Two tethered horses\n\tcan be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard \n\tfrom the nearby guard room. Taylor looks off.\n\n208\tLONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:\n\n\tAs already established, the animal compound is situated on the \n\toutskirts of the apes' community. The strange skyline of the town can \n\tbe seen in the distance.\n\n209\tPANNING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tHe starts to cross an open field outside the compound. At that moment \n\twe HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room. Taylor breaks into \n\ta run.\n\n210\tREVERSE ANGLE - THE COMPOUND\n\n\tAs the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward \n\ttheir horses.\n\n211\tEXT. A DIRT ROAD - LONG SHOT - TAYLOR\n\n\tHe runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a \n\tsmall lake, looking over his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQUICK DISSOLVE TO:\n\n212\tEXT. APETOWN - LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY\n\n\tThe community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane. \n\tThere are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as \n\tsuch, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall. The \n\tarchitecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and \n\tless rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or\n \texterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and \n\tsuggest an arboreal past.\n\n\tA small number of apes are visible on the mall:\n\n\tTaylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation. \n\tHe looks back at:\n\n213\tEXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG SHOT - MORNING\n\n\tThe two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping \n\tstraight toward CAMERA. It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.\n\n214\tBACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT\n\n\tHe retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the \n\tbuilding.\n\n215\tINT. A DARK VESTIBULE - MOVING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tThe vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which \n\tTaylor moves toward a shaft of light. We HEAR faintly the discordant \n\tchords of an organ. Or is it an organ? At any rate,a strange and \n\tmelancholy tune. Taylor arrives at a font.\n\n216\tINT. A TEMPLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tHe appears out of darkness into half-light. The rear of the temple is \n\tobscure. Taylor darts behind a screen. Crouching there, he observes:\n\n217\tA FUNERAL CEREMONY IN THE TEMPLE - MED. LONG SHOT\n\n\tThe temple itself is small and austere. There is no altar, but against \n\ta plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a \n\tbook. Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black \n\trobes. He stands in front of a closed coffin. A dozen mourners, seated \n\ton comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin. The \n\tape ladies wear cowls.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER \n\t\t\tWeep if you must, but make an end of \n\t\t\tsorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has \n\t\t\tfound peace in Heaven.\n\n218\tCLOSEUP - TAYLOR\n\n\tCrouching, listening, wide-eyed.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tHe was a model for us all, a gorilla to \n\t\t\tremember; hunter, warrior, defender of \n\t\t\tthe Faith.\n\n219\tBACK TO FUNERAL CEREMONY - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tAs the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself \n\t(as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the \n\taisle toward the rear of the temple.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER \n\t\t\tCherished husband, beloved father, \n\t\t\tgenerous master -- yes, he was a font \n\t\t\tof simian kindness.\n\n220 \tREVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING AT TAYLOR\n\n\tWho is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g. The small fry is \n\tcoming closer.

It's a man!\n\n\tThe mourners' heads turn. Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.\n\n221\tANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING THE MINISTER\n\n\tHe is aghast.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t\tIn Heaven's name ...\n\t\t\t\t(aside to ushers)\n\t\t\tGet rid of that creature.\n\n\tTwo ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.\n\n222\tEXT.

Darting off in another direction, he races past \n\tstartled pedestrians.\n\n225\tREACTION SHOT - TWO CHIMP PEDESTRIANS\n\n\tThey do a slow take.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIRST CHIMP\n\t\t\tYou see what I saw?\n\n\t\t\t\tSECOND CHIMP\n\t\t\tMust've escaped from the zoo.\n\n226\tMED.

AN AMPHITHEATER - LOW ANGLE SHOT (FROM GROUND LEVEL)\n\n\tIt is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the \n\tcentral mail. Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes.

AMPHITHEATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT (FROM TOPMOST TIER)\n\n\tTaylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp \n\tencircling the amphitheater. (A retaining wall shields him from the \n\tview of the apes.) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor \n\tcrouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:\n\n\tTHE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after \n\thim.\n\n235-\tOUT\n237\n\n238\tEXT. TOP OF AMPHITHEATER - PANNING WITH TAYLOR\n\n\tHe starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his \n\toriginal pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp. Reversing \n\tdirection, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes \n\tinto an exit tunnel. The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, \n\twho joins him in the chase.\n\n239-\tANOTHER PART OF THE MALL - A SWIFT SEQUENCE OF SHOTS\n244\n\n\tIn which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape \n\tshoppers and workers.\n\n245-\tEXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET - SEVERAL SHOTS\n248\n\n\tA market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors \n\tbehind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing \n\tapparel, etc. As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, \n\tseveral apes join the chase. In the ensuing pandemonium, like the \n\tproverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.\n\n249\tEXT. A BUILDING - CLOSE ON AN ARCHWAY\n\n\tTaylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his \n\tpursuers. Then he darts through the archway into the building.\n\n250\tINT. BUILDING - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - DAY\n\n\tFor the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing. His pace slows to a \n\twalk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian \n\tmuseum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive \n\tartifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc. Over \n\tthis we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.\n\n251\tFLASH SHOT - TAYLOR\n\n\tHe runs again.\n\n252\tMED. SHOT - AN APE MOTHER AND CHILD\n\n\tLooking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past. The mother gives a \n\tstartled SCREAM.\n\n253\tREACTION SHOT - A MUSEUM GUARD\n\n\tHe starts after the fugitive.\n\n254\tANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM - FEATURING TAYLOR\n\n\tHe runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts \n\tabruptly in close f.g., shocked by:\n\n255\tWHAT HE SEES: \tDODGE\n\n\tstuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.\n\n256\tCLOSEUP - TAYLOR\n\n\tReacting in horror. He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing \n\tFOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tDodge ...\n\n\tTaylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n257\tEXT. THE MALL - APETOWN - FULL SHOT FROM ON HIGH - DAY\n\n\tOrder has been restored in the open-air market. Taylor bursts suddenly \n\tinto view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic \n\tfrom ape guards in close pursuit. A mounted policeman spots him and \n\theads him off. Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another \n\tmounted Gorilla. And then a third.\n\n\tCAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall. We are witnessing \n\ta hideous game: \"baiting the man.\"  The mounted police do not shoot or \n\tclub Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long \n\twhips CRACKING over his head.\n\n258\tCLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE\n\n\twho unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor. This \n\ttime he bags his quarry. Taylor gives up. Spent, docile, entangled in \n\tthe net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall. Guards and \n\tcivillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay. They regard \n\thim warily.\n\n259\tCLOSE SHOT - DR. ZIRA\n\n\tShe pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his \n\tside.\n\n260\tCLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND ZIRA\n\n\tShe paws at the net, crying impulsively:\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tTaylor, why'd you run away?\n\n\tZira removes the net from his face. Panting with exhaustion, Taylor \n\tflicks a wild glance at her. He looks demented.\n\n261\tWIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TWO GORILLA OFFICERS\n\n\twho approach Taylor and Zira. (They are the same gorillas introduced in \n\tScene 198.) One of them carries a collar and leash. The other presents \n\tan I.D. card to Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT \n\t\t\tSecurity police.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(promptly)\n\t\t\tI'm in charge of this man. \n\n\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT \n\t\t\tNo longer, madame. He is now in the \n\t\t\tcustody of the Ministry of Science.\n\n\tHis colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle.\n\n262\tCLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR\n\n\tHe speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tGet away from me, you dirty ape!\n\n263\tFULL SHOT - THE SIMIANS AROUND TAYLOR\n\n\tThe arresting officer steps back involuntarily. All the apes freeze,\n\tstaring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN\n\n264\tINT. CAGES - CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - DAY\n\n\tThe compound is dimly lit. Taylor, the bandage now gone from his \n\tthroat, is back in his old cage. The other cages, however, are empty -- \n\ttheir occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo. \n\tHe is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled \n\ton his lap. Idly he strokes her coarse hair. There is a dull glow of \n\tmadness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like \n\ta man talking to a dog.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t...and that's when I decided to take \n\t\t\tup astronautical engineering., you see. I \n\t\t\twas halfway through college and I...\n\t\t\t\t(he breaks off) \n\t\t\tIt's an old trick! The silent treatment. \n\t\t\tFour weeks and three days, and not a word \n\t\t\tfrom anyone. Not Zira.,or Cornelius...or \n\t\t\tthat damn Julius. No one'll listen... \n\t\t\tonly you. You...Nova. NO-VAH.\n\n\tHis manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank \n\tcomprehension. She brushes his moving lips with her fingers. He shrugs \n\twryly.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tYeah...me Tarzan, you Jane. That's all \n\t\t\tright ... I had a puppy once that never \n\t\t\tbarked. He just licked my hand.\n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tHe's dead now. They're all dead. Everything... \n\t\t\tI think maybe they'll kill me, too. Are they \n\t\t\tafraid of me? I can't hurt them... but I \n\t\t\tthreaten them somehow. Threaten their faith \n\t\t\tin simian superiority. Yeah ... you're right. \n\t\t\tThey'll have to kill me.\n\n\tFaint footsteps are heard o.s. Taylor and Nova look in the direction of \n\tthe sound. A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes \n\tTaylor in the chest.\n\n265\tWIDER ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:\n\n\tAn ape GUARD has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor. It forces him \n\tback toward the rear of the cage. Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the \n\tcage, steps inside. He unlimbers the whip., cracks it-'in Nova's \n\tdirection. She recoils. The jet of water hold Taylor at bay. Julius \n\tgrabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage. Taylor \n\ttries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tLet her alone!\n\n\tJulius swings the whip. It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into\n\tthe skin. Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tWhere are you taking her? What are you \n\t\t\tgoing to do?\n\n\tJulius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking \n\tit behind him. Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings \t\n\thimself against the bars.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(raging) \n\t\t\tTake your hands off her, you black \n\t\t\tmonster! You filth!\n\n\tJulius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks \n\ther inside.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tWhy are you doing this? Say something,\n\t\t\tyou hairy scum!\n\n\tJulius gestures toward the ape guard\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\t\tTurn it off!\n\n\tThe ape guard shuts off the hose.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tAnswer me!\n\n\tJulius strides over to Taylor's cage.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS \n\t\t\t\t(fiercely) \n\t\t\tShut up! The reason no one'll talk to \n\t\t\tyou is because you're a freak!\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tWhere's Dr. Zira? Why--?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\t\tI said shut up!\n\n\tHe slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers. \n\tTaylor yells in pain. Julius and the ape guard start out of the \n\tcompound.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(wildly)\n\t\t\tApe! Apes wearing clothes!\n\t\t\tIt's a madhouse! A madhouse!\n\n\tHe sinks to the floor as the apes go out.\n\t\n266\tOUT\n\n267\tFULL SHOT - CAGE \n\n\tTaylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage. She \n\teyes him sadly.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(gently)\n\t\t\tNow I don't even have you.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tImagine me -- needing someone. Back on \n\t\t\tEarth there was nobody. Women, yes. \n\t\t\tLots of them. Love making  ithout love. \n\t\t\tThat's the kind of world it was turning \n\t\t\tinto, with the help of cynics like myself. \n\t\t\tSo I left it -- because there was no one \n\t\t\tdear enough to keep me there.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tDid I tell you about Stewart?\n\t\t\t\t(Looking away) \n\t\t\tThere was a lovely girl. The most precious \n\t\t\tcargo we brought along. If human life could \n\t\t\tsurvive here, she was to be the new Eve.\n\t\t\t\t(morosely) \n\t\t\tIt's probably just as well she didn't live \n\t\t\tto see this.\n\n\tHe looks at Nova. She stretches her hands through the bars toward him.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tI wonder if it's Love between us. \n\t\t\t\t(looks around, \n\t\t\t\tsmiles ironically) \n\t\t\tWhat a place to find it.\n\nC-267\tFULL SHOT - THE CAGE\n\n\tTwo gorilla officers enter, carrying torches. (These are the same apes \n\tintroduced in Scene 198.) One carries a double set of manacles. Julius \n\tcomes to meet them. The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from \n\tthe other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something. Julius \n\tcomes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage. He advances to \n\tTaylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around \n\teach of his ankles. Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his \n\twrists together, snaps on the cuffs.\n\nD-267\tWIDER ANGLE - THE CAGE\n\n\tTaylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss. Julius leads him out of \n\tthe cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands \n\tthe other end to the Lieutenant. Nova and Julius watch in silence as \n\tTaylor is led down the aisle and out the door.\n\n268-\tOUT\n272\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n273\tINT. INQUIRY ROOM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY\n\n\tTaylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise \n\tdeserted chamber. There is an empty chair on either side of him. Across \n\tthe room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs. There is a \n\tsmall table directly below the dais. A third table stands at right \n\tangles to the dais. Taylor looks around the empty room. A door is \n\topened by a gorilla BAILIFF, and Zira and Cornelius come into the room, \n\tsit down on each side of Taylor. A moment later, DR.HONORIUS, the \n\tProsecutor and a CLERK enter, take their seats at the third table.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\t\tWhere have you been? Why didn't you come \n\t\t\tto see me?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tShhhh!\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tWhat is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tA hearing.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(hissing)\n\t\t\tBe clever. Be quiet,\n\n\t\t\t\tBAILIFF\t\n\t\t\tAll rise!\n\n\tEveryone gets up as THE PRESIDENT, Dr. Zaius and Dr. Maximus enter and \n\tmount the dais.

He glances at his colleagues.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS \n\t\t\tYou asked for the opportunity to present \n\t\t\tyour case. Surely you must know why you're \n\t\t\there.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tMy own purpose is to save this exceptional \n\t\t\tcreature from mutilation.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n\t\t\t\t(promptly)\n\t\t\tAnd our purpose is to settle custodial and \n\t\t\tjurisdictional questions concerning this \n\t\t\tbeast, and determine what's to be done with \n\t\t\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tAt the very least, this man has the right \n\t\t\tto know whether there's a charge against \n\t\t\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\t\t(rising) \n\t\t\tObjection. The accused is indeed a man. \n\t\t\tTherefore, he has no rights under ape law.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\t\tWell, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?\n\n274\tCLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE\n\n\tSensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles \n\tconfidently.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tHe is unlike any man you have ever seen - \n\t\t\tas we hope to prove.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT'S VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tAnswer the question. Is he a man?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(tentatively) \t\n\t\t\tSir? The question is the point at issue: \n\t\t\tIs he a man? Or a deviate? Or a freak of \n\t\t\tnature?\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS' VOICE\n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tObjection!\n\n275\tFULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM\n\n\tAs the Prosecutor continues:\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT \n\t\t\tSustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, \n\t\t\tyou must admit the accused is a nonape, \n\t\t\tand therefore has no rights under ape law.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(rising)\t\n\t\t\tThen why is he called the accused Your \n\t\t\tHonors must think him guilty of something.\n\n\tHonorius seems confounded. Zaius takes over.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tThis man is not being tried. He is being \n\t\t\tdisposed of.\n\t\t\t\t(pointing at\n\t\t\t\tZira and Cornelius) \n\t\t\tIt is scientific heresy that is actually \n\t\t\ton trial here.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n\t\t\tWell put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn\n\t\t\tour friends that they endanger their\n\t\t\town careers by defending this animal.\n\n276\tCLOSE SHOT - THE DEFENSE\n\n\tBoth Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat. Sensing their \n\tpredicament, Taylor rises impatiently.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tThen I'll defend myself.\n\n277\tFULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM\n\n\tAlthough the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can \n\tspeak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice. \n\tFlustered, the President bangs his gavel.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\t\tDr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to \n\t\t\tsit down.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tMy name is Taylor.\n\n\tThe President refuses to address Taylor directly.

Make the animal be quiet.\n\n\tThe Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his \n\tchair.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT \n\t\t\tState your case, Mr. Prosecutor.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tLearned Judges: My case is simple. It is \n\t\t\tbased on our first Article of Faith: that \n\t\t\tthe Almighty created the ape in his own \n\t\t\timage; that He gave him a soul and a mind; \n\t\t\tthat He set him apart from the beasts of \n\t\t\tthe jungle, and made him the lord of the \n\t\t\tplanet.\n\n278\tCLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE\n\n\tTaylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. Zira and \n\tCornelius remain attentive to:\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS' VOICE \n\t\t\t\t(o.s.) \n\t\t\tThese sacred truths are self-evident. The \n\t\t\tproper study of apes is apes. But certain \n\t\t\tyoung cynics have chosen to study man - \n\t\t\tyes, perverted scientists who advance on \n\t\t\tinsidious theory called 'evolution.'\n\n279\tFULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM\n\n\tAs the Prosecutor continues:\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tThere is a conspiracy afoot to undermine \n\t\t\tthe very cornerstone of our Faith\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\t\tCome to the point, Dr. Honorius.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tDirectly, Mr. President. This wretched man, \n\t\t\tthe accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.\n\t\t\tWe know that he was wounded in the throat at \n\t\t\tthe time of his capture. The State charges \n\t\t\tthat Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named \n\t\t\tGalen experimented on this wounded animal, \n\t\t\ttampering with his brain and throat tissues \n\t\t\tto create a speaking monster ...\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(on her feet)\n\t\t\tThat\u00d5s a lie!\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\t\t\t(pounding gavel)\n\t\t\tMind your tongue, madame.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tDid we create his mind too? Not only \n\t\t\tcan this man speak. He can write. He can \n\t\t\treason.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS\n\t\tHe can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, \n\t\tlet me expose this hoax by direct examination.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\tProceed. But don't turn this hearing into a \n\t\tfarce.\n\n\tHonorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an \t\n\tevil smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tTell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is \n\t\t\tthe second Article of Faith?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tI admit, I know nothing of your culture.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tOf course he doesn't know our culture - \n\t\t\tbecause he cannot think.\n\t\t\t\t(to Taylor) \n\t\t\tTell us why all apes are created equal.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tSome apes, it seems, are more equal than \n\t\t\tothers.\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tRidiculous. That answer is a contradiction \n\t\t\tin terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men \n\t\t\thave no souls? What is the proof that a \n\t\t\tdivine spark exists in the simian brain?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(hands paper to Zira) \n\t\t\tShow this to the President.\n\n\tZira moves toward the dais. Honorius returns to his own table.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tSince the defendant is forbidden to speak \n\t\t\tin his own defense, he asks that this \n\t\t\tstatement be read into the record.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT \n\t\t\tRead it yourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\t\t(reading aloud) \n\t\t\t'I have come to you from a planet in a \n\t\t\tdifferent solar system.

Silence that man!\n\n\tReturning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tHow sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead \n\t\t\tmen, like sunken ships, can tell no \n\t\t\tstories.

My witnesses -- \t\n\t\t\tcorrection -- my exhibits are on display in \n\t\t\tthe amphitheater.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT \n\t\t\tVery well. I suggest we go and look at them.\n\n\tThe President rises, starts out, followed by the others. Taylor is \n\tlast, being led on a leash by the bailiff.\n\n280 \tOUT\n\n281\tEXT. AMPHITHEATER - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n\tThe inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater. Two APES \n\tstand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in \n\tthe center of the pit below the dais. There are three primitive males, \n\tthe female Nova -- and Landon. He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is \n\tcropped close.\n\n282\tCLOSE - TAYLOR\n\n\tHe turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(a whisper) \n\t\t\tIt's him...Landon.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tWhich one?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tSecond from the left.\n\n283\tFULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER\n\n\tZaius glances at the accused.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tWell...do you acknowledge kinship with \n\t\t\tany of these creatures?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tWith one of them.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tIdentify him, then.

There is still no response. \n\tTaylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face. There is \n\ta fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.\n\n286\tFULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER\n\n\tAs Taylor whirls on Zira.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tYou! ...

INQUIRY ROOM - MED. SHOT - DAY\n\n\tThe bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his \n\tchair. Moments later the other apes enter the room. All take their \n\tseats but Zaius. Taylor glares at him furiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(calmly) \n\t\t\tMr. President, a word of explanation: the \n\t\t\tcreature in question suffered a skull \n\t\t\tfracture during the hunt. Two fine \n\t\t\tveternary surgeons under my direction \n\t\t\twere able to save his life. But the beast \n\t\t\tcould not speak, of course. Nor will he\n\t\t\tever speak\n\n\tTaylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tYou destroyed his memory! His mind! His \n\t\t\tidentity!

Gag that\n\t\t\tmonstrosity!\n\n\tThe bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tYou barbarians!\n\n\tThe powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff \n\tlashes his wrists together. Then the bailiff gags Taylor. His voice is\n\tcut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.\n\tThe guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet. His tone is firm, but \n\tconciliatory.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tMay it please the Tribunal: I for one \n\t\t\tgrant that this being cannot have come \n\t\t\tfrom another planet. But this much is \n\t\t\tcertain -- he comes from somewhere in the\n\t\t\tForbidden Zone. He has described the region  \n\t\t\tto us, and described it accurately, for I \n\t\t\thave been there.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT \n\t\t\tYou visited the Forbidden Zone?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tWhy, yes, sir. A year ago. With the special \n\t\t\tpermission of the Academy.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(to President) \n\t\t\tHe exceeded his orders. His travel permit \n\t\t\twas promptly revoked.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tYes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But \n\t\t\tnot before I discovered evidence of a simian \n\t\t\tculture that existed long before the Sacred \n\t\t\tScrolls were written ...\n\n\t\t\t\tHONORIUS \n\t\t\tObjection!

ZAIUS - NIGHT\n\n\tThe office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in \n\tfact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used. There are \n\tmany thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading \n\tone of them and taking notes. He looks up as someone KNOCKS at the \n\tdoor.\n\n291\tREVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST ZAIUS\n\n\tThe two agents push Taylor through the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tWait outside.\n\n\tThe officers withdraw, closing the door. Collared, wrists manacled, \n\tTaylor stands facing the desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tThe verdict is in. At the moment your \n\t\t\tsimian friends -- and  sponsors -- are \n\t\t\tfree on bail. But they'll soon be brought \n\t\t\tto trial for heresy.\n\n292\tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZAIUS\n\n\twho falls silent, as if this were the only news of import. We note at \n\tonce a change In Zaius' tone and attitude. He no longer treats Taylor \n\tlike a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who \n\tmust be intimidated by the threat of terror.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tWhat about me?\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\t\t(offhandedly) \n\t\t\tOh, your case was preordained. In a way, \n\t\t\tyou performed a service for the State ...\n\t\t\t\t(smiling) \n\t\t\tBecause your hearing made it possible \n\t\t\tfor us to expose Zira and Cornelius.\n\t\t\t\t(a beat) \n\t\t\tAnd now the Tribunal has placed you in \n\t\t\tmy custody for...final disposition.

Ultimately, a \n\t\t\tkind of living death.\n\n\tTaylor stiffens but says nothing. Zaius lets this prospect sink in, \n\tthen continues.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tHowever, it's within my power to grant\n\t\t\tYou a reprieve.  That is why I summoned \n\t\t\tyou here tonight.\n\t\t\t\t(a beat) \n\t\t\tTell me who and what you really are and \n\t\t\twhere you come from, and no veterinary \n\t\t\twill touch you.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\t \n\t\t\tI told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tYou lied.

Why \n\t\t\tdoes the appearance of one mutant send \n\t\t\tyou into a panic?\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tBecause you're not unique.

Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across \n\tthe aisle. He sits on the pile of straw. There is an ugly welt on his \n\tcheek made by the security officer's whip. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Taylor \n\tand Nova look up and off.\n\n294\tREVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:\n\n\tA solemn, teen-age chimp named LUCIUS appears outside the cage.

The Anti-\n\t\t\tvivisectionist Society is up in arms. They're \n\t\t\tgoing to save this beast from those butchers \n\t\t\tin the lab.

It is dark here, so Julius crosses \n\tto a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. Lucius, \n\tbehind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or \n\tstrike the guard. Taylor is slow to understand. Lucius shakes his\n\thead impatiently.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS  \n\t\t\t\t(peering at document)\n\t\t\tThis order's no good. It must be counter-\n\t\t\tsigned by Dr. Zaius --\n\n\tLucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove.

Two naked \n\tprimitive males can be dimly seen within the cage. Four or five armed \n\tgorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the \n\tothers are passing a jug from hand to hand-.\n\n\tThe leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as \n\tthe lab wagon approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER \n\t\t\tHold it!\n\n\tLucius obeys.

I wish to create an \n\tillusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, \n\trefracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tPresent your evidence, Cornelius.\n\n\tCornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira. Taylor bends \n\tdown, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the \n\texcavation. Nova sits beside him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t\t(pointing) \n\t\t\tIt was at this level I discovered traces \n\t\t\tof an early ape creature -- stage of \n\t\t\tprimitive barbarism, really -- dating back \n\t\t\troughly thirteen hundred years. It was here \n\t\t\tI found cutting tools and arrowheads of \n\t\t\tquartz and the fossilized bones of \n\t\t\tcarnivorous gorillas.\n\n\tCAMERA (ON BOOM) MOVES IN SLOWLY as Cornelius continues:\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tBut the artifacts lying at your feet \n\t\t\twere found here, at this level. And \n\t\t\tthat's the paradox. The more ancient \n\t\t\tculture is the more advanced. Admittedly, \n\t\t\tmany of these objects are unidentified, \n\t\t\tbut clearly they were fashioned by beings \n\t\t\twith a knowledge of metallurgy.\n\n\tCAMERA KEEPS MOVING IN on the group in and around the excavation as \n\tCornelius continues:\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tIndeed, the very fact that these tools \n\t\t\tare unknown to us could suggest a culture \n\t\t\tin certain ways almost equal to our own. \n\t\t\tSome of the evidence is uncontestable ...\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\t\t(interrupting) \n\t\t\tDon't speak to me in absolutes. The \n\t\t\tevidence is contestable.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tI apologize.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tTo begin with, your methods of dating \n\t\t\tthe past are crude, to say the least. There \n\t\t\tare geologists on my staff who would laugh at \n\t\t\tyour speculations.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tPerhaps that's why they're on your staff.\n\n\tZaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the \n\tartifacts. He nudges them with his foot.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tSecondly, if these 'tools' as you call \n\t\t\tthem, are unidentified, why are they \n\t\t\tintroduced as 'evidence' of anything?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(promptly) \n\t\t\tBut there's the doll, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\t\tRight there. The human doll.\n\n\tZaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.\n\n359\tCLOSE ON DOLL - IN ZAIUS' HAND\n\n\tIt is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is \n\tunmistakably the form of a human child.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\t\n\t\t\tWhat does this prove? My grand-\n\t\t\tdaughter plays with human dolls.\n\n360\tFULL SHOT - THE EXCAVATION - INCLUDING TAYLOR\n\n\tExasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tTaylor! Tell him.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tHe has a point. On my planet children \n\t\t\toften play with ape dolls.\n\n\tZaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova. She picks it up, \n\tstudies it.\n\n361\tGROUP SHOT - THE THREE APES\n\n\tCornelius tries again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tA doll alone proves nothing. True. But \n\t\t\tthe doll was found beside the jawbone \n\t\t\tof a man -- and no trace of simian fossils \n\t\t\thas turned up in this deposit.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tYour conclusion is premature. Have you \n\t\t\tforgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth \n\t\t\tScroll?\n\t\t\t\t(quoting from memory) \n\t\t\t'And Proteus brought the upright beast \n\t\t\tinto the garden, and chained him to a tree, \n\t\t\tand the children made sport of him.'\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(impatiently)\n\t\t\tNo sir, I haven't forgotten.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tWell? For a time the ancients kept humans \n\t\t\tas household pets.\tUntil the Lawgiver \n\t\t\tproved that man could not be tamed. Keep \n\t\t\tdigging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of\n\t\t\tthe master of this house: an ape.\t\n\nA-361\tANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tAs Zira again appeals to the man.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tAre you going to let that pass without \n\t\t\tan answer?\n\n\tTaylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tYes. I have to agree. From all you've \n\t\t\tfound so far, his position's as good as \n\t\t\tyours.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing there?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tReconstructing a life. Care to have a \n\t\t\tlook?\n\n\tCornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the \n\texcavation.\n\nB-361\tMED. CLOSE SHOT - FAVORING TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tAs the apes come close. A number of artifacts have been arranged in \n\tfront of Taylor.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(to Cornelius) \n\t\t\tThese were found near the human doll, \n\t\t\tright?\n\t\t\t\t(Cornelius nods) \n\t\t\tWell, whoever owned them was in pretty \n\t\t\tbad shape.\n\n\tHe picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tDefective eyesight..\n\n\tAs Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by \n\tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tHe wore false teeth. \n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tHe suffered from a hernia and used \n\t\t\tthis truss to hold up his insides ...\n\t\t\t\t(pause)  \n\t\t\tAnd toward the end, these little rings \n\t\t\tof stainless steel enclosed a prefab-\n\t\t\tricated valve in his failing heart.\n\n\tTaylor pauses. Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tI don't say he was a man like an Earthman, \n\t\t\tbut I'd call him a close relative, for \n\t\t\the was plagued by most of man's ills. \n\t\t\t\t(to Zaius pointedly) \n\t\t\tYet, fragile as he was, he came before you \n\t\t\t-- and was superior to you.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(a calm smile) \n\t\t\tThat's lunacy. I can give an alternate \n\t\t\tdescription for everyone of those objects \n\t\t\tthat's equally as inventive as yours. But \n\t\t\tit would be conjecture, not proof.\n\n362\tWIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tShe is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll. From \n\tit comes a distorted SOUND.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOLL'S HEAD \n\t\t\tMamma! Mamma! Mamma!.\n\n\tThe apes stare at the doll in astonishment. Taylor snatches the doll \n\tfrom Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tDr. Zaius! Would an ape make a human \n\t\t\tdoll that talks?\n\n\tZaius looks at him, speechless. At that moment the CRACK of a distant \n\trifle shot reverberates through the cavern. All present freeze, \n\tlistening.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tLucius....\n\n363-\n364\tOUT\n\n365\tFULL SHOT - THE CAVERN - REVERSE ANGLE\n\n\tTaylor alone is armed. Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tYou louse!\n\n\tCornelius is already crossing the pit. He climbs out arid races toward \n\tthe mouth of the cave. Taylor runs after him. Zira and Nova hurry after \n\tTaylor.\n\n366\tMED. SHOT - ZAIUS\n\n\tExpressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth \n\tof the cave.\n\n367\tEXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE TO CAMP - ANGLING UP\n\n\tCornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward \n\tCAMERA. He halts in f.g., looking down at:\n\n368\tTHE CAMP SITE - AS SEEN FROM THE TRAIL\n\n\tTwo of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with\n\ttheir rifle butts. Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists' \n\thorses back beyond the trees.\n\n369\tEXT. THE TRAIL - AS SEEN FROM THE BEACH\n\n\tCornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high \n\tabove, descending the trail. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO DISCLOSE A GORILLA \n\tSNIPER in immediate f.g., crouching behind a boulder near the water. He \n\tsights his rifle at the man on the trail. Taylor is still too distant \n\tto make a sure target, and so the sniper waits.\n\n370\tCLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR ON THE TRAIL\n\n\tThis portion of the trail has no cover or concealment. Unaware of the \n\tsniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent.\n\n371\tLONG SHOT - TAYLOR - AS SEEN IN THE SNIPER'S SIGHTS\n\n\tThe gorilla fires.\n\n372\tCLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR\n\n\tThe bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head. Taylor \n\tscans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper. Nova comes to his \n\tside, pointing at:\n\n373\tTHE SNIPER - FROM THEIR P.O.V.\n\n\tHis head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece\t.\n\n374\tFLASH SHOT\n\n\tHe aims and fires.\n\n375\tFLASH SHOT - THE SNIPER\n\n\tTaylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder.\n\n376\tTHE TRAIL - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tTaylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is \n\tstanding. Outcroppings of rock offer some  cover here. Taylor pushes \n\tNova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit.\n\n377\tCLOSE GROUP SHOT - TAYLOR, NOVA AND ZIRA\n\n\tThe sniper's SECOND SHOT rings out. Instead of returning the fire, \n\tTaylor looks up the rail at:\n\n378\tZAIUS - FRO14 TAYLOR'S P.O.V.\n\n\tHe is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the \n\tmouth of the cave.\n\n379\tFLASH SHOT - TAYLOR\n\n\tBent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius. The sniper's \n\tTHIRD SHOT splatters rock fragments around him.\n\n380\tREVERSE ANGLE - THE TRAIL - ANGLING UP\n\n\tZaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some \n\tloose shale. No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor \n\tovertakes him. Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm. \n\tTaylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney. He spins \n\tZaius around, using him as a shield.\n\n381\tCLOSE TWO SHOT - ZAIUS AND TAYLOR\n\n\tTaylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed \n\tat his back.\n\n\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\tTell him to pull back!\n\n\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t(a hoarse cry)\n\t\tCease fire! Withdraw!\n\n\tHis command echoes from the west wall of the canyon.\n\n382\tLONG SHOT - THE FLOOR OF THE GORGE - FROM THEIR P.O.V.\n\n\tThe sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off \n\talong the beach.\n\n383\tBACK TO TAYLOR AND ZAIUS \n\n\tTaylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back\n\tof Zaius' head.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tI ought to kill you right now.\n\t\t\t\t(nudging him) \n\t\t\tLet's go.\n\n\tThey move off down the trail.\n\n384\tEXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - MED. SHOT - DAY\n\n\tZira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground. He \n\thas a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead. Nova and Cornelius come \n\tnext, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point. Lucius \n\tappears to be more humiliated than hurt.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS \n\t\t\tThey took me by surprise. Sneaked\n\t\t\tup on me while I was watering the\n\t\t\thorses. What's happened to honor?\n\t\t\t\t(pause, glum) \n\t\t\tI got off one round to warn you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(gloomingly)\n\t\t\tThey've taken everything.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\t\n\t\t\tNot everything. They left a hostage.\n\t\t\t\t(a pause)\n\t\t\tHow do you feel, Lucius?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS\n\t\t\tDisillusioned... \n\t\t\t\t(turning on)\n\t\t\tBut vindicated! I've been right all \n\t\t\talong. You can't trust the older \n\t\t\tgeneration. It's a matter of values --\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(gently)\n\t\t\tAll right, all right. Will You do me \n\t\t\ta favor? No orders.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS\n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tI want you to go around the bend and \n\t\t\ttell those gorillas their leader is my \n\t\t\tprisoner.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS\n\t\t\t\t(thoughtfull pause)\n\t\t\tYes, I can do that.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYL0R\n\t\t\tGood. Say I want a week's supply of food \n\t\t\tfor the woman and myself. A horse. A spade.\n\t\t\tAnd fifty rounds of ammunition.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS\n\t\t\tWhat if they won't agree to your terms?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tThen tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave \n\t\t\there alive.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\t\t(shocked) \n\t\t\tTaylor, you can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\t\t(Calmly)\n\t\t\tOh yes he can. He's a born killer.\n\t\t\t(to Lucius)\n\t\tDeliver the message.\n\n\tLucius looks to Taylor for confirmation. Taylor nods. The young ape \n\thurries away through the rocks. Taylor crosses to a useless saddle, \n\tpicks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tSit down. Over there.\n\n\tZaius squats on the ground beside the tree. Taylor sets his rifle \n\tagainst the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck.\n\tThen, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands \n\tbehind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the \n\ttree.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(as he works)\n\t\t\tNow, \tMinister of Science - let me explain \n\t\t\tcertain principle stress and strain. If \n\t\t\tyou exert pressure to remove these bonds, \n\t\t\tyou'll choke yourself to death. It'll be \n\t\t\tsuicide, you see?\n\n\tZira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin. Their rebellious \n\tspirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\t\n\t\t\tTaylor, please -- don't treat him that \n\t\t\tway.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tWhy not?\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA \n\t\t\tIt's humiliating.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tWasn't I humiliated? By all of you? \n\t\t\tDidn't you lead me around on a leash?\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\tThat was different. We thought you \n\t\t\twere .... inferior.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(wintry smile) \n\t\t\tAnd now you know the truth. \n\t\t\t\t(to Zaius) \n\t\t\tCornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He \n\t\t\tproved it. Man preceded you here. You \n\t\t\towe him your science, your language, \n\t\t\twhatever knowledge you have.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\t\tThen answer this: If ran was superior, \n\t\t\twhy didn't he survive?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(shrugging) \n\t\t\tHe might have been wiped out by a plague. \n\t\t\tNatural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm \n\t\t\tof meteors. From the looks of this part \n\t\t\tof your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA,\n\t\t\t\t(weakly)\n\t\t\tBut we can't be sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(indicating Zaius)\n\t\t\tHe is. He knew all the time. Long before \n\t\t\tyour discovery, he knew.\n\t\t\t\t(to Zaius) \n\t\t\tDefender of the Faith. Guardian of the \n\t\t\tterrible secret. Isn't that right, doctor?\n\n385-\n388 \tOUT\n\n389\tREVERSE ANGLE -\tCIRCLE - FAVORING ZAIUS\n\n\tAs Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tWhat I know of man was written long ago \n\t\t\t-- set down by the wisest ape of all --\n\t\t\tour Lawgiver.\n\t\t\t\t(to Cornelius)\n\t\t\tOpen my breast pocket.\n\n\tCornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black \n\tleather from the breast pocket of his tunic.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tRead it to him: the twentythird Scroll, \n\t\t\tninth Verse.\n\n\tCornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS \n\t\t\t'Beware the beast man, for he is the \n\t\t\tdevil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, \n\t\t\the kills for sport, or lust or greed. \n\t\t\tYes, he will murder his brother to possess \n\t\t\this brother's land. Let him not breed \n\t\t\tin great numbers, for he will make a desert \n\t\t\tof his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him \n\t\t\tback into his jungle lair: For he is the \n\t\t\tharbinger of death'.\n\n\tCornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\t\tI found nothing in the cave to alter that \n\t\t\tconception of man. And I still live by its \n\t\t\tinjunction.\n\nA-389\tANOTHER ANGLE - THE GROUP\n\n\tLucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse. Zaius' five \n\tmounted gorillas appear behind him. Taylor calls out to them:\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tStay where you \tare!\n\n\tLucius comes up with the horse. Taylor checks the provisions in the \n\tsaddlebags.

From the first, I've terrified you, \n\t\t\tDoctor. And in spite of every sign that \n\t\t\tI'm an intelligent being who means no \n\t\t\tharm, you continue to hate and fear me. \n\t\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(calmly, \n\t\t\t\twithout rancor) \n\t\t\tBecause you are a man. And you were right \n\t\t\t-- I have always known about man. From the \n\t\t\tevidence, I believe his wisdom must walk \n\t\t\thand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions \n\t\t\tmust rule his brain. He must be a warlike \n\t\t\tanimal who gives battle to everything around \n\t\t\thim -- even himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\tWhat evidence? No weapons were found in \n\t\t\tthe cave.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tThe Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. \n\t\t\tYour breed made a desert of it, ages ago.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR \n\t\t\t\t(he waits, \n\t\t\t\tthen wearily) \n\t\t\tWe're back at the beginning. I still don't \n\t\t\tknow the why. A planet where apes evolved \n\t\t\tfrom men. A world turned wrong side up.  \n\t\t\tA puzzle with one piece missing.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\t\tDon't look for it, Taylor. You may not \n\t\t\tlike what you find.\n\nB-389\tWIDER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND THE GROUP\n\n\tTaylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's \n\tflank. It canters off along the sandy shore.\tZira, Cornelius and \n\tLucius sadly watch the departure.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tUntie me!\n\n\tCornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck. Behind \n\tthem, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward. Zaius gets up, waves \n\tthem to a halt.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tNo, no! Let him go!\n\nC-389\tMOVING SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK\n\n\tTaylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows \n\this horse to a trot, smiles at Nova.\n\n390-\tOUT\n405\n\n406\tMED. SHOT - THE APES\n\n\tZaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach. \n\tThen he turns to an ape called MARCUS.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\t\t(quietly) \n\t\t\tFetch your explosives. We're going \n\t\t\tto seal the cave.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\n\n\tHe remounts his horse and rides o.s.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\t\t(aghast) \n\t\t\tSeal the cave?\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tThat's correct. And you will both stand \n\t\t\ttrial for heresy.\n\n\t\t\t\tZIRA\n\t\t\tBut the proof? The doll?\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS \n\t\t\tIn a few minutes there will be no doll. \n\t\t\tThere can't be. \n\t\t\t\t(honest regret) \n\t\t\tI'm sorry.\n\n\tCornelius throws himself at Zaius.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNELIUS\n\t\t\tYou mustn't! You gave your 'word!\n\n\tZaius looks emptily at one of his apes.\n\n \t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tWhat I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence \n\t\t\thim.\n\n\tA hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth. He is dragged off, \n\tstruggling, kicking. Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS \n\t\t\tDr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must \n\t\t\tknowledge stand still? What about the \n\t\t\tfuture?\n\n\tZaius looks benevolently at Julius.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tI may just have saved it for you.\n\n\tJulius and Zira look at each other, befuddled. Once more their eyes \n\tfollow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova. The beach separating \n\tthe water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIUS\n\t\t\tWhat will he find out there, doctor?\n\nA-406\tCLOSEUP - ZAIUS\n\n\tHis face is A mask, his tone enigmatic.\n\n\t\t\t\tZAIUS\n\t\t\tHis destiny.\n\nB-406\tWIDER ANGLE - TIE APES P.O.V.\n\n\tA moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend.\n\n407-\tOUT\n408\n\t\t\n409\tEXT. PALISADE AND BEACH - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY\n\n\tTaylor and Nova are already far downstream. There is a striking change \n\tin the terrain. The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be\n \tseen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened \n\tto form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea.\n\n\tA NOTE ON PRODUCTION: If feasible at new location site, this scene \n\tshould be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the \n\tcliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.\n\n410\tCLOSER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK\n\n\tHe is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation. Hearing \n\tthe CRIES of birds, he reins in and looks' up.\n\n411\tSKY SHOT - CIRCLING BIRDS\n\n\tSea gulls are soaring overhead.\n\n412\tTWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK\n\n\tHis expression is expectant, searching. Nova emits a whimper of \n\tanticipation, pointing off.\n\n413\tLONG SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:\n\n\tA verdant forest atop a distant palisade. Their view of the beach below\n\tthe forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance.\n\n414\tCLOSE SHOT - NOVA AND TAYLOR\n\n\tHe smiles at her hopefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\tYes, Nova -- I see it.\n\t\t\t\t(looks again at\n\t\t\t\tforest)\n\t\t\tIn my old profession green meant\n\t\t\tsafe. Green meant go.\n\n\tThe horse moves off at a trot, CAMERA PANNING. But they have gone only \n\ta short distance when they hear the distant THUNDER of an EXPLOSION. \n\tTaylor reins in and looks back.\n\n415\tVERY LONG SHOT - A CLOUD OF SMOKE\n\n\tA column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream.\n\n416\tBACK TO TAYLOR AND NOVA\n\n\tFrowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then \n\tdecides this is no time to linger. He digs his heels into the horse's\n\tflanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that \n\tsplits the beach. They are nearing the promontory that blocks their \n\tview of the beach beyond.\n\n417-\tOUT\n418\n\n419\tCLOSER ANGLE - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA.\n\n\tAs they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes \n\tinto view. it appears to be jutting from the sea.\n\n420\tREACTION SHOT - TAYLOR\n\n\tHe reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees. Then he rides on.\n\n421\tTHE STRANGE FORMATION - AS SEEN BY TAYLOR\n\n\tAn immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle. We can \n\tnow see that it is not rock, but metal. Green metallic tints show \n\tthrough its gray salt-stained surface. As we draw closer, the object \n\ttakes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand\n\tholding a torch.\n\n422\tREVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR\n\n\tFrowning with consternation. His horse proceeds at a slow walk.\n\n423\tTRACKING WITH TAYLOR - WHAT HE SEES:\n\n\tNear the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row \n\tof metal spikes. From this angle they look like tank traps.\n\nA-423\tCLOSER - TAYLOR\n\n\tDumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the  spikes. Nova \n\tdismounts and follows him.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAYLOR\n\t\t\t\t(a cry of agony)\n\t\t\tMy God!\n\n\tHe falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands. CAMERA SLOWLY \n\tDRAWS BACK AND UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT disclosing what Taylor has \n\tfound. Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of \n\tLiberty.\n\n424-\tOUT\n451\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanet of the Apes, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Wilson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:03.908622"}
