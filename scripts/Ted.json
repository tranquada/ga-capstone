Ted\r\n          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing\r\n          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap\r\n          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few\r\n          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted\r\n          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,\r\n          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in\r\n          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering\r\n          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles\r\n          into the back seat.

The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.\r\n          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the\r\n          back window.

With Donny closing in, Ted\r\n          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto\r\n          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's\r\n          a long drop.
