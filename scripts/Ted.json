It's\r\n          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one\r\n          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear\r\n          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.\r\n                         \r\n           NARRATOR (V.O.)\r\n           It has been said that magic vanished from\r\n           our world a long time ago.

John'S POV - We see the other kids all\r\n          playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing\r\n          snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A\r\n          WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with\r\n          open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.\r\n                         \r\n           NARRATOR (V.O.)\r\n           Well, as it does every year, Christmas\r\n           morning finally came.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          3\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n           NARRATOR (V.O.)

Ted sits on the sofa, and for\r\n          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is\r\n          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple\r\n          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's\r\n          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's\r\n          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits\r\n          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.\r\n          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-\r\n          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a\r\n          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,\r\n          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the\r\n          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity\r\n          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,\r\n          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that\r\n          this is a guy who has never really given up his\r\n          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear.

John thrusts his butt back in one move,\r\n          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force\r\n          to send her sprawling on the floor.

Eventually, he stumbles\r\n          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,\r\n          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.\r\n          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted\r\n          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted\r\n          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John\r\n          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,\r\n          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.\r\n          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be\r\n          pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n           AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ!\r\n           god fucking dammit!!!\r\n          Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and\r\n          the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,\r\n          each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).\r\n          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling\r\n          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the\r\n          process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in\r\n          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a\r\n          number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back\r\n          onto the bed. Ted taunts him.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           C'mon, motherfucker!\r\n                         \r\n          John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted\r\n          dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the\r\n          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about\r\n          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,\r\n          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the\r\n          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted\r\n          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles\r\n          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing\r\n          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,\r\n          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out\r\n          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord\r\n          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from\r\n          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and\r\n          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,\r\n          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the\r\n          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,\r\n          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He\r\n          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the\r\n          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,\r\n          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his\r\n          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks\r\n          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,\r\n          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          94\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n          The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a\r\n          crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV\r\n          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.\r\n          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over\r\n          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing\r\n          deteriorates into sobs.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED (CONT'D)\r\n                          (BREATHING HEAVILY)\r\n           Why...why are you crying?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n           My dick is in the TV.\r\n                         \r\n          John continues to sob.

Donny smacks Ted\r\n          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,\r\n          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in\r\n          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering\r\n          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles\r\n          into the back seat.

The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.\r\n          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the\r\n          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of\r\n          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles\r\n          for a bit, then drops to the ground.

ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles\r\n          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase\r\n          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door\r\n          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and\r\n          disappears inside.\r\n          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind\r\n          Donny's car.

Ted stops at a red\r\n          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs\r\n          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his\r\n          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him\r\n          down a bit.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through\r\n          the garage door, and running inside.

Donny emerges from\r\n          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints\r\n          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He\r\n          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted\r\n          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto\r\n          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's\r\n          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't\r\n          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,\r\n          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.\r\n          Ted climbs farther up the tower.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.
