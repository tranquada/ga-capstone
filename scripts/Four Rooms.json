She \n               kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, \n               and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on \n               the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on \n               pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from \n               the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone \n               to materialize into the garments.\n\n<b>                                     ATHENA\n</b>                         We need fresh rosemary from the \n                         kitchen.

But, as \n               she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing \n               connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning \n               with dizziness.

Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted \"ick\" \n               sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this \n               side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously \n               looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted \n               Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an \n               impatient and stern Athena.\n\n               Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.\n\n<b>                                     ELSPETH\n</b>                         We'll talk about this later, Kiva.\n\n<b>                                     KIVA\n</b>                              (angrily)\n                         No!\n\n               She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand.

Music begins, and slowly \n               they start to unfold from the rock.\n\n               The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the \n               Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of \n               clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.\n\n               They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the \n               semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is \n               Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself \n               between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a \n               bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.\n\n<b>                                     ATHENA\n</b>                         On this night, in this hour, we Call \n                         upon the Ancient Power O Goddess \n                         bride, I offer thee Milk from a \n                         mother's sweet titty!\n\n               Each of the girls moans eerily.

Jezebel places her \n               offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. \n               Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She \n               unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.\n\n<b>                                     RAVEN\n</b>                         Diana, oh great one, we live without \n                         sun Until this wicked curse is undone. \n                         In hope that you live, and to us \n                         appear, I have collected a year's \n                         worth of tears.\n\n               She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's \n               Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the \n               altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting \n               for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she \n               goes.\n\n               Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle \n               with a chain on its cap and neck.

Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really \n               getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. \n               He doubles back on the floors.

He manages to get his head and one arm \n               through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in \n               the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-\n               bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the \n               apartment.\n\n<b>                                     SIGFRIED (O.S.)\n</b>                              (shouting in the \n                              distance)\n                         It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, \n                         I'm fucking dying here!\n\n<b>               EXT.

He can see the flickering red glowing light from the \n               witches' room from the floor below.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Probably \n               everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody \n               hand print. It's not his blood.\n\n<b>               EXT.

PENTHOUSE--NIGHT\n</b>\n               The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the \n               house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the \n               hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the \n               Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this \n               moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a \n               new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of \n               the stone. And the look on his face says, \"King's good.\" \n               Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once \n               upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, \n               at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as \n               Ted.\n\n               One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair \n               with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in \n               his hand.\n\n               The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back \n               and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to \n               the rest of the room's activity.\n\n               In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, \n               which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the \n               room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers, \n               and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.\n\n<b>                                     CHESTER\n</b>                              (still sitting)\n                         Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.\n\n<b>                                     TED\n</b>                              (wheeling in the tray)\n                         Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got \n                         everything you asked for --\n\n<b>                                     CHESTER\n</b>                         -- Not a problem, my friend Mr. \n                         Bellboy.\n\n<b>                                     ANGELA\n</b>                              (closing the door)\n                         His name's Theodore.\n\n<b>                                     TED\n</b>                         Actually, it's not Theodore,\n                              (he throws a look at \n                              Angela)\n                         It's Ted.\n\n               Chester rises from the couch.\n\n<b>                                     CHESTER\n</b>                         So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying -- \n                         would you care for some champagne? \n                         That's not what I was saying, but \n                         would you care for some champagne?\n\n<b>                                     TED\n</b>                         No, thank you.\n\n<b>                                     CHESTER\n</b>                         Ya sure?

The look on her face combines strange \n               awe and mild shock.\n\n               Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell, \n               wearing Diana's see-through negligee and slippers, armed \n               with Elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward \n               her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.\n\n<b>                                     ANGELA\n</b>                         You okay, lady?\n\n               The bombshell looks up at her dizzily.\n\n<b>                                     ANGELA\n</b>                         I said -- you looking for someone?\n\n<b>                                     DIANA\n</b>                              (disoriented)\n                         Uhhh... yes... my husband...
