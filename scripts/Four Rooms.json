THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK\n\n               Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a \n               taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is \n               a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to \n               see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess). \n               She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and \n               is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.\n\n               Ted takes Athena's luggage onto his cart. But one item in a \n               woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is \n               concerned as he attempts to lift it.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Pleeze be careful -- my God.

Athena tips the cab driver, stingily. \n               The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed \n               with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put \n               this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at \n               Ted, who is out of breath.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         I'm usually a good tipper, but this \n                         one -- this cab driver -- he had \n                         green all around him.

Ted appears to be \n               charmingly oblivious.\n\n               Athena looks back into his face.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         ...you're okay.\n\n               Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the \"purple\" in \n               it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his \n               crotch and giving her a confused side glance.\n\n               INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK\n\n               Ted shifts hats to check the girl in. He checks her \n               reservation.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Athena Z.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (scratching his head --\n                              weird name, okay)\n                         You're booked in the Honeymoon Suite --\n                         just one night?

ELEVATOR--DUSK\n\n               The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor. \n               Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her \n               room.\n\n               AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR\n\n               Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In \n               the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids \n               poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms \n               beyond the still hot tub.\n\n               Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in \n               front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of \n               a little Cupid and mumbles, \"Perfect.\"\n\n               Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, \n               she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance \n               wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Well -- the other bag -- I need it.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Right.\n\n               He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He \n               laughs sickly.\n\n                                     TED\n                         What the hell you got in here, lady? \n                         Nuclear weapons?\n\n               She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the \n               bag.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                              (dryly)\n                         The White Cliffs of Dover.\n\n               Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and \n               pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it \n               to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         The others will be coming soon. Send \n                         them, pleeze.\n\n               Ted nods, confused by \"the others,\" and walks off with the \n               cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Oh -- I forgot to show you how to \n                         turn on the Jacuzzi.\n\n               But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water \n               begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         I been in dis' place many New Year's. \n                         So... you send the others to me, \n                         huh. Go now.\n\n               As she says this, the door closes with a strange force, \n               shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the \n               suite.\n\n               IN THE SUITE BEDROOM\n\n               A round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible \n               to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were \n               achieved by laughing.\n\n               Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of \n               stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it \n               like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the \n               head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.\n\n               Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching \n               high-heeled slippers.\n\n               And these she places with reverence on the bed.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         On this night, oh great goddess Diana, \n                         we restore your virgin flesh and \n                         bring you back to real life.\n\n               CLOSE ON the rock slab.

Well, it's a swimming \n                         pool, but it will be under the setting \n                         sun, okay?\n\n               INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS\n\n               Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first \n               guest, Elspeth arrives.\n\n               She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue \n               eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like \n               Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and \n               a silver sword on her shoulder.\n\n                                     TED\n                         May I help you?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         I... we... have a reservation.\n\n               Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Kiva!\n\n               ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a \n               long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling \n               \"PUSSY\" across her breasts. This is Kiva.\n\n               Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette \n               machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several \n               packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Wait up, gawd!

He fumbles for the key. He \n               walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile \n               luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth \n               turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva \n               lights up.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         What'd I tell you about smoking?\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         You smoke.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         That's right -- I smoke, and I'm \n                         addicted to it, and I don't want the \n                         same thing to happen to you.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                              (in game-show host \n                              voice)\n                         \"Hello -- welcome to this week's \n                         edition of the Hypocrite of the Year \n                         Award --\"\n\n               As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, \n               Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with \n               an unruly child.

He jumps back with a light nervous \n               laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.\n\n               AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR\n\n               The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee \n               tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room. \n               Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the \n               hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With \n               most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers \n               are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.\n\n               But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the \n               Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white \n               powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands \n               him a tip as he gawks at the circle.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Flea powder. One of the others is \n                         bringing her cat.\n\n               Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look \n               to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor. \n               He shakes his head and leaves.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You're gonna have to wait in the \n                         other room.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Why?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Because I said so.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         I'll watch TV.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You can't watch TV because the noise \n                         will interfere with our ritual.\n\n               Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway. \n               She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Okay... Mommy.\n\n               Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. \n               Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, \n               whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing \n               the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.\n\n               Kiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway \n               into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the \n               honeymoon bedroom.\n\n               Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with \n               the \"cleansed\" artifact and lays the slab in the center of \n               the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her \n               sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with \n               tender affection.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Soon -- our goddess will come. I \n                         will go get her negligee.\n\n               Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! \n               Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat \n               is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes \n               the negligee off the irrepressible youth.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         What are you doing!

Deal with dis \n                         girl!\n\n               Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and \n               respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                              (eyes lifted to heaven, \n                              wearily)\n                         Tell me -- did we have these problems \n                         in Salem? I don't think so...\n\n               IN THE BEDROOM\n\n               Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a \n               soft touch.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Kiva... you know what I love about \n                         you?\n\n               Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Your sweet side.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         And what do I get if I'm sweet?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You get whatever you want. And you \n                         know what else I love about you?\n\n                                     KIVA\n                              (seduced now)\n                         What?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Your nose.\n\n               And saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room. \n               Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she \n               has the last word.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         And I saw you checking her out.\n\n               Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.\n\n               IN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK\n\n               The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer \n               luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous \n               Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over \n               her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the \n               hall like a Southern princess.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                              (talking to her cat \n                              in baby talk)\n                         Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet \n                         little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the \n                         baby.\n\n               AT THE DOOR\n\n               Jezebel bursts in, chattering.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Well, this is just darlin'! Just \n                         darlin' Hi-dee, girls...\n\n               Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place \n               has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of \n               exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at \n               work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She \n               stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, \n               which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents \n               her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her \n               breasts and sucks in the vibes: \"Ahhhh.\"\n\n               Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, \n               but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks \n               it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it \n               sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Toodle-loo.\n\n               And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors \n               to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing \n               on herself.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a \n                         new lil' fool -- what the hell is \n                         she doin' here on our night of annual \n                         ritual?\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                              (wearily)\n                         I have sanctioned her presence, as \n                         long as she behaves.

Jezebel acts blithely innocent.\n\n               IN THE HALLWAY\n\n               Ted is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched \n               in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his \n               hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.\n\n               Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female \n               intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native \n               American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.\n\n               But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down \n               the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself.\n\n                                     RAVEN\n                         I'm looking for the room for making \n                         love.\n\n                                     TED\n                         You might be referring to the \n                         Honeymoon Suite.

We do need a few things.\n\n               Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She \n               kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, \n               and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on \n               the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on \n               pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from \n               the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone \n               to materialize into the garments.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         We need fresh rosemary from the \n                         kitchen. Mostly what we need is from \n                         the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?\n\n               Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Yeah, yeah, rosemary.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher \n                         salt if you don't got no sea salt.

He looks at \n               this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He \n               turns, points at Eva.\n\n               Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as \n               she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing \n               connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning \n               with dizziness. Athena smirks.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Get to work, man.\n\n               Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs \n               off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their \n               most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or \n               vials.\n\n               Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction \n               of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi, \n               with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Kiva...\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         What?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You have to go in the next room now.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I \n                         can't watch.\n                              (whining at Elspeth)\n                         I'm bored!\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         UP!\n\n               She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her \n               feet.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Don't put me in there by myself. \n                         I'll miss you way too much.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Kiva, don't do this to me.\n\n               Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of \n               the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         Please... if you just lemme... I'll \n                         play dress-up with you, the way you \n                         like it... you know what I mean... \n                         remember...?\n\n               Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up. \n               Kiva pours on softer seduction.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         We can pretend and I'll do it \n                         exactly... the way you want it... \n                         with the egg whites and the kilt.\n\n               Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and \n               presses it lightly on her face.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You mean... like last week?\n\n               Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted \"ick\" \n               sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this \n               side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously \n               looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted \n               Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an \n               impatient and stern Athena.\n\n               Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         We'll talk about this later, Kiva.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                              (angrily)\n                         No!\n\n               She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her \n               arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Aw, really now -- child abuse?\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         You stay outta this!\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         I demand this stop now, Elspeth!\n\n               Elspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her.\n\n                                     KIVA\n                         I'm running away from you!\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your \n                         parole officer and she'll find you \n                         and send you back to Eastlake!\n\n               Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Now that the fucking melodrama is \n                         over, can we start the goddamn ritual --\n                         pleeze?\n\n               Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her \n               shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         We are communing here on New Year's \n                         Eve to bring to life the great goddess \n                         Diana, who was turned to stone in \n                         this very room forty years ago today.\n\n               The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to \n               sway within the circle.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Diana, great beautiful one, we make \n                         these offerings to you, that we may \n                         undo the wicked spell which deprived \n                         you of the seed of your lover, your \n                         virginal blood, of your very life. \n                         We now form the symbolic rock with \n                         our bodies.\n\n               And saying this, the girls all form a \"rock\" with their bodies \n               gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly \n               they start to unfold from the rock.\n\n               The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the \n               Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of \n               clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.\n\n               They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the \n               semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is \n               Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself \n               between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a \n               bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         On this night, in this hour, we Call \n                         upon the Ancient Power O Goddess \n                         bride, I offer thee Milk from a \n                         mother's sweet titty!\n\n               Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on \n               the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now \n               steps forward with her offering in a vial.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         To reverse the evil which has been \n                         done I make this offering to the \n                         Divine One A whore not, an innocent \n                         was, For whom I seized a virgin's \n                         blood.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust, \n                         To undo this awful spell is a real \n                         must. To bring you life and get you \n                         high I offer the sweat of five men's \n                         thighs.\n\n               The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her \n               offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. \n               Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She \n               unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.\n\n                                     RAVEN\n                         Diana, oh great one, we live without \n                         sun Until this wicked curse is undone. \n                         In hope that you live, and to us \n                         appear, I have collected a year's \n                         worth of tears.\n\n               She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's \n               Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the \n               altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting \n               for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she \n               goes.\n\n               Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle \n               with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to \n               incant.\n\n                                     EVA\n                         Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will, \n                         I was to bring fresh sperm from my \n                         Bill.

You have one hour to \n                         prove what kind of witch you really \n                         are.\n\n               Just then: a knock at the door.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                              (calling out)\n                         What do you want?!\n\n                                     TED\n                         Ted... the bellboy.\n\n               Athena smiles and turns to Eva.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                         Mr. Bellboy, come right in!\n\n               Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the \n               fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all \n               except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.\n\n               Amazingly, Ted's attention is captivated by Eva's sorrow, \n               not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers \n               her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks \n               away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart. \n               Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels \n               in the cart.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Here's the things you asked for.

Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes \n               into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window. \n               She smirks at him comtemptuously.\n\n                                     ATHENA\n                              (handing Ted 50 bucks)\n                         Okay, mister, here's your fifty-dollar \n                         tip, only, you have to do one more \n                         thing... make our little Eva smile. \n                         Can you?

Athena turns to Eva and points to her \n               watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The \n               door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He \n               covers her with a shawl.\n\n               IN THE HALLWAY\n\n               The other witches listen at the door.\n\n                                     ELSPETH\n                         If she doesn't get his goop in ten \n                         minutes, I'm going to take him myself.\n\n                                     JEZEBEL\n                         Ha!

HONEYMOON SUITE--NIGHT\n\n               Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in \n               front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile. \n               But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Help me out, lady.

He \n               pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something \n               like \"Room 404.\"\n\n               Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown \n               and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark \n               room.\n\n               INT.

At the other end of the gun stands \n               a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile \n               and a \"just try fuckin' with me\" look on his face. Sigfried \n               isn't the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits \n               a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair. \n               Ted drops the bucket to the floor.\n\n                                     TED\n                         I brought your ice.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         That's cute.

Angela \n               implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation: \n               His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the \n               fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted \n               paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to \n               get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what \n               appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point \n               and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth.

You \n                         don't mind me calling you Teddy, do \n                         you?\n\n                                     TED\n                         That's fine.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         I used to have a little bunny rabbit \n                         named Teddy, it looked real cute \n                         nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem \n                         here is you're no bunny rabbit, \n                         Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes \n                         me to picture you doin' it. But don't \n                         let me stop you, Teddy... no need to \n                         play sneaky-poo.\n\n               Ted starts to back toward the door.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Look, man, if this is some kind of \n                         Voodoo thing and you want me to have \n                         sex with your wife, there is \n                         absolutely no way.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                              (shouts at the top of \n                              his lungs)\n                         I said, nibble, asshole! Now!\n\n               The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND \n               of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. \n               Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy \n               makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he \n               closes in, Angela's eyes close.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (whispers)\n                         Sorry, lady.\n\n               Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         What's the matter, no whiz left in \n                         the cheese? I'm not cramping your \n                         style, am I?\n\n                                     TED\n                         Look, I'm not playing this game \n                         anymore.\n\n               Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         It's almost all over, Theodore, and \n                         soon you can go home to Mommy.\n\n               Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear \n               hug and blasts out the following monologue.\n\n                                     TED\n                         My name is not Theodore, it's TED, \n                         TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT \n                         TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes, \n                         my mother did me the service of naming \n                         me Theodore and I haven't a clue as \n                         to how you know that because everyone \n                         who knows that lives a long way away \n                         from here. Do you have any idea what \n                         it's like to go to school where all \n                         the other kids' parents are in jail \n                         doing time for crimes like grand \n                         larceny, aggravated assault, burglary \n                         and murder, and you get stuck with a \n                         mother who names you Theodore and \n                         dressed you up in little matching \n                         pink outfits with, get this, a little \n                         blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll \n                         tell you what happens. Pretty soon \n                         Theodore becomes \"Theo the Thumper,\" \n                         and when Theo the Thumper gets old \n                         enough, he packs his bags and goes \n                         thousands of miles away where he can \n                         put the whole bloody mess behind \n                         him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me \n                         now, because no one is going to call \n                         me that again. My name is Ted, okay? \n                         Got it? TED!\n\n               Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. \n               He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         Sigfried.\n\n                                     TED\n                         What?\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         My name is Sigfried.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Sigfried?\n\n               Sigfried cuts a \"Something wrong with that?\" look at Ted.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         Yah, Sigfried.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Nice to meet you, Sigfried.\n\n               Ted cautiously takes Sigfried's hand.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         Very impressive, Ted. \"Theo the \n                         Thumper?\"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid. \n                         Ted it will be.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Thanks.\n\n               Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant \n               fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled \n               countdown signal that it's New Year's.\n\n               Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of \n               nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's \n               mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really \n               getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. \n               He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he \n               flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all \n               over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve \n               while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.\n\n                                     TED\n                         You okay, mister? I'll get help!\n\n               Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at \n               Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (continuing)\n                         That's the wrong door, sir.\n\n               Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the \n               gun into his crotch.\n\n               Sigfried pulls Ted's face closer to his.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         Get me the nitro... it's in the \n                         bathroom cabinet. Now!\n\n               Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling \n               mess behind.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME\n\n               Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an \n               earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place. \n               An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills \n               are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to \n               hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked \n               \"Nitro.\" No luck.\n\n               Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.\n\n               He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break.\n\n               Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm \n               through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in \n               the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-\n               bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the \n               apartment.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED (O.S.)\n                              (shouting in the \n                              distance)\n                         It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, \n                         I'm fucking dying here!\n\n               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT\n\n               Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe. \n               It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water \n               in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass \n               off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the \n               witches' room from the floor below.\n\n               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT\n\n               Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her \n               name out, to no avail.\n\n               The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for \n               help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang \n               there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have \n               found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably \n               everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody \n               hand print. It's not his blood.\n\n               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT\n\n               Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, \n               spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag \n               on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. \n               After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Hi...\n\n               No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is \n               drained from his face and he is mumbling something.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation \n                         that I can't even begin to explain, \n                         but would you be so kind as to get \n                         help? Could you call the police, \n                         please?\n\n               Silence.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (continuing)\n                         You okay?\n\n               The young man manages to belt out the word \"ice\" just before \n               hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's \n               strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the \n               bathroom. He falls back on the floor.\n\n               He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices \n               something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks \n               into the bedroom.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Ted looks around the still room. No one's there.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Sigfried?\n\n               He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his \n               eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out \n               on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side. \n               Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag \n               from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Where's the fucking nitro?\n\n                                     TED\n                         I couldn't find it!\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         You took long enough.

Do you think I should \n                         seek professional help?\n\n                                     TED\n                         It's not for everyone, but maybe in \n                         your case it could help.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                         You ever been out on the ocean at \n                         night?\n\n               Ted shakes his head.\n\n                                     SIGFRIED\n                              (continuing)\n                         I have... scary as a motherfucker, \n                         all that darkness around you. It's \n                         like a big black carpet rolled out \n                         as far as the eye can see. Sometimes, \n                         if you're lucky, you'll see a light. \n                         It could be as small as a little \n                         spark, but it will cut a path straight \n                         through all that blackness, straight \n                         to you. It could be another boat, or \n                         some distant fire on an island, but \n                         that light will shed a shining path \n                         of diamonds cutting through mile \n                         after mile of darkness to lie at \n                         your feet. That's love, Ted, it's \n                         like a path of light in an ocean of \n                         darkness.\n\n               Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed \n               by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out, \n               shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela \n               stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.\n\n               Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood. \n               Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up \n               at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands \n               the bullets to Ted.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                              (to Ted)\n                         You'd better go check to see if I \n                         killed anybody downstairs.\n\n               Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.\n\n                                     TED\n                         You people gonna be okay?\n\n               Angela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         We're fine, Ted.\n\n               Ted points to a tray with half-eaten food on it.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Would you like me to...?\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Another time, Ted.\n\n               Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at \n               the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before \n               closing the door behind him.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Ted walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic \n               Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him.\n\n                                     YOUNG GUY\n                         Happy New Year, buddy.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Happy New Year.\n\n                                     YOUNG GUY\n                         I was just in room 404, what a party! \n                         You know where room 409 is at?\n\n                                     TED\n                         Beats me. It's somewhere around here.\n\n               The guy takes off in the direction Ted's walking from. Ted \n               suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting \n               to the Young Guy.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (continuing)\n                         Hey, what's your name?\n\n               The door SLAMS on room 409.\n\n               FADE OUT\n\n               FADE TO BLACK\n\n               STORY TITLE CARD:\n\n                                         ROOM 716\n                                    \"THE MISBEHAVERS\"\n\n               FADE UP\n\n               THE FRONT DESK\n\n               SUPER: 10:30 p.m.\n\n               Ted is relaxing at the front desk. He breathes slowly. He \n               finally has one moment's peace after an already long night. \n               He even has a chance to straighten his tie.\n\n               The phone RINGS.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Front desk.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ROOM 716\n\n               CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man's mouth as he \n               speaks into the telephone.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.\n\n               Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an \n               already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to \n               face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his \n               mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.\n\n               He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his \n               tie.\n\n               He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife \n               and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a \n               beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine, \n               and Juancho, six.\n\n               Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.\n\n               He watches his Wife comb Juancho's hair down and to the side \n               like an idiot.\n\n               Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away \n               from his Wife and snatches the comb.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Give me that...\n\n               Man begins to slick Juancho's hair back.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         There... see? You look cool with \n                         your hair up like this. Like me...\n\n               Juancho is smiling now. He's happy he's going to look like \n               his dad.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Not down and to the side, all stupid \n                         like your mom likes to comb it.\n\n               Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous \n               ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her \n               long, unmanageable hair.\n\n               Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled \n               mess.\n\n               Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho's \n               hair. Juancho's hair is thinner than Man's, so it won't stay \n               up.\n\n               Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle \n               on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.\n\n               Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking \n               too, just like his dad.\n\n               Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down \n               to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down \n               at Juancho's, which won't stay up.\n\n               Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration. \n\n                                     MAN\n                         You've got your mother's hair.\n\n               In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho's hair.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I can't do anything with it.\n\n               Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho's hair back down and to \n               the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an \n               idiot again.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         There. Go.\n\n               Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.\n\n               Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.\n\n                                     WIFE\n                              (putting a plastic \n                              clip in Sarah's hair)\n                         There. Go.\n\n               Sarah exits.\n\n               Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a \n               new cigarette.\n\n                                     WIFE\n                              (mocking)\n                         So, are we gonna have fun tonight?\n\n               Man blows smoke in Wife's face as he walks out of the \n               bathroom.\n\n                                     WIFE\n                         I didn't think so.\n\n               Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.\n\n               Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels \n               turning in Man's head.\n\n               He turns back to the bathroom.\n\n               He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning \n               rubber.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Hey.\n\n               Wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband.

She covers the \n               wet spot with more cake makeup.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Hey.\n\n               The children turn to face him.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You guys are going to stay here and \n                         watch TV.\n\n               The children look at each other.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I want you to be in bed asleep before \n                         twelve.

She's looking at the \n               door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.\n\n               Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She \n               touches the edges of the fabric.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         Why did we have to get all dressed \n                         up if we weren't going with them?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

He drops the remote to the \n               floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside.

They land on \n               the bed.\n\n               Juancho is flipping channels and finds an interesting show.\n\n                                     JUANCHO\n                         Check it out.

Change it.\n\n               Juancho rolls up in a ball, the remote tucked in some recess \n               of his stomach.\n\n               Sarah hits him, then goes to the phone. She punches 0, sits \n               on the bed, and checks the name on the name tag pinned to \n               her shirt.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               FRONT DESK\n\n               Ted walks up to the front desk just as the phone rings.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Front desk.\n\n               INT.

She has an unusually adult \n               temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and \n               sees that the nudies are still in full force.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         Change the channel, now!\n\n               Juancho turns around.

He's reluctant. \n               Fearful.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         Go ahead.\n\n               He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his \n               head to her foot. Very slowly.\n\n               Sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she \n               kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed \n               and crashing to the floor.\n\n               She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the \n               channel to a cartoon.\n\n               Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander \n               about. Looking for something to do...\n\n               Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a \n               matter of time before he finds mischief.\n\n               Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for \n               the bottle.\n\n                                     JUANCHO\n                              (holding up the bottle)\n                         Hey, get a bottle opener!\n\n               Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the \n               champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she \n               wants some champagne too.\n\n               She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho \n               unwraps the bottle top.\n\n               Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few \n               hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer \n               slide forward.\n\n               Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks \n               down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and \n               casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone \n               rings.\n\n               FRONT DESK\n\n               Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room \n               404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at \n               the board and see room 716's light blinking.\n\n               He sighs in exasperation.\n\n               INT.

Send someone up here to clean \n                         this place up right.\n\n               The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho.

Oh, \n                         and bring us a couple of toothbrushes. \n                         There's a card in the bathroom that \n                         says you'll bring free toothbrushes \n                         if we ask for them.\n\n               She hangs up.\n\n               A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the \n               elevator.\n\n               Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They \n               turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the \n               taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.\n\n               Sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does.\n\n               Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how \n               to make room-to-room calls.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         I'm calling another room, give me \n                         three numbers.\n\n                                     JUANCHO\n                         4-0-9.\n\n               Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.\n\n               She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         Hello? Hi.

We've got needles here \n                         and I was wondering if they come \n                         with the room or not. Don't have \n                         any? Thanks. Just checking.\n\n               She hangs up.\n\n               Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his \n               father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes \n               one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.\n\n               Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an \n               idea.\n\n               MONTAGE:\n\n               In the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother's lipstick.\n\n               ROOM 716\n\n               Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick \n               to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She \n               writes numbers next to each circle representing points.\n\n               Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging \n               out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                              (pointing out the \n                              rules)\n                         The center is the bull's eye, 100 \n                         points, this one's 10 points, this \n                         one's 20 points.\n\n               WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point \n               slot.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out \n                         of the way!\n\n               Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to \n               the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the \n               needle into the curtain to hide it.\n\n               Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter \n               with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.\n\n               He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots \n               the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping \n               into the carpet.\n\n                                     TED\n                         I brought you some milk and cookies. \n                         If you want some you have to eat \n                         them now, because you're going to \n                         sleep.\n\n                                     SARAH\n                         We're going to sleep now?\n\n                                     TED\n                         Your parents said put you to bed \n                         before midnight.

PENTHOUSE--NIGHT\n\n               The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the \n               house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the \n               hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the \n               Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this \n               moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a \n               new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of \n               the stone. And the look on his face says, \"King's good.\" \n               Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once \n               upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, \n               at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as \n               Ted.\n\n               One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair \n               with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in \n               his hand.\n\n               The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back \n               and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to \n               the rest of the room's activity.\n\n               In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, \n               which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the \n               room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers, \n               and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                              (still sitting)\n                         Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.\n\n                                     TED\n                              (wheeling in the tray)\n                         Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got \n                         everything you asked for --\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         -- Not a problem, my friend Mr. \n                         Bellboy.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                              (closing the door)\n                         His name's Theodore.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Actually, it's not Theodore,\n                              (he throws a look at \n                              Angela)\n                         It's Ted.\n\n               Chester rises from the couch.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying -- \n                         would you care for some champagne? \n                         That's not what I was saying, but \n                         would you care for some champagne?\n\n                                     TED\n                         No, thank you.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         Ya sure?

Is there another name \n                         for what you do that I'm ignorant \n                         of?

He never says a word through \n                         the entire film. A completely silent \n                         performance. How many actors can \n                         pull that off? And he has to go to \n                         France to get respect. That says it \n                         all about America right there. The \n                         minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper \n                         in this fuckin' country gonna write \n                         articles calling the man a genius. \n                         It's not right. It's not right and \n                         it's not fair. But why should that \n                         surprise anybody? When has America \n                         ever been fair? We might be right \n                         every once in a while, but we're \n                         very rarely fair.\n\n                                     TED\n                         Where do you want this?\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         You in a hurry, Ted?\n\n                                     TED\n                              (he is, but doesn't \n                              want to rush the \n                              movie star)\n                         No, not particularly.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         Good, then stop playing \"Beat the \n                         Clock.\" Now let me introduce you to \n                         everybody.\n\n               He puts his arm around Ted and leads him around the room.\n\n               Angela crosses frame, drink in hand.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         Our friend from downstairs you already \n                         seem to be acquainted with.\n\n               As she snuggles up in a big comfy chair:\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Oh, me and Theodore go way back. \n                         Don't we, Theodore?\n\n                                     TED\n                         The name's Ted, Angela.

When he talks now it's slower and somewhat \n               distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         It's quite all right, Ted, nothing \n                         to feel sorry about. That's why God \n                         invented video. But you know, Ted, a \n                         lot of people did see it.\n\n               Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses \n               his face, and he slowly puts it down.\n\n               His manner gives the room a chill.\n\n               When he talks, he addresses the room.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         Who drank out of this bottle last?\n\n               No answer.\n\n               Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         Who drank out of this bottle -- not \n                         the other bottles -- this bottle \n                         last?\n\n                                     NORMAN\n                         What's wrong, Chester?\n\n               He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.\n\n                                     CHESTER\n                         It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's \n                         what's wrong. The champagne -- the \n                         fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat.\n\n               Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal. \n               Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo \n               walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little \n               frightened.\n\n               When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention \n               back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. \n               But it's not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so \n               far.

However, if I win, \n                         I wanna win.
