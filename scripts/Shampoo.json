He has a\n\thell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be\n\tlighthearted about it. Jill gets into the front.\n\t\n\tINT. PORSCHE\n\t\n\tThe door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet\n\tare poked out it. His head is pushing on the canvas top.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     See, nothin' to it.\n\t\n\tJill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's\n\tupper body is almost leaning on her as it is. Lester puts his\n\thand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position,\n\talmost nose to nose with Lester.\n\t\n\t               LESTER (CONT'D)\n\t     What did you say your name was,\n\t     sweetheart?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     Jill.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (not moving his head)\n\t     Jill.\n\t\n\tJill can't really move her head back and Lester is obviously\n\tcaptivated by Jill's face.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t          (trying to be casual)\n\t     -- yes, Jill.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (still holding her)\n\t     Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t          (very uncomfortable)\n\t     Thank you.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (fondling her head, moving\n\t          her closer)\n\t     -- just wonderful.\n\t\n\tPOPE\n\t\n\tis heading back to his car.

Jill shrugs to say,\n\tgee I'm sorry. Pope nods.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t     Well we'd love to, but we're going\n\t     to another party.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Well... that's wonderful -- I'll\n\t     stop by there for a drink.\n\t\n\tPope is furious. He starts the car, backs it up quickly,\n\tjostling Lester around as he goes. Lester chuckles.\n\t\n\tEXT. FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT\n\t\n\tlie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. The\n\thouse and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges\n\tand all sorts of random shrubbery. Jackie and George watch\n\tthe Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a\n\tcouple of androgenous men. The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi,\n\tarm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another\n\tend of the jacuzzi.\n\t\n\tJackie smiles. She stretches, yawns.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t          (lazily)\n\t     -- very nice, very nice.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t          (yes)\n\t     -- mmm --\n\t\n\tA pause.

Who loves a big\n\t     fanny on a man?\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Not me, pal.\n\t\n\tJackie laughs. The Twins have gotten onto some sort of\n\tsplashing contest with the boys. Water hits George and\n\tJackie. They're hit again. They shrug, George rises, takes\n\tJackie's hand. They walk on around the pool, beside and along\n\ta maze of hedgerows.\n\t\n\tEXT. SAMMY'S - THROUGH PORSCHE WINDOW\n\t\n\tas the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier\n\tand the neat hedgerows which wind around the property.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Whose place is this?\n\t\n\tINT. SAMMY'S FOYER\n\t\n\tby the open staircase. Pope is greeting Sammy. Introducing\n\tJill. Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that\n\tgoes to the knees on his levi's.\n\t\n\t               SAMMY\n\t     Sure I know Jill.\n\t\n\tLester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still\n\tsitting on the staircase, nursing her baby. She looks up,\n\tsmiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his\n\teyes off the sight.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t          (noticing)\n\t     -- the bar's in there, Les.\n\t\n\t               LES\n\t          (embarrassed)\n\t     -- oh, fine.\n\t\n\tHe strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through\n\tthe open foyer.\n\t\n\tAT THE BAR\n\t\n\twhere Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink.\n\tThe huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares\n\tat it dumbly.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (a little lamely,\n\t          indicating drink)\n\t     ... I'm...\n\t\n\tHe takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and\n\this eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on\n\this feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep\n\tsofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely\n\tmoving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke\n\tfrom the joints.\n\t\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER\n\t\n\tLester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink\n\tand almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe\n\tlights go on.\n\t\n\tLester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do\n\twith his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light\n\teffect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.\n\t\n\tINT. KITCHEN - JILL, RED DOG AND POPE\n\t\n\tJill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his\n\tmeasuring cup of wine still half filled.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     -- so what's new, Red Dog?\n\t\n\t               RED DOG\n\t     Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's\n\t     the same old shit wherever you go,\n\t     nothing ever changes.\n\t\n\tPope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t     Jill, scraves is a --\n\t\n\tHe points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like\n\the's about to enter.\n\t\n\tPope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the\n\tdirection of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had\n\ttaken earlier.\n\t\n\tLESTER\n\t\n\tpeers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt\n\tbeards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and\n\tcontinues up it until he finds himself in a den.\n\t\n\tSeveral people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and\n\twatching television. They seem a shade better dressed than\n\tthose in the kitchen.\n\t\n\tLester squints at the set which is a little blurry and\n\tpartially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of\n\tit. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a\n\tpipe.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (whispering)\n\t     -- how's it going?\n\t\n\tINT. DEN\n\t\n\t               MAN WITH PIPE\n\t          (quietly)\n\t     -- just fine.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (squinting to see)\n\t     -- is that Illinois?\n\t\n\t               MAN WITH PIPE\n\t          (taking a good look at\n\t          Lester, then)\n\t     No, that's Sally.\n\t\n\tLester looks at the screen. Sally, handled by bare arms, is\n\tbeing placed on a foam rubber cushion. She laughs.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (dumbly)\n\t     -- Sally?\n\t\n\t               MAN WITH PIPE\n\t          (pointing with his pipe\n\t          stem to a girl by\n\t          Lester's ear, also\n\t          watching the set)\n\t     -- Sally.\n\t\n\tLester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back\n\tto screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a\n\ttelevision camera and the foam rubber mattress, now\n\tabandoned. Lester shakes his head.\n\t\n\tOUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE\n\t\n\tThey're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them\n\tto a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the\n\tpool. One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     -- so when are you going to Egypt?\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t     You mean when are you going to\n\t     Egypt?\n\t\n\tJill laughs.

I\n\t     can't do that. Let's get out of\n\t     here before good old Les catches up\n\t     with us again.\n\t\n\tThere's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill\n\tturns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind.\n\tANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.\n\t\n\tINT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE\n\t\n\tGeorge has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's\n\tlooking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens\n\tagain and he closes it again.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     What's wrong?\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     -- do you want ice?\n\t\n\tInterior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     -- no.\n\t\n\tGeorge pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie.\n\tNeither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each\n\tother, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis\n\tcourt lights which someone has turned on.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t          (finally)\n\t     -- we're kidding ourselves.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t          (staring right back)\n\t     -- we are?\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     -- last night I dreamt I was fifty\n\t     years old and Mary told me I was\n\t     supposed to meet Jill at the shop.\n\t     It seared me shitless.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     Why?\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     I can't imagine being with Jill\n\t     when she's fifty years old. I can't\n\t     imagine not being with you.\n\t\n\tGeorge moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It\n\tis long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and\n\tgoes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye\n\tlatch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives\n\tslightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to\n\tJackie who stands waiting.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     -- but what about her? I don't want\n\t     to hurt Jill.\n\t\n\tGeorge takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.\n\t\n\tLESTER\n\t\n\twalks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe\n\tlights are going again in the living room.\n\t\n\tSuddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted\n\tlavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The\n\tvision disturbs him greatly.\n\t\n\tHe carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get\n\tnear her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the\n\tlights down the length of the room, going as quickly as\n\tprudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the\n\tliving room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her\n\tpoised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged\n\tpath that leads down to the pool.\n\t\n\tHe lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass\n\tdoor.\n\t\n\tJILL AND JOHNNY POPE\n\t\n\thave made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in\n\tsight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t     What's wrong?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     We can't really leave that poor man\n\t     here alone.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t     -- he'll never know the difference.\n\t\n\tJill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     -- still -- at least we should tell\n\t     him we're going. C'mon.\n\t\n\t               POPE\n\t          (going along with it,\n\t          protesting)\n\t     I'm telling you he won't know the\n\t     difference.\n\t\n\tBY THE POOL - LESTER\n\t\n\tnow with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care\n\tthat only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step\n\tis a possible disaster.\n\t\n\t               TWIN\n\t          (from Jacuzzi)\n\t     Hey.\n\t\n\tLester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is\n\toutstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the\n\tshrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.\n\t\n\t               TWIN (CONT'D)\n\t     -- it's getting soggy.\n\t\n\tLester takes it.\n\t\n\t               THE GUY WITH HER\n\t     -- just put it on the bench over\n\t     there and come on in.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     -- in there?\n\t\n\t               THE GUY\n\t     Sure.\n\t\n\tLester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it\n\tover to the bench. He puts the joint down.\n\t\n\tStares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing\n\tbeside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel\n\tloosely flung over her shoulders.\n\t\n\t               TWIN\n\t          (meaning joint)\n\t     Could I have that?\n\t\n\tLester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the\n\tother Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had\n\ttaken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the\n\tother Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy\n\tin the pool.\n\t\n\tLester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost\n\tfalling down as he does.\n\t\n\tCarrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Say --\n\t\n\t               THE GUY\n\t     -- what is it now, man?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Do you know where I can find a\n\t     towel?\n\t\n\t               THE GUY\n\t     -- the poolhouse.\n\t\n\tHolding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over\n\this boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He\n\ttries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and\n\tthe latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears\n\tthe unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense\n\tlove making. The girl is quite carried away.\n\t\n\tLester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with\n\tfetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks\n\tbetter of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly\n\tcloses the screen door.\n\t\n\tHe starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side.\n\tHe can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He\n\tmoves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man\n\tmounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity\n\tcan be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from\n\tthis angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's\n\tcries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.\n\t\n\t               JILL'S VOICE\n\t     -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --\n\t     Les, we're leaving.\n\t\n\tThe ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not\n\ttaking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope\n\tstand beside him.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Shhh --\n\t          (with genuine awe)\n\t     -- now that's what I call fucking.\n\t\n\tPope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.\n\t\n\tAs he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the\n\trefrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic\n\timpact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end\n\ttable to another end table and to the refrigerator.\n\t\n\tIt opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of\n\tGeorge and Jackie.\n\t\n\tLESTER\n\t\n\twho has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of\n\tthe image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and\n\tdetermined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks\n\tpast Jill without looking at her.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     -- what --\n\t\n\tShe turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.\n\t\n\t               JILL (CONT'D)\n\t          (watching)\n\t     Oh my God.

Jill! Jill, goddammit!\n\t\n\tHe's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who\n\thas already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose\n\tinto a purse.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     -- Jesus --\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     -- well you better go after her.\n\t\n\tHe bends down, turns his pants around, and is hopping into\n\tthem.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     -- shit...\n\t          (he grabs his shirt)\n\t     ... wait here, honey --\n\t\n\tHe runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi\n\tand into the maze of hedgerows.

He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy\n\tcovered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the\n\twall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers\n\tthrough the gate calling frantically:\n\t\n\t               GEROGE\n\t     Jill, honey?\n\t\n\tInches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare\n\tteeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George\n\tchooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the\n\thouse.\n\t\n\tHe trips and falls.\n\t\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM\n\t\n\tGeorge running through the strobe-lit party to the foyer.\n\tHe's bare-footed, but his pants are on. His frilly shirt is\n\tunbuttoned.\n\t\n\tINT.

You seen Jill?\n\t\n\t               RED DOG\n\t     She just went out the door, man.\n\t\n\tGeorge charges out the door in time to see the red Porsche's\n\ttaillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it\n\tpurrs off into the night.\n\t\n\tGeorge turns and runs back into the house and through the\n\tstrobe-lighting living room.\n\t\n\tAT THE POOLHOUSE\n\t\n\tGeorge heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse.\n\tThe refrigerator door still hangs open. Window glass is\n\tscattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his\n\tfoot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard. Jackie's gone.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Jackie?\n\t\n\tHe opens the poolhouse bathroom door.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     Jackie?\n\t\n\tHe runs back out the door of the poolhouse.\n\t\n\tEXT.

THE HOUSE\n\t\n\tGeorge runs through the living room again and the strobe\n\tlights. Again he reaches the foyer.

His foot is bleeding on the pavement.\n\t\n\tEXT. HIGH ROAD - NIGHT\n\t\n\tGeorge on his motorbike, COVERED by a few bars of Buffalo\n\tSpringfield's 'For What It's Worth,' has thrown on a peacoat\n\tbut kept on his velvet trousers. He's riding up what should\n\tnow be a familiar road to Jill's. The lights from the city\n\tbelow flash in and out of view.\n\t\n\tJILL'S GARAGE - GEORGE\n\t\n\tpulls in. Her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the\n\toil slick stares at him.\n\t\n\tThere's the SOUND of a CAR coming down the road. He looks up\n\texpectantly. As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed\n\tat his feet.\n\t\n\tGeorge turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door.\n\tHe pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.\n\t\n\tINT. JILL'S - GEORGE - NIGHT\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t          (swaying in)\n\t     Jill... Jill...

Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as\n\tusual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's\n\tparticularly kitchen.)\n\t\n\tGeorge walks over to the window and look's at the city. He\n\twalks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.\n\t\n\t                                   DISSOLVE TO:\n\t\n\tGRAY SCREEN\n\t\n\tThere is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.\n\t\n\tGeorge opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's\n\tyellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks\n\tinto the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the\n\tkitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.\n\t\n\tGeorge glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him,\n\tfrightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got\n\tno makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm\n\tand a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of\n\twhich George will note in the course of the scene.\n\t\n\tGeorge looks her up and down.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     I don't want to fight, George.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     I don't want to fight either.\n\t     Look... uh -- I love you.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     Bullshit.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t          (moving to her, taking her\n\t          arm)\n\t     I do, Jill.\n\t\n\tAt this point he notes the arm bruise. Jill stares back at\n\thim unflinching. George smiles.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     How come you took your own car?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t          (getting a cigarette)\n\t     I didn't want him meeting me here.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Well that's something.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     What is.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     You didn't plan on fucking him\n\t     tonight.\n\t\n\tJill doesn't answer.\n\t\n\tShe walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to\n\ttake off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe\n\tover it.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     You did fuck him, didn't you?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     I'm very tired, George.\n\t\n\tJill goes into the living room.

Yes... no, everything's\n\t     fine, really... bye.\n\t\n\tShe hangs up.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     That was him.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     Yes.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     You told him I was here and he\n\t     wanted to know if I was beating you\n\t     up.\n\t\n\tJill smiles thinly.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     Yes.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Well, did you get a job out of it\n\t     at least?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     I'd like you to leave now.\n\t\n\tGeorge doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote\n\tbag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.\n\t\n\t               JILL (CONT'D)\n\t     -- and take this with you.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Where did this come from?\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     Who knows, I'm sure you don't --\n\t     but if it'll help any, I found it\n\t     in your bed.\n\t\n\tGeorge nods. Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is\n\tbeginning to surface now. Tears start welling in her eyes.\n\t\n\t               JILL (CONT'D)\n\t          (unsteadily)\n\t     So who else was there besides\n\t     Jackie?

I just don't\n\t     want girls looking at me and\n\t     knowing and me not knowing...\n\t\n\tJill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. George\n\tmoves to her and tries to put his arms around her.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Baby, please don't...

Now all\n\tGeorge's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to\n\ttouch her and stands his ground, exploding:\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     You dumb cunt, everybody fucks\n\t     everybody, grow up, for Christ's\n\t     sakes.

That's why I went to\n\t     beauty school, to fuck. I can't\n\t     help that, they're there and I do\n\t     their hair and sometimes I fuck\n\t     'em. I stick it in and I pull it\n\t     out and that's a fuck, it's not a\n\t     crime.\n\t\n\tGeorge leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not\n\teven bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together\n\ta little more by the speech.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     ... well I'm glad you told me.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t          (his eyes closed)\n\t     Jesus.\n\t\n\tHis tone has indicated disbelief and disgust.\n\t\n\t               JILL\n\t     I am...

GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM\n\t\n\tGeorge finds himself facing Lester and two other MEN who look\n\tlike hoods. Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other\n\tnight. Before him is a bottle of J & B, a paper bucket filled\n\twith melting ice. The other men rise when George walks into\n\tthe room.\n\t\n\tLester, glass in hand, stares silently at George.\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (to the other two)\n\t     Wait outside, would you?\n\t\n\tThe two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side,\n\tcoming very close. Both of them are much bigger than George.\n\tThey stare through George as they pass him.\n\t\n\tGeorge continues to stand there. Lester, drinking, continues\n\tto stare. Lester glances idly around the living room. Then\n\tback to George.\n\t\n\t               LESTER (CONT'D)\n\t     You live like a pig.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Yeah.\n\t          (Lester doesn't answer)\n\t     How long have you been here?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t          (looking it)\n\t     All night.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Well... who are those guys?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     What do they look like?...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Look, Lester... are you unhappy\n\t     with me about something?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about\n\t     something.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Well, what?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Godammit, George...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Now wait a minute...\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     Sit down.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     But...\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     I said sit down!\n\t\n\tOne of the men opens the door and peers through the screen.\n\t\n\t               MAN\n\t     Everything all right?\n\t\n\t               LESTER\n\t     I'll call you, it's okay.\n\t\n\tGeorge site down.

She grabs\n\tone of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down\n\tbelow her.\n\t\n\tHer house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck\n\tjust pulling away.\n\t\n\tGeorge comes up to her.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t          (looking below her)\n\t     You're going to kill me.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     No --\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t          (turning to him,\n\t          imploring)\n\t     Well then what are you trying to do-\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     I want to marry you. I want to take\n\t     care of you and I want your\n\t     children, and I want you to be my\n\t     girl. That's all I want. That's all\n\t     I want out of my life, and it's a\n\t     lot.\n\t\n\tShe stares at him in disbelief. She actually clutches her\n\tstomach.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     Look, I don't know if I'll ever\n\t     make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but\n\t     I'll take care of you, I'll make\n\t     you happy, I swear to God I will.\n\t\n\tJackie doesn't answer. She slowly sinks to the ground. George\n\tsinks beside her. Her eyes are wet.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t     Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for\n\t     God's sake, answer me.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     If you knew how many times I wanted\n\t     to hear you say that...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     So I'm saying it...\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     It's too late...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     What's too late about it? Look,\n\t     we're not dead, are we? That's the\n\t     only thing that's too late.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     Lester's left Felicia. He's taking\n\t     me to Acapulco on the five o'clock\n\t     flight. He's asked me to marry him.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     So what? You don't love him, do\n\t     you? Answer me.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     What's that supposed to mean?\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     I don't know... Jackie?\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     What?\n\t\n\tGeorge now is very near tears himself. What he says now he\n\thas to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he\n\tholds.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     I don't trust... anyone... but\n\t     you...\n\t\n\tGeorge lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,\n\tsupported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly\n\ton her shoulder. She has her arm around him.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     Oh my baby...\n\t\n\tAs she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's\n\tsilver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to\n\tthe front door.\n\t\n\t               JACKIE (CONT'D)\n\t     God, there's Lester...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Don't go, Jackie...\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     I can't just let him stand by the\n\t     door...\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     Don't leave me...\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     I've got to... I've got to tell him\n\t     where I am.\n\t\n\t               GEORGE\n\t     What for?\n\t\n\t               JACKIE\n\t     I don't know -- I've got to.\n\t\n\tShe gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes\n\tback down the hill. George sits under the television aerial\n\tand watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing\n\tINTO VIEW.\n\t\n\tFinally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.\n\tShe hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk\n\tfor a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving\n\tLester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.\n\t\n\tGeorge is watching them.\n\t\n\tHe sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his\n\tarm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going\n\tthrough the front door.\n\t\n\tTHE END\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nShampoo\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Robert Towne\u00a0\u00a0Warren Beatty\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:35:30.097091"}
