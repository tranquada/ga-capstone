Look,\n\t     we're not dead, are we? That's the\n\t     only thing that's too late.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     Lester's left Felicia. He's taking\n\t     me to Acapulco on the five o'clock\n\t     flight. He's asked me to marry him.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     So what? You don't love him, do\n\t     you? Answer me.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     What's that supposed to mean?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     I don't know... Jackie?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     What?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tGeorge now is very near tears himself. What he says now he\n\thas to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he\n\tholds.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     I don't trust... anyone... but\n\t     you...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tGeorge lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,\n\tsupported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly\n\ton her shoulder. She has her arm around him.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     Oh my baby...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAs she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's\n\tsilver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to\n\tthe front door.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t     God, there's Lester...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     Don't go, Jackie...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     I can't just let him stand by the\n\t     door...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     Don't leave me...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     I've got to... I've got to tell him\n\t     where I am.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               GEORGE\n</b>\t     What for?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t               JACKIE\n</b>\t     I don't know -- I've got to.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes\n\tback down the hill. George sits under the television aerial\n\tand watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing\n<b>\tINTO VIEW.\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tFinally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.\n\tShe hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk\n\tfor a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving\n\tLester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tGeorge is watching them.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his\n\tarm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going\n\tthrough the front door.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tTHE END\n</b><b>\t\n</b></pre>\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Shampoo</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Robert Towne\" title=\"Scripts by Robert Towne\">Robert Towne</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Warren Beatty\" title=\"Scripts by Warren Beatty\">Warren Beatty</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Shampoo Script.html#comments\" title=\"Shampoo comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:16.114219"}
