The ground shakes from \n\twhat seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building \n\tdebris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines \n\tcoming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much \n\tlike a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the \n\tfootsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more \n\tintense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS \n\tSHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan \n\tup, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-\n\tshirt, then we hear the familiar, \"Huh huh huh.\" - only it's a \n\thuge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. \"Butt-\n\tKong\" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and \n\tbuildings and saying, \"This is cool. Huh huh huh.\"\n\t\tAirplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). \n\tHe looks irritated and says, \"Cut it out butt-munch!\" Butt-Head \n\tswats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and \n\tstomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head \n\treaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a \n\tlot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in \n\this hand and goes wide-eyed, \"Whoa! Huh huh huh.\" The woman \n\tscreams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few \n\tlame pick up lines. \"Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh \n\thuh huh.\" He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, \n\t\"Dammit, I'm trying to score!\" The helicopter goes down in flames. \n\tWe CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice \n\tgiant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank \n\taround. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT \n\tBEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more \n\tdestructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). \n\tBeavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head \n\tputs the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling \n\tthe city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.\n\t\tWe CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking \n\tButt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking \n\thim.\n\t\n\t\n\tINT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS (O.C.)\n\t\t\tButt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!\n\t\n\tButt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tButt-Head, wake up, wake up!\n\t\n\tButt-Head comes around.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tDammit, Beavis, I was about to score.\n\t\t\tHuh huh.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tYeah, but check it out. It's gone!\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tWhat's gone?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tThe TV.\n\t\n\tBeavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.\n\t\n\tButt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV \n\twas.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tUuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...\n\t\n\tOut the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their \n\tvan.\n\t\n\tStill on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We \n\tsee a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.\n\t\n\tButt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN \n\tDOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this \n\ta couple of times - piecing it all together.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD (CONT.)\n\t\t\tWhoa! I think I just figured something\n\t\t\tout Beavis.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tThis sucks.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tYeah, heh heh.\n\t\n\tBeavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where \n\tthe TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.\n\t\n\tBeavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on \n\tthe remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tThis sucks more than anything that\n\t\t\thas ever sucked before. We must find\n\t\t\tthis butt-hole that took the TV.\n\t\n\t\n\tEXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBad neighborhood. 70's music blares.\n\t\n\tA fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in \n\tfear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, \n\tchain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes \n\toff his glasses.\n\t\n\tFREEZE ON BEAVIS\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\t\tBeavis!\n\t\n\tFRAME UNFREEZES.

He wears a leisure suit, \n\tcollar way open. He plops down in the bed.\n\t\n\tFREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\t\tButt-Head!\n\t\n\tFRAME UNFREEZES.

Styled like a 70's cop show opening.\n\t\n\tOPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits \n\twould.\n\t\n\tBeavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.\n\t\n\tButt-Head slaps a pimp.\n\t\n\tBeavis drives, chasing a car.\n\t\n\tButt-Head is slapped by a girl.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tHuh huh huh. That was cool.\n\t\n\tBeavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.\n\t\n\tA black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.\n\t\n\tB&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.\n\t\n\tIn CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.\n\t\n\tButt-Head does the same.\n\t\n\tBeavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.\n\t\n\tA beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. \n\tFINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into \n\tbed. Suddenly...\n\t\n\t\n\tINT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tFrom inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.\n\t\n\tB&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables \n\tattached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push \n\tthe cart we hear more equipment falling.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tDammit, it's stuck.\n\t\n\tThey give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that \n\tthe cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which \n\tall come crashing to the ground.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD (CONT.)\n\t\t\tHuh huh huh.

They lamely \n\tattempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy \n\tand goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tHuh huh huh. That was cool.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tNo it wasn't!\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tUh,...Oh yeah.\n\t\n\tB&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. \n\tPRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMcVICKER\n\t\t\tWhy....

ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK\n\t\n\tB&B watch a \"Cops\"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the \n\trefrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the \n\tcounter on which the TV is sitting.\n\t\n\tBeavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL \n\tOVER THE TOP OF THE TV.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tAAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!\n\t\n\tANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the \n\tTV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX.

We're all\n\t\t\tgonna die!\n\t\n\tThe plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the \n\tplane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down \n\tthe aisle.\n\t\n\tON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.\n\t\n\tIn free fall:\n\t\n\tButt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes \n\ttearing out.\n\t\n\tButt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which \n\topen and spill their contents.\n\t\n\tButt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and \n\tcoffee to pour freely.\n\t\n\tON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their \n\tscreaming.\n\t\n\tON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out.

Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\t\t\t(to Tammy)\n\t\t\tSo, uh huh huh, are you going to Las\n\t\t\tVegas? Huh huh huh.\n\t\n\tTammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.\n\t\n\tANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.\n\t\n\tPAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The \n\tguy's asleep.\n\t\n\tButt-head picks up the beer.\n\t\n\tANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. \n\tBeavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, \n\tetc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)\n\t\n\tTammy reaches her next passenger.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTAMMY\n\t\t\tHi, we're serving dinner.

We hear several CALL BUTTONS being \n\tpressed.\n\t\n\tON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTT-HEAD\n\t\t\tUh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.\n\t\n\tANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.\n\t\n\tThe PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit \n\tslams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAVIS\n\t\t\tBargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!\n\t\n\tThe pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee \n\tto spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain \n\tthen jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A \n\tNOSE-DIVE.\n\t\n\tON BUTT-HEAD\n\t\n\tIn the back of the plane standing next to Tammy.
