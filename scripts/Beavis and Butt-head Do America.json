The ground shakes from \n\twhat seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building \n\tdebris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines \n\tcoming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much \n\tlike a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the \n\tfootsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more \n\tintense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS \n\tSHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan \n\tup, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-\n\tshirt, then we hear the familiar, \"Huh huh huh.\" - only it's a \n\thuge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. \"Butt-\n\tKong\" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and \n\tbuildings and saying, \"This is cool. Huh huh huh.\"\n\t\tAirplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). \n\tHe looks irritated and says, \"Cut it out butt-munch!\" Butt-Head \n\tswats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and \n\tstomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head \n\treaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a \n\tlot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in \n\this hand and goes wide-eyed, \"Whoa! Huh huh huh.\" The woman \n\tscreams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few \n\tlame pick up lines. \"Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh \n\thuh huh.\" He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, \n\t\"Dammit, I'm trying to score!\" The helicopter goes down in flames. \n\tWe CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice \n\tgiant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank \n\taround. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT \n\tBEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more \n\tdestructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). \n\tBeavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head \n\tputs the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling \n\tthe city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.\n\t\tWe CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking \n\tButt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking \n\thim.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT.
