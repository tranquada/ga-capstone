INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT\n</b>\nThis whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, \ntapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is \nbruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their \nclarity.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three \ncards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards \nyou're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any \nkind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty-\nfive to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit \nrunning in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and \nfinally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell-\ntale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because \nit took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, \nnot make one. So you want to play?\n\n<b>DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n</b>\n<b>FADE IN:\n</b>\nWhat have you got?\n\nWe cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned \nover: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good \nhand. A flush beats my pair. What about you?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\nAnother pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: \na run is revealed.\n\nAnd here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all \nhustlers!\n\nWe cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You \ngot some real money?\n\n<b>DISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n</b>\n<b>FADE IN:\n</b>\nEd scoops up a large pile of money.\n\nOdds chaps, you gotta remember the odds.\n\nThere ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman \nwho has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players \nare also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with \nembarrassment.\n\n<b>SERG\n</b>I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can \nfeel a case of the flu coming on and . . .\n\n<b>SERG\n</b>(interrupts)\nAll right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; \nbut before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.\n\n<b>DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.\n</b>\nWe pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in \nthe inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK \nSTOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We \nwait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then \nsee one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING \nBARRELS joins the sentence.]\n\n<b>EXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY\n</b>\nWe open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery \non a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming \nvolume at which he is advertising his wares.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-\nby-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here \nshopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a \nbag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten \npounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not \neighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten \npounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man \nwho sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you \nhere today I would make more money with me measuring tape.\n\nA well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd \nwaving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you \nsay? I'll have five.\n\nCertainly sir. I'll just wrap.\n\nChanging his attention.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.\n\nA tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot. \nShe fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of \nthe crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like \nit's contaminated. Others follow suit.\n\nBuy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been \npaid for.\n\nThis really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as \nbusiness reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first \nenthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first \npretended.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Bacon!\n\nBacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms \nbetween Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal \nthere is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done \nthis before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>(voice-over)\nEd can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's \nfucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(voice-over)\nThe reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the \npolice station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big \nboy now and it is time to move on.\n\nWe cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.\n\n<b>INT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING\n</b>\nEDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick \nthe Greek.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.\n\n<b>NICK\n</b>Of course you are. All right, Ed.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?\n\nTom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Please, both join me in my orifice.\n\n<b>INT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThey work their way past a maze of boxes.\n\n<b>NICK\n</b>(fingering and admiring one of the boxes)\nHow much did you say it was, Tom?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>You know how much it is, Nick.\n\n<b>NICK\n</b>And that does include the amp?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>You know it doesn't include the amp.\n\n<b>INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON\n</b>\nTom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This \nis obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of \nthe man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head \nchef. Meet Soap.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>What have you come as?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you \nTom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in \nyour fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a \ngrocer's.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be \nsurprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind \nthat, what about the money?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Get your fingers out of my soup!\n\n<b>SLOW MOTION\n</b>\nSoap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>(voice-over)\nSoap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any \nunlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that \nit's legal.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>(voice-over)\n He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he \ndoesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.\n\n<b>16\n</b>\n<b>RELEASE SLOW MOTION]\n</b>\nEd looks in bag.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I \nsee it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat \nman and Bacon?\n\nTom looks on with suspicion.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Who's this fat man, then?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nA hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk. \nOn this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a \njudge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a \nhazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A \ncabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split \nscreen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with \none hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>You got it all?\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>A hundred grand.\n\n<b>FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n</b>\n<b>TOM\n</b>(voice-over)\nYou see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved \nhas to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(voice-over)\nThe man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry \nas some including himself like to call him.\n\n<b>RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .\n\nThe phone is slammed down.\n\n<b>SHOT OF HATCHET\n</b>\n<b>SOAP\n</b>(voice-over)\nWhen the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts \nthat ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>(voice-over)\nSex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's \nstone cold heart.\n\nCut from completed film.\n\n<b>RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>What's this EDDY like, then?\n\nThe camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting \nopposite Hatchet. Meet Barry the Baptist.\n\n<b>FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(voice-over)\nHatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>(voice-over)\nThe Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>(voice-over)\nBut he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled \nand jobs get done.\n\n<b>RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY\n</b>\n<b>BARRY\n</b>EDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a \nrare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . \n<b>.\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>(interrupts)\nAll right, all right, so we can say he is good.\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>Better than good, he is a fucking liability.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Where did he get a hundred grand?\n\n<b>20\n</b>\n<b>BARRY\n</b>\nHe has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, \nI got it under control.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Good, you can get this under control now.\n\nA glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique \nhammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face.\n\nIt seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little \nbeauties are up for auction, but I am not paying quarter of a million \nquid for 'em, if you know what I mean Barry. One of my associates has \ngiven me an address and the location of these lovelies. Make sure we \nget everything from inside the gun cabinet. I don't want to know who \nyou use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them \nwhat they're worth.\n\nChanging the subject.\n\n'Ere! Hold on, what do you think of these? We are selling hundreds.\n\nHolds up one of the spanking paddles.\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!\n\nThe paddle is brought down hard on the desk: slap.\n\n<b>INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nMeet the Dog. Dog is horrible. He is large and intimidating. \nAdministering pain is Dog's forte. He is also the Guy we cut from the \nlast scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball. Wallop. Dog pulls a \nsadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.\n\nWe see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but \notherwise naked. An orange is stuck in the man's mouth. Dog is standing \non another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where \nDog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure. The tied-up man \nis Gordon. The other is Slick. Gordon nods his head erratically \nimplying that he has reached a decision.\n\n(to Plank)\nI think your man is trying to say something.\n\nPause.\n\nPerhaps not; maybe I should have another swing just to make sure.\n\nAgonised muffled screaming from Gordon. Slick (who has a tee in his \nmouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon.\n\nYes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us?\n\nThe orange is removed from Gordon's mouth.\n\n<b>GORDON\n</b>(rushing to get the words out)\nIn the kitchen, under the floor . . .\n\n<b>SLICK\n</b>(interrupts)\nShut it, you idiot . . .\n\nDog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>You were saying?\n\n<b>GORDON\n</b>It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for \ngod's sake let me down.\n\n<b>PLANK\n</b>Oh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!\n\nPlank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash. Gordon starts to \nscream. Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across \nthe room. Thunk. Silence follows. Plank grimaces.\n\nOh, Dog!\n\n<b>EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING\n</b>\nEd, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they \npass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other, \nand go to their separate doors.\n\n<b>INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nBACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps \nlooking at his plate distastefully.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the \npound. You don't need to count it.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I still will, if you don't mind.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>(eating)\nSo, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and \ntwenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous \nexperiences.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>That's going on optimism.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking \ncourse.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be \nfunny, but you're not.\n\nTom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He \nexamines himself to see if something has developed.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?\n\nThe light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to \ncower in a sharp defensive action.\n\nJesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding . \n. . Why the hell did you move in?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Because it's cheap like a budgie.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; \na bit anti-social, you know.\n\nBACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>What do you mean?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>He means they're thieving dogs.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping \noff unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.\n\nBACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The \nnoise from next door immediately gets louder.\n\nNot exactly thick, these walls.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>(off)\nNo you prat, that's for me.\n\n<b>INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nDog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his \nlads.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job \nworth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you \nhave a problem with that?\n\nHe obviously doesn't.\n\n<b>INT. ED AIVD BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nTom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon.\n\nEXT. BIG BOY'S GYM/SOLARiUM - NIGHT\n\nMeet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old).\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>How long has he been in there, son?\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>About twenty minutes.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Is he on his own?\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>Just carrying a bag.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Let's have a look, shall we?\n\n<b>INT. GYM/SOLARIUM - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Son, have a look under that one.\n\nLittle Chris looks under one of the sunbeds.\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>It's not him, Dad.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Try that one.\n\nLittle Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation.\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>Sleeping like a baby.\n\nBig Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?\n\nJohn O'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him \nas hard as he can.\n\nGot some bad news for you, John.\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>What the fu-!\n\nBig Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Mind your language in front of my boy.\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>Jesus Christ!\n\nBig Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>That includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .\n\n<b>JOHN'O'DRISCOLL\n</b>Tell you what, Chris?\n\nA man opens the sunbed mom door.\n\n<b>SUNBED MAN\n</b>I say, hold on.\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>I say shut it!\n\n<b>SUNBED MAN\n</b>You what?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>He said shut it!\n\nChris pulls a mean face; the door is closed.]\n\nTell me John, how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan, and it \nis a lovely tan by the way, when you have more pressing priorities at \nhand?\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>Tell Harry . . .\n\nBang as sunbed comes down again.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me \nand chose your words carefully. You may speak.\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am \nnearly there.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Son, have a look in his locker.\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n<b>30\n</b>\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Yeah, all right.\n\nBig Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to \nlift it up again?\n\nLittle Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has \nflown through it.\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his \nwallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in \nyour pocket?\n\nThe expression on Big Chris's face changes.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRTS\n</b>Sorry, Dad.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in \na plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan \nhas faded, you want to have paid.\n\nChris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up.\n\n<b>INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nJD's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with \npretty girls serving a laddish clientele. The boys are propped up at \nthe bar, looking straight ahead in silence. They look nervous. The \nsilence is broken by Ed.\n\n<b>32\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I am going to the john.\n\nHe walks off.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get \nyour rest in.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Tom, you're all heart.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; \nit's in all our interests.\n\n<b>JD\n</b>(the bar owner and Ed's father)\nAll right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? \nWhere's that son of mine?\n\nEach time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left \nwith their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks \nthrough the bar (Daisy).\n\n<b>INT. SLOANES' HOUSE LABORATORY - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being \ncultivated for profit. Someone is smoking a joint and raising his \neyebrows at his friend. These two characters are J and Charles; they \nhave got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and \nscience-lab coats, with nothing much underneath.\n\n<b>J\n</b>(coughing)\nThis gear is getting heavier you know, Charles. I got a suspicion we \nshould have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or \nsomething.\n\nA horn blows (the door bell).\n\n<b>CHARLES\n</b>Who the hell is that?\n\n<b>INT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe door opens to reveal Willy. Under each arm is a large bag of \nfertilizer.\n\n<b>WILLY\n</b>Give me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second.\n\nA voice comes from behind them. At the top of the stairs stands \nWinston. He slowly starts to walk down.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>Charles, why have we got this cage?\n\nPause. Charlie shrugs.\n\n<b>CHARLIE\n</b>Er, for security.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>That's right, for security. So tell me, Charles, what's the point in \nhaving it if we don't fucking use it?\n\n<b>CHARLIE\n</b>Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?\n\n<b>WILLY\n</b>Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the \nproblem?\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest \nof cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep \nthe fucking cage locked.\n\nPause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted \nat. Winston sighs and looks at what Willy is carrying.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>What are you carrying, Willy?\n\n<b>WILLY\n</b>Er, fertilizer.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back \ncarrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.\n\n<b>WILLY\n</b>We need fertilizer, Winston.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money \nout by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if \nyou have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more \nsubtle?\n\n<b>WILLY\n</b>What do you mean?\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your \naverage hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.\n\nWinston turns on his heels and walks off. 35\n\n<b>INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nEd returns to the bar to find Tom, Soap and BACON\nlooking in disbelief.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>(pointing to watch)\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Why, what's up?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet \nHarry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!\n\nEd grimaces as his father approaches. He has overheard this last \nstatement.\n\nJD You playing cards tonight with Harry?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(pauses)\nDon't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.\n\n<b>INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe calm down for a while. A cool track is playing. Ed is now smartly \ndressed, sitting in an armchair. We have a close-up of his face. He is \nmotionless, eyes closed; he looks asleep. The camera slowly tracks down \nhis body We reach a single hand; he is cutting the pack skilfully and \nfaultlessly; he is very much awake. There is a knock on his door. His \neyes open.\n\n<b>INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nNear-naked girls are gyrating against blue poles, which keep \ndistracting these men's attention. Meet the two Scousers - Gary and \nDean. The Scousers are in their late twenties, one big, one small. Gary \n(the smaller) sports a large demi-perm. They bear strong Liverpudlian \naccents. They are meeting Barry (Hatchet's man).\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . \n. Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There \nwill be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you \ndeliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>(sarcastically)\nOh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>Like what?\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>Like antiques.\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>Antiques?

Everybody else is sitting down \ncounting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only \nempty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it \nsupposed to be symbolic?\n\n<b>40\n</b>\n<b>PHIL/DON\n</b>All right Ed.

BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nBarry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch \nmonitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table. \nThe camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms \nin, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to \nview his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He \nhasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's \nother hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut \nstraight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse.\n\n<b>46\n</b>\n<b>BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Listen ladies, this is cards.

Don continues to search \nEd's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry \nas a desert disco.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the \nanti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.\n\nSilence.\n\n<b>EXT.

STATELY HOME - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large \nhouse.\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>All right, Kenny.\n\nDean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking \npulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an \nartificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A \nbig bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.\n(Lovingly rearranging his hair)\nIf you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're \nmistaken, Kenny.\n\n<b>INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n</b>\nMusic starts. We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work. Ed \nmust be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of \npaper are being signed; IOUs.\n\n<b>INT. STATELY HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nDean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a \nlarge bedroom. There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied \nup in bed. The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary \nhas seen fit to light, in order to extract information.

We've got the guns; now if you \ndon't mind . . .\n\nAt that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun \ncartridge. The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance. He is \nholding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the \ncatalogue) which he has obviously got little control of. The recoil \nknocks the butler clear off his feet. The second shot hits the ceiling \ncovering the old boy in plaster.\n\nWe cut to a POV of the butler on his back. We see Dean looking down.\n\nYou want to be more careful, old fella. You very nearly took my man's \nhead clean off with that. You all right, Kenny?\n\nWe cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape. The gun shot has \ntorn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a \npair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears. Shock prevents him from answering.\n\nKenny?\n\n<b>INT.

EDDY frowns slightly This is odd play. \nRather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder; \nsatisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money.\n\nDon't go spending, that all at once, boy.\n\n<b>INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nBarry's phone rings. He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it.\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>What?\n\n<b>50 ~ 51\n</b>\n<b>INT.

Barry excitedly starts tapping \naway.\n\n<b>53\n</b>\n<b>INT.

Two \nhundred and fifty.\n\nHatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a \nnervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills \nframe. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow \nEventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the \npause is broken.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY\n\nAs you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough \nto continue.\n\nPause.\n\n<b>CROUPIER\n</b>We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to \ncontinue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.\n\nSilence follows. A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary \ndirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining \ncompany.\n\nIt doesn't look . . .\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>(interrupts)\nI will.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>You will what?\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>I will loan you the money.\n\nSilence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a \nsecond, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its \nlong silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's \ncards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this \nworrying news.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I think I would rather just turn them over.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I \nam also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over \nbecause you can borrow.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I need two hundred and fifty grand.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>No, you need five hundred grand to see me.\n\nEd's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>That's if I want to see you.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.\n\nThe pause is painful.\n\n<b>55\n</b>\n<b>CRUOPIER\n</b>You can still fold.\n\nEDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. \nHarry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier \npleads with Eddy.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I'll see ya.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>For half a million?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can \nstill fold.\n(Pause)\nOK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money \nback within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?\n\nThese last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He \nis committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet \nturns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY\nushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; \nthen the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a \nloud pause . . .\n\n<b>CROUPIER\n</b>Is that it?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n<b>56\n</b>\n<b>FRAZER\n</b>He was bluffing!\n\nHatchet looks content and rather nonchalant.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Let's see your fucking cards.\n\nNobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY \nexpectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They \ncontract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever.\n\n<b>FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(voice-over)\nI knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the \ntable had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A \nseries of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted \nwith a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred \nthousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.\n\n<b>RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY\n</b>\nHarry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give \nyou all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of \nyou and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; \nand when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?\n\nEd gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to \nstand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the \ntop.\n\nBusiness is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your \ndad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in \na week, a few fingers and a bar for starters.\n\nEd stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door.\n\n<b>INT.

We cut between the lads and their \nfrozen reaction.\n\n<b>FREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(voice-over)\nI then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going \nto start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was \nno way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as \ntheir money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I \nhate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I \nsaid I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.\n\n<b>RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.\n\nTom drops his drink and rushes Eddy.\n\n<b>58\n</b>\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'll kill him!\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>(intercepts Tom)\nStop fucking around, Tom, and think.

Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached \nfor the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch \nblack rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death \nwith this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet \nHarry is a man you pay if you owe.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I'll think of something, don't worry.\n\n<b>EXT.

Then you send back the cheques for \ntwenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot \nFan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they \nhave sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; \nnot a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he \ntickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!\n\nThere is a long pause while BACON considers this.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Probably no longer than four weeks.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>A month?

His dad used \nto collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy \nwill after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested \nthem to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old \nNick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never \nnicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the \nbow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he \nfound ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a \nrunaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who \ntouches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting.\n\nWe see Big Chris walking up the stairs. He reaches the top and knocks \non the door.\n\n<b>INT.

If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them \naround a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt \nany one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think \nknives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones \nthat look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because \nthey don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to \nuse them.

If looks could kill Plank \nwould be pushing up daisies.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>(gun to the head of Winston)\nWhere?\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>Out the back.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>And the weed?\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>Out the back.\n\n<b>MICK\n</b>Point.\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>With what?\n\n<b>MICK\n</b>Your hands, now!\n\n<b>WINSTON\n</b>I can't, I am tied up.\n\n<b>98\n</b>\n<b>MICK\n</b>Well, well, shake your head or something.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>All right Plank, get Paul out of the van.\n\nThis is done on a walky talky.\n\n<b>INT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He \nturns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight \ninto Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger \nas he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming \nuncontrollably\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>(to Plank)\nGive us your knife.\n\nDog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to \nits source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and \nslumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand.\n\n(the point of the blade resting on William's throat)\nEnough! Mick, how you doing?\n\n<b>MICK\n</b>How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.\n\nDog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly \npacked and stacked.\n\nPAUL (in doorway visibly shocked\nGordon Bennett! What's been going on in here?\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get \nthis all in the van.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.\n\n<b>EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nA traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will \nmove it for you.\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>I'll only be a minute.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>You've already been fifteen.\n\nPaul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are \nnecessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the \nstreet: the coast is clear.\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>Look. Go on, look.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>At what, exactly?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>My van is half full.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>So?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.\n\nHaving made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back \ndoors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The \nmomentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another \nquick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper \ninto the vehicle.\n\n<b>INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n<b>PLANK\n</b>My neck, Dog.\n(Dog shows no sign of pity)\nThat's the last bag?\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>(Turning to Mick.)\nHow about you? All right?\n\n<b>MICK\n</b>I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the \nmachete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Do it quietly.\n\nGloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and \ntroop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising \nthe gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the \nsure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away \nfrom her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body \nof Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat. \nGloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, \nknew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover \nand Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best. \nEventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, \ngoes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes \ncautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes. \nDog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her \non the jaw Gloria is knocked out.\n\nWhat was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up. \nWe are getting out of here.\n\n<b>EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>BACON\n</b>Eh, bunk us up over the wall.\n\nBACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the \nothers over.

He \nshrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>What are you doing, Ed?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>\nDo you want one?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>And look what happened to that.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.\n\n<b>INT. DOG'S VAN - DAY\n</b>\nDog turns to admire a full van.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>You won't get away with it.\n\nDog turns around and sees the tragic warden.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Paul, what's that?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>That's a traffic warden.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>(looking straight at Paul)\nWhat's he doing in the van?\n\nDog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>He was about to call the cozzers.\n\nPaul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>We will deal with him later.\n\nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY Tom is on the mobile phone.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>They're here.\n\n<b>INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nDog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and \nis met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing \nhis chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts. \nIt's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump \nout of their positions.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Down, down, get fucking down now'\n\nThis is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem \nnot to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his \ngun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the \nfloor immediately.\n\n<b>EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nPaul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is \nmet by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead \npipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged \nin screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>I'll find you.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one.

Look, what's this?\n\nHe holds up the hat.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.\n\nPause.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. \nWhat did they want with a traffic warden?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.\n\n<b>INT.

Even if it was a bug they would have taken \nit with 'em.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and \nthat is good enough for me.

JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nAll kinds of characters have made an appearance. A game of cards is in \nmotion, the forfeit now being alcohol. Barfly Jack the barman is \nsitting at the table. They are already on the road to being comfortably \ncomatose.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Rory Breaker?\n\n<b>114\n</b>\n<b>BARFLY JACK\n</b>Yeah, I know Rory.\n\nThis next section is subtitled. This is to keep everyone, even those \nfamiliar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration, of \nwhich even Tom is unsure. As with the police scene earlier this is a \nvoice-over and we cut to the relevant scenes.\n\n<b>BARFLYJACK\n</b>(voice-over)\nRory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey \nand kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist. \nA few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the \nbattle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching \nthe custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens \nand he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it \nsomewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to \nmiss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a \nfire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are \nready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then \norders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and \nswitches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory \ngobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match \ninto his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, \nunfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos \nran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won \ntoo, four-nil.\n\n<b>EXT.JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nAfter a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to \npursue her, running out on to the street.

But what you do know is where these people live.\n\nWe look at the white faced Nick. He doesn't open his mouth. The penny \nhas dropped.\n\nIf you hold anything back, I'll kill you. If you bend the truth, or if \nI think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you. If you forget \nanything, I'll kill you. In fact, you're going to have to work very \nhard to stay alive, Nick. I hope you understand everything\n\nI have said. Because if you don't, I'll kill you. Now, Mr Bubble and \nSqueak. You may now enlighten me.\n\n<b>INT.

You \ncould say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking \nEverest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a \nmon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first \nfucking idea who did this to us, do you?\n\n<b>PLANK\n</b>Dog, we have been up all night.

It's a blood-covered Plank.\n\n<b>RORY BREAKER\n</b>This is one of them.\n\nWinston nods in confirmation.\n\nLucky, that.\n\nBang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and \nPlank despatch each other simultaneously.\n\n<b>INT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n</b>\nTom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks \nhave they got between them?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Six.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>How many wings have they got between them?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Twelve.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>How many feet?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Er, well, twelve.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>How the fuck should I know?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white \npussy?]\n\nThe end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, \ndangerously close. The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop \noutside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money.\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n<b>127\n</b>\n<b>EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>BACON\n</b>What has been going on here?\n\nThey look into a smoking, blood-covered house.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>The money, the gear!\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been \nswapped for a pile of corpses.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>OK, don't panic; let's think about this.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am \npanicking and I am off mate.\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\nBig Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office. The door opens and \nout walks John O'Driscoll with a serious sunburn.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Hello, John. Nice holiday?\n\n<b>JOHN O'DRISCOLL\n</b>I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.\n\n<b>128\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>(off)\nThat you, Chris?\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>How did you get your hands on these?\n\nHe drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the \nguns he has been after. He then tries desperately to conceal his \nexcitement.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted \nthem?\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.\n\n<b>BARRY\n</b>Was it any trouble getting the money?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Have you counted the money?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>They were going to pay, then?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my \nexperience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>Good job, Chris.\n\nChris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet. Harry is \necstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself.\n\n<b>EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nThe Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>We gotta get those guns.\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.\n\n<b>DEAN\n</b>Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be \npreferable to death by Hatchet.\n\n<b>GARY\n</b>Furry muff, let's go.\n\n<b>EXT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) - DAY\n</b>\n<b>SOAP\n</b>I hope this is the right move.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am \ngoing to call him.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>As if he'll care.\n\n<b>130\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares \nabout us is different. Pass your phone.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY\n</b>\nThe two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs. \nThere's only one door in front of them. Dean gets ready to kick it \nopen. Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style \nkick.\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nHarry is in his offtce playing with his guns. The phone rings.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>That you, boy?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(on phone)\nIt's Ed, if that's what you mean.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>It's pay day, ain't it?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>(on phone)\nI wanted to talk to you about that.\n\n<b>HATCHET\n</b>I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, \nwhich means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few \npeople, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what \ndoes concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. \nGet your arse over here now, and I do mean now!\n\n<b>INT. ED'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\nEd puts the phone down after a pause. His state of shock is obvious to \nthe rest of the lads.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Well?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Well what?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>(impatiently)\nWell, what did he say?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those \nguns . . . now.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>You what? What are you on about?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we \nshould go and see him.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start \nmaking sense.\n\n<b>133\n</b>\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nWe cut to a time Lapse. Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his \nbum on the front of his desk. He is ecstatic with the guns. He loads \nand plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds.\n\nThe door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a \nScouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying \nthrough his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the \ndecision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is \nhe holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the \ndoorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, \nholding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair \nare blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry \nhas effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually \nshattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers. \nThere is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective \ntargets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is \nairborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's \nbullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to \nstop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past \nhim.\n\nOvertaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and \nproceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed. Hatchet flies over \nhis desk. Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last \nbullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk. It is \nthen revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door. The \nScourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face. Barry throws \nthe hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block. It hits \nGary in the back. Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in \nBarry's stomach. It is then clear to them both that this has all been a \nterrible mistake.\n\n<b>BARRY/GARY\n</b>What are you doing here?\n\nThen both collapse into dead lumps on the floor.\n\n<b>EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE ED'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>You and me, Tom.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>What do you mean, me?\n\nThey stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when \nTom notices it's open.\n\n<b>INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY EDDY\n</b>\nOh Jesus, not again.\n\nThe two pause while they build their confidence. They enter Hatchet \nHarry's room. It's still smoky. There on the table is the money.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>That's it, I am off.\n\nEd tiptoes over to the bag containing the money.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Tom, this is our case.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>. . . What?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.\n\nTom sees his guns. His eyes widen in surprise.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.\n\n<b>136\n</b>\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Tom, don't mess around, let's go.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'11 meet you in the car.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Tom?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'll only be a minute.\n\n<b>EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE/CHRIS'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>A job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.\n\nAs he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little \nboy\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Son?\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?\n\nWe can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along \nthe front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back. \nBig Chris assesses the situation.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>You all right back there, mate?\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want \nto see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>All right, furry muff.\n\nBig Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and \nstarts the car.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>What are you doing?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.\n\n<b>DOG\n</b>You had better be careful.\n\nBig Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little \nChris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets \nfaster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. \nChris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. \nBANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.\n\n<b>INT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nAnother time lapse.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>Well, what's going on?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which \nmeans there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more \nproblem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they \nare all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything \nwrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.\n\nBang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash \ngoes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked \nunconscious.\n\n<b>INT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY\n</b>\nBig Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to \nsmash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing \nso.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to \nme as you have.\n\nDog is being thrown around like a rag doll.\n\n<b>INT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE\n</b>\nWe are looking through a two-way mirror.\n\n<b>SERG\n</b>Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need \nto know what's going on, Edward.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.\n\nThe camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a \npoliceman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he \nshakes his head.\n\n<b>TRAFFIC WARDEN\n</b>No, that's not one of them.\n\nThe policeman then knocks on the door.\n\n<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on \nhis own. After a short pause the door bursts open.\n\n<b>SERG\n</b>All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here.\n\n<b>FADE IN TO BLACK.\n</b>\n<b>FADE IN.\n</b>\n<b>INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nAll the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is \ninterested in whatever he has to say.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so \nthat put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because \nthere is no evidence against us.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Apart from those shotguns.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>And Tom took care of them.\n\nPause while Tom looks embarrassed about something.\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?\n\nEd looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I wanted to talk to you about that.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>Well, talk.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought \nwe might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a \nproblem getting hold of him.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>\nYou dippy bastard.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car \nwhich is sitting outside?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them \nto you, could they?\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.\n\n<b>BACON\n</b>And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP\n\nNow, Tom! There is a pause.\n\n<b>ALTOGETHER\n</b>Now, Tom!\n\nTom leaves, looking a little sulky.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>The silly sod.\n\nBig Chris walks in. He approaches the bar.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b><b>JD.\n</b>\n<b>JD\n</b>Chris.\n(Pause)\nYou come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Nope.\n\n<b>JD\n</b>Can I help?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>I think I can help you, as it happens.\n\n<b>JD\n</b>Yes?\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.\n\n<b>JD\n</b>Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.\n\nThey all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it \non the table, which increases the shock factor.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have \ncost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have \ndecided to bring your bag back.\n\nPause. The words you are looking for start with thank you.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>Thank you.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any \nmore. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that \nis unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be \nwaving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last \nlittle visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been \nemotional.\n\nBig Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each \nother.\n\n<b>EXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nBig Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car. \nLittle Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-\nloaning business, all right, son?\n\n<b>LITTLE CHRIS\n</b>All right, Dad.\n\n<b>BIG CHRIS\n</b>Well, put your seatbelt on then.\n\n<b>INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nEd goes forward to open the case. The rest are still in shock. Ed opens \nthe bag.\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>There's nothing in it!\n\n<b>SOAP\n</b>What do you mean?\n\n<b>EDDY\n</b>I mean it's fucking empty.\n\nBACON  lunges forward and stares in. He sticks his hand in and extracts \nan A4 envelope. They look puzzled. Ed feels the package and starts to \ntear the top off. As this is done it creates a split screen.\n\nOn the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the \ncar boot open. He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last \npolish. Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail. \nSimultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns. They \nstill look confused. They turn the brochure upside down and recognize \nthe shotguns. Slowly they start to turn the pages.\n\nTorn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall. He starts \nwalking but stops for some reason. He retreads his steps and peers \nover; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf.\n\nEd sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between \neyes and prices. They panic and reach for their mobile phones.\n\nTom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with \none arm.\n\nEd starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and \nasks them to put their phones down.\n\nTom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail. His mobile phone \nstarts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let \ngo of the rail to answer the phone.\n\nThe shot freezes.\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Guy Ritchie\" title=\"Scripts by Guy Ritchie\">Guy Ritchie</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Script.html#comments\" title=\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:10:29.048211"}
