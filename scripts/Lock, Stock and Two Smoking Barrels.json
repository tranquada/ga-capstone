INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT\n\nThis whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, \ntapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is \nbruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their \nclarity.\n\nEDDY\nThree card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three \ncards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards \nyou're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any \nkind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty-\nfive to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit \nrunning in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and \nfinally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell-\ntale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because \nit took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, \nnot make one. So you want to play?\n\nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nWhat have you got?\n\nWe cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned \nover: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good \nhand. A flush beats my pair. What about you?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\nAnother pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: \na run is revealed.\n\nAnd here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all \nhustlers!\n\nWe cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You \ngot some real money?\n\nDISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEd scoops up a large pile of money.\n\nOdds chaps, you gotta remember the odds.\n\nThere ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman \nwho has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players \nare also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with \nembarrassment.\n\nSERG\nI hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?\n\nEDDY\nI haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can \nfeel a case of the flu coming on and . . .\n\nSERG\n(interrupts)\nAll right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; \nbut before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.\n\nEDDY\nIf you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.\n\nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.\n\nWe pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in \nthe inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK \nSTOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We \nwait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then \nsee one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING \nBARRELS joins the sentence.]\n\nEXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY\n\nWe open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery \non a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming \nvolume at which he is advertising his wares.\n\nBACON\nSee these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-\nby-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here \nshopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a \nbag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten \npounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not \neighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten \npounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man \nwho sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you \nhere today I would make more money with me measuring tape.\n\nA well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd \nwaving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.\n\nEDDY\nBargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you \nsay? I'll have five.\n\nCertainly sir. I'll just wrap.\n\nChanging his attention.\n\nBACON\nExcuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.\n\nA tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot. \nShe fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of \nthe crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like \nit's contaminated. Others follow suit.\n\nBuy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been \npaid for.\n\nThis really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as \nbusiness reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first \nenthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first \npretended.\n\nEDDY\nBacon!\n\nBacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms \nbetween Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal \nthere is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done \nthis before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.\n\nBACON\n(voice-over)\nEd can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's \nfucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.\n\nEDDY\n(voice-over)\nThe reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the \npolice station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big \nboy now and it is time to move on.\n\nWe cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.\n\nINT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING\n\nEDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick \nthe Greek.\n\nTOM\nWhat are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.\n\nNICK\nOf course you are. All right, Ed.\n\nEDDY\nNick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?\n\nTom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression.\n\nTOM\nPlease, both join me in my orifice.\n\nINT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY\n\nThey work their way past a maze of boxes.\n\nNICK\n(fingering and admiring one of the boxes)\nHow much did you say it was, Tom?\n\nTOM\nYou know how much it is, Nick.\n\nNICK\nAnd that does include the amp?\n\nTOM\nYou know it doesn't include the amp.\n\nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON\n\nTom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This \nis obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of \nthe man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head \nchef. Meet Soap.\n\nTOM\nWhat have you come as?\n\nSOAP\nCupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you \nTom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in \nyour fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a \ngrocer's.\n\nTOM\nIf you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be \nsurprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind \nthat, what about the money?\n\nSOAP\nGet your fingers out of my soup!\n\nSLOW MOTION\n\nSoap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting.\n\nTOM\n(voice-over)\nSoap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any \nunlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that \nit's legal.\n\nBACON\n(voice-over)\n He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he \ndoesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.\n\n16\n\nRELEASE SLOW MOTION]\n\nEd looks in bag.\n\nEDDY\nAre you sure you can afford twenty-five?\n\nSOAP\nWell that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I \nsee it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat \nman and Bacon?\n\nTom looks on with suspicion.\n\nTOM\nWho's this fat man, then?\n\nEDDY\nBacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nA hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk. \nOn this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a \njudge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a \nhazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A \ncabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split \nscreen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with \none hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun.\n\nHATCHET\nYou got it all?\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n\nEDDY\nA hundred grand.\n\nFREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n\nTOM\n(voice-over)\nYou see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved \nhas to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.\n\nEDDY\n(voice-over)\nThe man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry \nas some including himself like to call him.\n\nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n\nHATCHET\nWell if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .\n\nThe phone is slammed down.\n\nSHOT OF HATCHET\n\nSOAP\n(voice-over)\nWhen the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts \nthat ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.\n\nBACON\n(voice-over)\nSex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's \nstone cold heart.\n\nCut from completed film.\n\nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET\n\nHATCHET\nWhat's this EDDY like, then?\n\nThe camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting \nopposite Hatchet. Meet Barry the Baptist.\n\nFREEZE SHOT OF BARRY\n\nEDDY\n(voice-over)\nHatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.\n\nBACON\n(voice-over)\nThe Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.\n\nTOM\n(voice-over)\nBut he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled \nand jobs get done.\n\nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY\n\nBARRY\nEDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a \nrare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . \n.\n\nHATCHET\n(interrupts)\nAll right, all right, so we can say he is good.\n\nBARRY\nBetter than good, he is a fucking liability.\n\nHATCHET\nWhere did he get a hundred grand?\n\n20\n\nBARRY\n\nHe has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them.\n\nHATCHET\nAnd JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?\n\nBARRY\nNo mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, \nI got it under control.\n\nHATCHET\nGood, you can get this under control now.\n\nA glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique \nhammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face.\n\nIt seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little \nbeauties are up for auction, but I am not paying quarter of a million \nquid for 'em, if you know what I mean Barry. One of my associates has \ngiven me an address and the location of these lovelies. Make sure we \nget everything from inside the gun cabinet. I don't want to know who \nyou use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them \nwhat they're worth.\n\nChanging the subject.\n\n'Ere! Hold on, what do you think of these? We are selling hundreds.\n\nHolds up one of the spanking paddles.\n\nBARRY\nEr, very nice Harry. What's it for?\n\nHATCHET\nDon't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!\n\nThe paddle is brought down hard on the desk: slap.\n\nINT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY\n\nMeet the Dog. Dog is horrible. He is large and intimidating. \nAdministering pain is Dog's forte. He is also the Guy we cut from the \nlast scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball. Wallop. Dog pulls a \nsadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face.\n\nDOG\nIt's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.\n\nWe see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but \notherwise naked. An orange is stuck in the man's mouth. Dog is standing \non another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where \nDog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure. The tied-up man \nis Gordon. The other is Slick. Gordon nods his head erratically \nimplying that he has reached a decision.\n\n(to Plank)\nI think your man is trying to say something.\n\nPause.\n\nPerhaps not; maybe I should have another swing just to make sure.\n\nAgonised muffled screaming from Gordon. Slick (who has a tee in his \nmouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon.\n\nYes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us?\n\nThe orange is removed from Gordon's mouth.\n\nGORDON\n(rushing to get the words out)\nIn the kitchen, under the floor . . .\n\nSLICK\n(interrupts)\nShut it, you idiot . . .\n\nDog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious.\n\nDOG\nYou were saying?\n\nGORDON\nIt's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for \ngod's sake let me down.\n\nPLANK\nOh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!\n\nPlank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash. Gordon starts to \nscream. Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across \nthe room. Thunk. Silence follows. Plank grimaces.\n\nOh, Dog!\n\nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING\n\nEd, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they \npass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other, \nand go to their separate doors.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nBACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps \nlooking at his plate distastefully.\n\nBACON\nTwenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the \npound. You don't need to count it.\n\nEDDY\nI still will, if you don't mind.\n\nTOM\n(eating)\nSo, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and \ntwenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous \nexperiences.\n\nSOAP\nThat's going on optimism.\n\nTOM\nWhatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking \ncourse.\n\nSOAP\nYou're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be \nfunny, but you're not.\n\nTom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He \nexamines himself to see if something has developed.\n\nTOM\nFat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?\n\nThe light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to \ncower in a sharp defensive action.\n\nJesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding . \n. . Why the hell did you move in?\n\nEDDY\nBecause it's cheap like a budgie.\n\nBACON\nAnd nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; \na bit anti-social, you know.\n\nBACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall.\n\nTOM\nWhat do you mean?\n\nEDDY\nHe means they're thieving dogs.\n\nBACON\nI mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping \noff unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.\n\nBACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The \nnoise from next door immediately gets louder.\n\nNot exactly thick, these walls.\n\nDOG\n(off)\nNo you prat, that's for me.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his \nlads.\n\nDOG\nHow many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job \nworth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you \nhave a problem with that?\n\nHe obviously doesn't.\n\nINT. ED AIVD BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nTom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon.\n\nEXT. BIG BOY'S GYM/SOLARiUM - NIGHT\n\nMeet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old).\n\nBIG CHRIS\nHow long has he been in there, son?\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nAbout twenty minutes.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nIs he on his own?\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nJust carrying a bag.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nLet's have a look, shall we?\n\nINT. GYM/SOLARIUM - NIGHT\n\nBIG CHRIS\nSon, have a look under that one.\n\nLittle Chris looks under one of the sunbeds.\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nIt's not him, Dad.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nTry that one.\n\nLittle Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation.\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nSleeping like a baby.\n\nBig Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nThis is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?\n\nJohn O'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him \nas hard as he can.\n\nGot some bad news for you, John.\n\nJOHN O'DRISCOLL\nWhat the fu-!\n\nBig Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nMind your language in front of my boy.\n\nJOHN O'DRISCOLL\nJesus Christ!\n\nBig Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nThat includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .\n\nJOHN'O'DRISCOLL\nTell you what, Chris?\n\nA man opens the sunbed mom door.\n\nSUNBED MAN\nI say, hold on.\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nI say shut it!\n\nSUNBED MAN\nYou what?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nHe said shut it!\n\nChris pulls a mean face; the door is closed.]\n\nTell me John, how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan, and it \nis a lovely tan by the way, when you have more pressing priorities at \nhand?\n\nJOHN O'DRISCOLL\nTell Harry . . .\n\nBang as sunbed comes down again.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nDid I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me \nand chose your words carefully. You may speak.\n\nJOHN O'DRISCOLL\nI'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am \nnearly there.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nSon, have a look in his locker.\n\nJOHN O'DRISCOLL\nNo chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n30\n\nBIG CHRIS\nYeah, all right.\n\nBig Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to \nlift it up again?\n\nLittle Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has \nflown through it.\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nHe's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his \nwallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in \nyour pocket?\n\nThe expression on Big Chris's face changes.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nOi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!\n\nLITTLE CHRTS\nSorry, Dad.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nRight, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in \na plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan \nhas faded, you want to have paid.\n\nChris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nJD's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with \npretty girls serving a laddish clientele. The boys are propped up at \nthe bar, looking straight ahead in silence. They look nervous. The \nsilence is broken by Ed.\n\n32\n\nEDDY\nI am going to the john.\n\nHe walks off.\n\nTOM\nWhat you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get \nyour rest in.\n\nSOAP\nTom, you're all heart.\n\nTOM\nListen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; \nit's in all our interests.\n\nJD\n(the bar owner and Ed's father)\nAll right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? \nWhere's that son of mine?\n\nEach time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left \nwith their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks \nthrough the bar (Daisy).\n\nINT. SLOANES' HOUSE LABORATORY - NIGHT\n\nWe cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being \ncultivated for profit. Someone is smoking a joint and raising his \neyebrows at his friend. These two characters are J and Charles; they \nhave got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and \nscience-lab coats, with nothing much underneath.\n\nJ\n(coughing)\nThis gear is getting heavier you know, Charles. I got a suspicion we \nshould have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or \nsomething.\n\nA horn blows (the door bell).\n\nCHARLES\nWho the hell is that?\n\nINT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe door opens to reveal Willy. Under each arm is a large bag of \nfertilizer.\n\nWILLY\nGive me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second.\n\nA voice comes from behind them. At the top of the stairs stands \nWinston. He slowly starts to walk down.\n\nWINSTON\nCharles, why have we got this cage?\n\nPause. Charlie shrugs.\n\nCHARLIE\nEr, for security.\n\nWINSTON\nThat's right, for security. So tell me, Charles, what's the point in \nhaving it if we don't fucking use it?\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.\n\nWINSTON\nYes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?\n\nWILLY\nChill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the \nproblem?\n\nWINSTON\nThe problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest \nof cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep \nthe fucking cage locked.\n\nPause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted \nat. Winston sighs and looks at what Willy is carrying.\n\nWINSTON\nWhat are you carrying, Willy?\n\nWILLY\nEr, fertilizer.\n\nWINSTON\nYou went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back \ncarrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.\n\nWILLY\nWe need fertilizer, Winston.\n\nWINSTON\nWe also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money \nout by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if \nyou have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more \nsubtle?\n\nWILLY\nWhat do you mean?\n\nWINSTON\nI mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your \naverage hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.\n\nWinston turns on his heels and walks off. 35\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nEd returns to the bar to find Tom, Soap and BACON\nlooking in disbelief.\n\nTOM\n(pointing to watch)\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\n\nEDDY\nWhy, what's up?\n\nTOM\nEr, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet \nHarry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!\n\nEd grimaces as his father approaches. He has overheard this last \nstatement.\n\nJD You playing cards tonight with Harry?\n\nEDDY\n(pauses)\nDon't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nWe calm down for a while. A cool track is playing. Ed is now smartly \ndressed, sitting in an armchair. We have a close-up of his face. He is \nmotionless, eyes closed; he looks asleep. The camera slowly tracks down \nhis body We reach a single hand; he is cutting the pack skilfully and \nfaultlessly; he is very much awake. There is a knock on his door. His \neyes open.\n\nINT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT\n\nNear-naked girls are gyrating against blue poles, which keep \ndistracting these men's attention. Meet the two Scousers - Gary and \nDean. The Scousers are in their late twenties, one big, one small. Gary \n(the smaller) sports a large demi-perm. They bear strong Liverpudlian \naccents. They are meeting Barry (Hatchet's man).\n\nGARY\nShotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?\n\nBARRY\nOh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . \n. Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There \nwill be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you \ndeliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.\n\nGARY\n(sarcastically)\nOh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.\n\nBARRY\nIt's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.\n\nDEAN\nLike what?\n\nBARRY\nLike antiques.\n\nDEAN\nAntiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices \nand steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?\n\nBARRY\nIf it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and \nrob the place.\n\nGARY\nSo who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?\n\nBARRY\nYou're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that \nbecause you need to know.\n\nGARY\nI see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond \nfilm, is it?\n\nBARRY\nCareful, remember who's giving you this job.\n\nA bit of confused eye-rolling goes on. Barry eventually looks at his \nwatch.\n\nI am off, it's all yours now. Call me when you're done.\n\nAs he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully.\n\nGARY\n(to Dean)\nI hate these Southern shites.\n\nBARRY\n(on his way out, whispering to himself)\nFucking Northern monkeys.\n\nEXT. BOXING CLUB ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\nEDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their \nappearance. They are met by a doorman.\n\nDOORMAN\nInvitations.\n\nEDDY\nInvitations?\n\nDOORMAN\nYeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name \non it.\n\nEDDY\nWell we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with \nthe Queen on it. Will that do?\n\nDOORMAN\nAll right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.\n\nEDDY\nSamoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .\n\nDOORMAN\nHold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I \ndo mean no one.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nEDDY enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the \nthought of climbing into the ring. Everybody else is sitting down \ncounting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only \nempty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind.\n\nEDDY\nEvening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it \nsupposed to be symbolic?\n\n40\n\nPHIL/DON\nAll right Ed. Apparently it's for security.\n\nEDDY\nI would have brought my gloves if I had known.\n\nHATCHET\nYou must be Eddy. JD's son.\n\nEDDY\nYup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.\n\nHATCHET\nNever mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.\n\nThere is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards. EDDY\n\nEvening Tanya, it has been a while.\n\nEXT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT\n\nAs the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door \ncovered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out. \nThe lads look on in mild shock.\n\nTOM\nI heard this place was rough.\n\nEXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT\n\nThe Scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock-\npicking kit. '\n\n42\n\nSAMOAN Jo's - NIGHT\n\nSOAP\nWhat sort of a pub is this then?\n\nSAMOAN JO\nA Samoan one. Anything else?\n\nBACON\n(receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail)\nWhat's that?\n\nSAMOAN JO\nA cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.\n\nBACON\nNo, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a \nfucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.\n\nSAMOAN JO\nYou want a pint, go to the pub.\n\nBACON\nI thought this was a pub.\n\nSAMOAN JO\nIt's a Samoan pub.\n\nBACON\nWell whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?\n\nSAMOAN JO\nYou ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.\n\nBACON looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the TV.\n\nBACON\nExcuse me, could you turn the TV down?\n\nRORY BREAKER\nNo.\n\nHe takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon. BACON \nfrowns back, then Soap interrupts.\n\nSOAP\nThis is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nCROUPIER\nThis is three card brag, gentlemen. That means that three threes is the \nhighest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a \nrunning flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a \nblind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent. \nDon't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know I won't \nstand for it.\n\nFRAZER\nWhat sort of shirt is that then, Ed? 'Three hundred open.\n\nEDDY\nThe type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, \nFrazer. One hundred and fifty blind.\n\nDON\nThree hundred and fifty open.\n\nPHIL\nFold.\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\nHATCHET\nThree hundred and fifty open.\n\nFRAZER\nYou're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that. Three \nhundred and fifty open.\n\nEDDY\nNo Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the \npleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.\n\nDON\nFour hundred open.\n\nHATCHET\nFour hundred open.\n\nFRAZER\nEight hundred. Like that, do ya, son?\n\nEDDY\nWhen my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch \nmonitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table. \nThe camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms \nin, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to \nview his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He \nhasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's \nother hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut \nstraight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse.\n\n46\n\nBOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nHATCHET\nListen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you \nshould be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play.\n(dramatic pause)\nI fold.\n\nFRAZER\nTwo thousand open.\n\nEDDY\nOne thousand blind.\n\nDON\nTwo thousand open.\n\nFRAZER\nDeep end, eh? Fold.\n\nEDDY\nTwo thousand blind.\n\nDON\nYou what?\n\nThere is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of  \nnerves.\n\nTwo grand? You're still blind. You have been eating too much English \nbeef, mate; honkers, mad.\n\nHATCHET\nWell, you going to play?\n\nCut from completed film.\n\nDON\nFucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there.\n\nCROUPIER\nFour thousand to an open man, you know that.\n\nWe can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy. Don continues to search \nEd's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry \nas a desert disco.\n\nEDDY\nDonald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the \nanti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.\n\nSilence.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT.\n\nDon is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing.\n\nEXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT\n\nThe Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large \nhouse.\n\nDEAN\nOK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?\n\nGARY\nAll right, Kenny.\n\nDean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking \npulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an \nartificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A \nbig bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.\n\nDEAN\nCan't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?\n\nGARY\nIt just cost me fifty quid to have this done.\n(Lovingly rearranging his hair)\nIf you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're \nmistaken, Kenny.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nMusic starts. We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work. Ed \nmust be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of \npaper are being signed; IOUs.\n\nINT. STATELY HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nDean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a \nlarge bedroom. There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied \nup in bed. The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary \nhas seen fit to light, in order to extract information. Briefly meet \nLord and Lady Appleton Smythe Winston and Daisy's parents).\n\nDEAN\nWhat are you doing, Kenny?\n\nGary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue.\n\nGARY\nFinding out where he keeps the money.\n\n48 49\n\nDEAN\nKenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money? \nThey can't even afford new furniture. We've got the guns; now if you \ndon't mind . . .\n\nAt that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun \ncartridge. The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance. He is \nholding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the \ncatalogue) which he has obviously got little control of. The recoil \nknocks the butler clear off his feet. The second shot hits the ceiling \ncovering the old boy in plaster.\n\nWe cut to a POV of the butler on his back. We see Dean looking down.\n\nYou want to be more careful, old fella. You very nearly took my man's \nhead clean off with that. You all right, Kenny?\n\nWe cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape. The gun shot has \ntorn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a \npair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears. Shock prevents him from answering.\n\nKenny?\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nEDDY\nTen grand blind.\n\nWe see Hatchet feeling his leg; he looks shifty\n\nINT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarry zooms in again; he can see nothing.\n\nHATCHET\nTwenty thousand open.\n\nEDDY looks at his cards: he has a running flush.\n\nEDDY\nTwenty thousand open.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nHaving received this information Hatchet pauses, then . . .\n\nHATCHET\nI'll fold.\n\nWe hear lots of oohs and aahs. EDDY frowns slightly This is odd play. \nRather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder; \nsatisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money.\n\nDon't go spending, that all at once, boy.\n\nINT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarry's phone rings. He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it.\n\nBARRY\nWhat?\n\n50 ~ 51\n\nINT. RED PHONE BOX - NIGHT\n\nThe Scousers reply; Gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun \nexperience.\n\nDEAN\nI thought you said no staff, Bazza!\n\nBARRY\nYou get the guns?\n\nDEAN\nYou should see what they did to poor Gary.\n\nGary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously \ndoesn't know what day of the week it is.\n\nDEAN\nGary, get back into the van!\n\nBarry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em.\n\nBARRY\nGood. I'll speak to you later.\n\nBarry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as \nif speaking to a deaf person.\n\nDEAN\nGary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the \nvan now, OK?\n\nDean takes his arm and guides him back into the van.\n\nBOXING GYM - NIGHT\n\nStakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at \nhis cards.\n\nEDDY\nTwenty thousand open.\n\nPHIL\nOK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going \non here. I fold.\n\nHATCHET\nGot some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy?\n\nHatchet looks impatiently at the door.\n\nEDDY\nFifty grand.\n\nHatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry.\n\nHATCHET\nEighty grand.\n\nBOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly \nzooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just\nenough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards!\n\nEd's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping \naway.\n\n53\n\nINT. BOXING GYM - MGHT\n\nEDDY\nOne hundred grand.\n\nFRAZER\nHold on fellas, I know . . .\n\nHATCHER (interrupts j\nI know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two \nhundred and fifty.\n\nHatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a \nnervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills \nframe. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow \nEventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the \npause is broken.\n\nEDDY\nThat is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.\n\nHATCHET\nYes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY\n\nAs you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough \nto continue.\n\nPause.\n\nCROUPIER\nWe will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to \ncontinue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.\n\nSilence follows. A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary \ndirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining \ncompany.\n\nIt doesn't look . . .\n\nHATCHET\n(interrupts)\nI will.\n\nEDDY\nYou will what?\n\nHATCHET\nI will loan you the money.\n\nSilence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a \nsecond, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its \nlong silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's \ncards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this \nworrying news.\n\nEDDY\nI think I would rather just turn them over.\n\nHATCHET\nI am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I \nam also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over \nbecause you can borrow.\n\nEDDY\nI need two hundred and fifty grand.\n\nHATCHET\nNo, you need five hundred grand to see me.\n\nEd's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat.\n\nEDDY\nThat's if I want to see you.\n\nHATCHET\nWell, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.\n\nThe pause is painful.\n\n55\n\nCRUOPIER\nYou can still fold.\n\nEDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. \nHarry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier \npleads with Eddy.\n\nEDDY\nI'll see ya.\n\nHATCHET\nFor half a million?\n\nEDDY\nUnless you are going to accept twenty quid.\n\nHATCHET\nAnd still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can \nstill fold.\n(Pause)\nOK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money \nback within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?\n\nThese last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He \nis committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet \nturns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY\nushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; \nthen the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a \nloud pause . . .\n\nCROUPIER\nIs that it?\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n56\n\nFRAZER\nHe was bluffing!\n\nHatchet looks content and rather nonchalant.\n\nHATCHET\nLet's see your fucking cards.\n\nNobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY \nexpectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They \ncontract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever.\n\nFREEZE SHOT OF EDDY\n\nEDDY\n(voice-over)\nI knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the \ntable had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A \nseries of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted \nwith a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred \nthousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.\n\nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY\n\nHarry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear.\n\nHATCHET\nI know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give \nyou all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of \nyou and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; \nand when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?\n\nEd gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to \nstand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the \ntop.\n\nBusiness is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your \ndad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in \na week, a few fingers and a bar for starters.\n\nEd stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door.\n\nINT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT\n\nEd has made his way into the bar. All his friends have fallen asleep. \nOne of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up.\n\nBACON\nThis doesn't look good.\n\nThe others wake on this statement. We cut between the lads and their \nfrozen reaction.\n\nFREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK\n\nEDDY\n(voice-over)\nI then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going \nto start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was \nno way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as \ntheir money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I \nhate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I \nsaid I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.\n\nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS\n\nEDDY\nListen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.\n\nTom drops his drink and rushes Eddy.\n\n58\n\nTOM\nI'll kill him!\n\nBACON\n(intercepts Tom)\nStop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?\n\nSOAP\nWhat's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?\n\nThey all look at Soap like he is mad.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S' OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nBACON\n(voice-over)\nLet me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called \nSmithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on \nthe take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't \ndo a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached \nfor the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch \nblack rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death \nwith this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet \nHarry is a man you pay if you owe.\n\nEDDY\nI'll think of something, don't worry.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nEd, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day \nstubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles \nalong the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He \nstops outside JD's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in.\n\n60\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY The ridiculous door-bell horn blows.\n\nJ\nWho the hell's that. It's only twelve.\n\nWINSTON\nUse that cage, that's what it's there for.\n\nWILLIAM\n(off)\nWho is it?\n\nPLANK\n(off)\nPlank, open up.\n\nThis is done without the use of the steel-caged security door.\n\nThis weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas. Gloria \nremains motionless in her chair. Plank waves his hand about in a sort \nof `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat. At the last \nminute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to \nsit on this girl.\n\nJesus! Never saw you there. Hello, love. Enjoying yourself?\n\nGloria doesn't respond. Plank waves his hand over her face. Still no \nresponse. Plank looks around for some acknowledgement.\n\nIs she, er, compus?\n\nWINSTON\n(doesn't look up)\nWhat do you think?\n\nPlank takes a close look at the girl.\n\n61\n\nGIRL\nBOO!\n\nPlank jumps back, completely taken by surprise, knocking over a \npedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall, full of fifty-pound \nnotes.\n\nPLANK\nFuck me!\n\nCharles, pissed off, looks at William like it's his fault.\n\nCHARLES\nFod God's sake.\n\nWILLIAM\nClean that up, Charles.\n\nCHARLES\nSod you, you clean it up.\n\nPLANK\nSorry fellas, but that stupid cow!\n\nWILLIAM\nNever mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.\n\nWINSTON\nAnyway, how much do you want?\n\nPLANK\n(trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him)\nI am after a half weight.\n\nWINSTON\nThat's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out \nthe gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money?\n\nINT. JD' S BAR - DAY\n\nCut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of JD's bar. \nThey don't look a lot better than Ed.\n\nBACON\nThe odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.\n\nSOAP\nI would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds \nare a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON\n. . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?\n\nBACON\nAt the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.\n\nSOAP\nIt's hit us all hard!\n\nBACON\nYeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.\n\nTom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts.\n\nTOM\nListen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's \nFaggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, \nadvertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er \n. . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and \ngreatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all \nthat bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the \npleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to \nthe company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, \nfor twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them \nclear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for \ntwenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot \nFan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they \nhave sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; \nnot a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he \ntickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!\n\nThere is a long pause while BACON considers this.\n\nBACON\nSo how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?\n\nTOM\nProbably no longer than four weeks.\n\nBACON\nA month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six \n. . . no, five days?\n\nTOM\nWell, it's still a good idea.\n\nSOAP\nListen to this one . . .\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nWe see the back of a head.\n\nDOG\nSo do you know these geezers well?\n\nPLANK\nWell enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of \nyears.\n\nDOG\nWhat they like then?\n\nPLANK\nPoofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY\n\nSoap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money.\n\nSOAP\nAnd you keep all the money'\n\nPause. BACON and Tom frown at Soap.\n\nTOM\nI have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes \nBacon's sound inspired.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nEd fumbles with his keys at his front door. He enters his house in a \nsort of zombie state, takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard \ndoors. He hangs his coat up (it promptly falls off\" the hanger) and he \ncollapses in a pile on the floor. The cupboard doors now being open, he \ncan clearly hear next door's discussion. We track in very slowly on Ed.\n\nPLANK\nThey ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks. \nThey're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got \nbigger than what they can keep up with.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY\n\nSOAP\nIf you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion?\n\nBACON\nI am thinking, I am thinking.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDOG\n(off)\nListen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash \nsitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class A gear and you don't think \nthere is anybody sensible involved.\n\nWe reach the end of our track. Ed's head is on a pitiful angle in full \nclose-up. It straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this \nnews.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDOG\n\nWhat about security?\n\nPLANK\nThere's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.\n\nDOG\nWhat do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?\n\nPLANK\nI must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not \nsuspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that \nkarma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.\n\nDOG\nIs there no way they can get back to you?\n\nPLANK\nEven if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; \nthey're gutless faggots.\n\n66 ~ 67\n\nIN'T. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nBarry and Harry are talking. Harry is polishing a shotgun. It is very \ndifferent in appearance to the hammer-locks.\n\nHATCHET\n\nIs Big Chris on his way?\n\nBARRY\nShould be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry. \nThat's a lot of money for Chris to be running after. I wouldn't trust \nhim to bring it back here.\n\nHatchet's speech is laced with cut-aways of Big Chris in action, and on \nthe ascent (with Little Chris) of Hatchet's stairs.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nHATCHET\n(voice-over) \nWhat do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he \nwill make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used \nto collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy \nwill after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested \nthem to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old \nNick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never \nnicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the \nbow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he \nfound ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a \nrunaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who \ntouches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting.\n\nWe see Big Chris walking up the stairs. He reaches the top and knocks \non the door.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nBig Chris is sitting in front of Hatchet, Barry behind Chris.\n\nHATCHET\n\nWant a drink?\n\nBARRY\nHello son, would you like a lolly?\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\n\nPiss off you nonce!\n\nBIG CHRIS\n\nOi, watch it! No thanks Harry, we are both all right. Nice shooter.\n\nHATCHET\nLike it? One of a pair, Holland and Holland. Here, you want to hold it?\n\nBIG CHRIS\n\nNah, not my thing, thank you, Harry. Business good? I imagine that's \nwhat I am here for.\n\nHarry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat, does \na breast-stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris, \ntakes a big breath of air and begins.\n\nHATCHET\n\nI want you to forget about any other debts at the moment; there are \nfresher fish to fry!\n\nBIG CHRIS\n\nGo on.\n\nHATCHET\n\nIt's a bit of a priority. Four young fellas who got in deeper than they \ncould handle; they owe me half a million pounds.\n\n68 ~ 69\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\n\nHow much?\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nTom, BACON\nand Soap are sitting in front of Ed who looks as though he is about to \nlaunch in to a speech.\n\nTOM\nWhat's the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDY\n\nI hope I won't need to. I got a plan. So listen carefully.\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT WINSTON\n\nLook, he set us up. That means he put money into us, which means he \nexpects money out of us. You don't need to be an economist to work that \nout.\n\nJ\nHe might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit, but he can't \nhave any idea about the hard currency we've accumulated. We can just \nslice it off the top.\n\nWINSTON\nYou guys, you've got to realise who this chap is. He's a fucking \nlunatic. If he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing \nstraight dice, you - and fuck it, me - are going to know what the sharp \nside of a kebab knife feels like.\n\n*CHARLES Come on, we are in this for the cash however it comes.\n\nThe phone rings. Winston picks it up.\n\n* Cut from completed film.\n\n70\n\nWINSTON\nHello.\n\nDAISY \n(she is upset) \nWinston?\n\nWINSTON\nYeah.\n\nDAISY \nIt's Daisy.\n\nWINSTON\nI know who it is. What's the problem?\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe situation has been explained. There are thoughtful frowns on all \nforeheads. There is a pause.\n\nSOAP\nWell, what do you want us to do about it?\n\nEDDY\nHit the fuckers.\n\nPause while this is digested.\n\nI know it sounds a bit heavy, but it's not like you are doing anything \nillegal.\n\nBACON\nI don't know how you've reached that conclusion.\n\nEDDY\nThey can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can \nthey?\n\n71\n\nTOM\nHow heavy are the fellas anyway?\n\nEDDY\n\nThey don't look all that.\n\nSOAP\n\nHitler didn't look all that.\n\nEDDY\nAll right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the \nsilver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. \nIt's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig?\n\nSilence falls over them.]\n\nBACON\n\nI am game.\n\nTOM\n\nMe too.\n\nS0AP\n\nOh, god!\n\nEDDY\nWell, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and \nprepared for them.\n\nPause as Ed's voice drops a little. And they are armed.\n\nSOAP\nWhat was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?\n\nEDDY\nEr, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do \nyou think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!\n\nSOAP\nGuns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the \nsafest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . \n.\n\nEDDY\nJesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...\n\nSOAP\n\nAnd what exactly?\n\nEDDY\nAnd we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.\n\nSOAP\nCarrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.\n\nEDDY\nNo, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume \nhe will still\n\nbe carrying when he comes back from the job.\n\nSOAP\nOh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the \nbrother of all fuck-ups?\n\nTOM\nIt's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!\n\nSOAP\nWell, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any \ndifference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking \nbullets!\n\n72 ~ 73\n\nEDDY\n\nSoap, if you got a better idea to get five hundred grand in the next \nfew days you let us know . . . In the meantime, Tom, speak to Nick the \nBubble about moving the weed.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nTom and Nick are stuck away in a corner playing on a fruit machine.\n\nNICK\n\nWeed?\n\nTOM\nNot normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think \nlet alone move shit.\n\nNICK\nDoesn't sound very good to me.\n\nTOM\nNeither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's \non and burning bright for the masses.\n\nNICK\n\nYou'll need samples, Tom.\n\nTOM\n\nNo can do.\n\nNICK\n\nWhere's that? A place near Katmandu? Meet me half way, mate.\n\nTOM\nListen, it's all completely chicken soup.\n\nNICK\n\nIt's what?\n\n.\n\nTOM\n\nKosher as Christmas\n\nNICK\n(rolls his eyes)\nJews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.\n\nTOM\nNever mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of \nsawn-off shotguns.\n\nNICK\nBloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' \nWho do you think I am?\n\nTOM\nI think you're Nick the Greek.\n\nINT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nThere's a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room. We \nmeet Rory Breaker. Rory is a very well-dressed cool-looking black dude. \nHe is in his own way sophisticated, considering what he does for a \nliving. His help, however, are less well-informed. Rory has Nick the \nGreek in front of him.\n\nRORY\nNick, I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is \nwhat he says it is, I'll give him three and a half thousand a key, \nthat's if it is what he says it is. I don't want to see it after a \nsample, I don't want to touch it after a sample. I'll leave you in the \ncapable hands of Nathan here. He will work out the details, but let me \nget this straight. If the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind \nof pussy who will drink it. Know what I mean?\n\n74 ~ 75\n\nINT. GARAGE UNDER THE ARCHES - DAY\n\nThe Scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job \nto Barry and assistant. Dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to \ndisguise his accident with the butler. Barry raises his eyebrows at \nthis new look.\n\nBARRY\nIs your hair supposed to look like that, then?\n\nGary ignores this question.\n\nDEAN\nNext time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are \ngoing back to post offices and cars.\n\nBARRY\nWhere're the others?\n\nBarry is looking with same concern for the hammer-lock Purdeys.\n\nDEAN\nThere are no others.\n\nBARRY\nNow, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?\n\nDEAN\nI don't know what you mean.\n\nBARRY\n(dead serious)\nThere were two old guns there; where are they?\n\nDEAN\nNot in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock \nmuskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!\n\n77\n\nBARRY\nWell you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.\n\nDEAN\nThey were . . .\n\nBARRY\n(interrupts)\nI am not fucking interested.\n\nShouting. If you don't want to end up counting the fingers that you \nhaven't got, or sharing a bed with the anti-Christ, I suggest you get \nthose guns, quick.\n\nINT. BACK OF VAN - DAY\n\nWe are facing Nick's large behind, builder's cleavage poking out of the \ntop of his trousers. Nick is unwrapping two long implements from a \nsheet: the hammer-lock Purdeys.\n\nTOM\nJesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you \nget them from?\n\nNICK\nI got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself \nor do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired \neffect.\n\nTOM\nThey look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, \naren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these \nmuskets?\n\nNICK\nSeven hundred each.\n\n78\n\nTOM\nWhat's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know \nthey're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause.\n\nAnd they're a bit long, aren't they?\n\nNICK\nSawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.\n\nTOM\nRange? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but \nI don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look \nfucking mean.\n\nNICK\nOf course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.\n\nTOM\nAll right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your \nweed man?\n\nNICK\nRory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy \nboy.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nWe are looking directly at JD's shell-shocked face. He gently lays down \nan empty glass on the bar.\n\nHATCHET\nI understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but I'll tell you \nhow this can be resolved by the good father.\n\n* Big Chris in completed film.\n\nPause. The camera spins round to reveal Hatchet and Barry the Baptist.\n\nJD\nGo on.\n\nHATCHET\nI like your bar.\n\nJD\nYes?\n\nHATCHET\nI want your bar.\n\nJD\nAnd?\n\nHATCHET\nDo you want me to draw a picture?\n\nJD\nHarry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you \nfrom a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.\n\nHATCHET\nWhat, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of \nbeing able to sustain your son's life.\n\nJD\nAnd you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But \nnot to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!\n\nBarry pulls a kind of mock-scared face and clutches his heart.\n\n80\n\nHATCHET\nOh, careful JD, you'll give Barry a heart-attack.\n\nWe crash-zoom again into Harry's eyes to see the pupils contract. It's \ntime to look mean.\n\nI'll put that down to shock, but only once, only once can or will I let \nyou get away with that. Your son's still got three days to find half a \nmillion, but make up your mind which one you prefer: your son, or your \nbar.\n\nWe have a slow-motion close-up of the drink being slammed down, proving \na point.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nBACON has rigged up an amplifier to the hole in the cupboard along with \na ridiculous amount of recording equipment. The house lights still \nflicker on and off. We start the first part of the conversation looking \nat Bacon, who has his headphones on. We cut to Dog halfway through the \nsecond sentence.\n\nINT. DOG'S HDUSE - DAY\n\nPLANK\nThere's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.\n\nDOG\nThere is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this \nis going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's \nnot going to be easy.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nBACON has a kettle next to where he is sitting. It steams away quite \nhappily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket. BACON \nprepares himself.- BOOM! He disappears into black.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThey react to the BOOM! Dog looks at the wall with suspicion, misses a \nbeat, then continues.\n\nDOG\nWhat's that idiot doing next door?\n(Points at Paul)\nWe use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out \nlike balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but \nit is never locked, is it Plank?\n\nPLANK\nNo.\n\nDOG\nAnd it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the \nrest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, \nscare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but \nthey might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When \nthe job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, \nunload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?\n\nALL TOGETHER\nYup.\n\nDOG\nRight, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it. Apparently these stags \ndon't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's \nhow I like it.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nBACON is now lit by candle.\n\nBACON\nJesus.\n\nDOG\n(off)\nSo no messing around tonight. We leave eight a.m., OK?\n\nEDDY\nYes?\n\nBACON\nIt's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSOAP\n(staggering)\nWhere did you get those from, a museum?\n\nTOM\nNick the Greek.\n\nBACON\nHow much did you part with?\n\nTOM\nSeven hundred for the pair.\n\nSOAP\nDrachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They \ncould do more harm than good.\n\nBACON\nJesus, Tom, do they work?\n\nTOM\nI dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.\n\nEDDY\nTop of the list of priorities, how nice they look.\n\nSOAP\nLadies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only \ngot two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good \nplace to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in \nthe box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick \ntheir van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here. \nAs long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last \nthing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them \naround a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt \nany one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think \nknives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones \nthat look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because \nthey don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to \nuse them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros.\n\nThere is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion.\n\nTOM\nIs there something we should know about you, Soap?\n\nBACON\nI am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\nEd and Bacon, etc, are all mounted up on top of one another looking out \na crack in the curtain. They are observing Dog's party en route to \nwork. They are dressed as kebab shop assistants.\n\nSOAP\nWhere the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a \nrobbery.\n\nEDDY\nWhere did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, \nTom?\n\nTOM\nWell, not exactly like that.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE (VAN) - MORNING\n\nDog and troop load up.\n\nINT. SLDANES' SITTING ROOM - MORNING\n\nCut to Sloanes. They are up and unusually awake. Today is the day to \nmove the money so they are comparatively alert. There is lots of \nactivity.\n\nWINSTON\nYou fucking jelly-heads, move it. You have been up for two hours, you \nshould have got somewhere by now. The gear and the money has got to be \nout of here before twelve.\n\nThe horn blasts.\n\nWho's that? J, don't you dare open the door until you use that cage. I \nam serious, and find out who it is first.\n\n86\n\nINT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY\n\nJ\n(raising his voice for the door)\nHello, can I help you?\n\nPLANK\nAll right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?\n\nJ\nNo, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.\n\nPLANK\nWell, perhaps you can help?\n\nJ\nWell, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.\n\nPLANK\nLook, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?\n\nJ\nI can't help you, Plank.\n\nPLANK\nI think you'll find it is in your interest.\n\nINT SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\nJ\nHold on. OK.\n(Whispering inside.)\nLook Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our \ninterest.\n\n87\n\nWINSTON\nI don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not \ntoday.\n\nWILLIAM\nHold on: we are in business and correct me if I am wrong, but that is \nbusiness?\n\nJ\nCorrected; that's a walking accident that we can do without.\n\nWILLIAM Jesus, he's OK; he knows only to buy weights now, so we are \nlooking at least a couple of thou; just one last time.\n\nJ\nWhat do you think, Winston?\n\nPause.\n\nWINSTON\nWilly, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, \notherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have \nwork to do.\n\nEXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY\n\nDOG\n(frustrated)\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\nMICK\nDo you want me to have a look, Dog?\n\nDOG\nNo, you silly fucker, stay still.\n(Whispering)\nWhat's going on?\n\nPLANK\nCome on, I can't wait out here all day.\n\nStarting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks \ndown the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance.\n\nJ\n(off)\nAll right, just coming.\n\nJ unlocks the door after getting the cage ready. There's an external \ndoor, and then a small corridor before the cage. J is inside the cage. \nTwo, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they \nwould be poking out on the outside world.\n\nINT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY\n\nPLANK\nI thought you were going to leave me out there all day.\n\nJ\nI didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.\n\nPLANK\n(taking the piss)\nLives and learns doesn't one.\n\nThen devastation slaps him hard.\n\nKeep the gates locked now, do you?\n\nJ\nSorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these \ndays.\n\nPLANK\nI know.\n(Suddenly turning very nasty whispering.)\nNow shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word \nthen your left.\n\nJ\n(confused and believing it's a joke, until he sees the gun.)\nWhat are you doing, Plank?\n\nPLANK\nWhat do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that \ngate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.\n\nJ has found it all too much and has passed out with fear, collapsing on \nthe floor in an awkward contorted position. Plank is desperately trying \nto find the right key. Things are not going as well as planned. Dog, in \nthe meantime, has decided it's time to start the show\n\nEXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY\n\nDOG\n Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two.\n\nThey all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into \nPlank. The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage. \nPlank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve \nthem. Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also \nstill exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between \nthe outside door and the inside cage.\n\n90 ~ 91\n\nINT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY\n\nDOG\n(mesmerized}\nThe fucking gate's shut, you prick.\n\nPLANK\nJust hold on, I got the keys.\n\nHaving clawed them back with the end of his shotgun.\n\nDOG\n(seeing an unconscious man at his feet)\nWhat the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?\n\nPLANK\n(fumbling and panicking)\nI didn't touch him, he just passed out.\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\nWINSTON\nJ, what's going on out there?\n(Realising)\nGet the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.\n\nINT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY\n\nDOG\nGet the sodding gate open now, Plank.\n\nPlank is busy fumbling about, not really getting anywhere because of \nthe pressure being applied.\n\nPLANK\n(trying to convince himself, as much as Dog)\nIt must be this one.\n\nDOG\nJust give me the keys.\n\nThe gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at \nDog's groin.\n\nPoint your gun in there, dick, not at me.\n\nMick has unwrapped his gun from his case. Dog turns and looks amazed at \nthe size of the weapon.\n\nWhat the fuck is that?\n\nMICK\nIt's a bren gun.\n\nDOG\nYou could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't \nya?\n\nPop! We hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars.\n\nPLANK\n(trying to salvage some credibility)\nDon't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.\n\nDOG\n(amazed by this stupidity)\nWho are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.\n\nWe hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck. This \nunderstarulably sends him into a real panic, thinking this is curtains.\n\nPLANK\n(gurgle)\nThey shot me!\n\nPanic unashamedly exposing itself. Trickles of blood start flowing from \nin-between Plank's fingers.\n\nDOG\n(unimpressed)\nWell shoot them.\n\nPlank shoots at everything and nothing. Smoke fills the corridor, \nleaving them in a cloud. A bit of coughing goes on, then silence.\n\nJOHN\nJesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges, I can't see a \nbloody thing.\n\nPop! Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest.\n\nAh, Jesus, shit, I've been shot!\n\nDOG\nI don't fucking believe this. Could everybody stop getting shot. Sit \ndown John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle.\n\nDog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire. Dog \nand the boys panic, cover their ears and hit the floor. After this \noutburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit. Mick looks \ndown at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog; he doesn't get it.\n\nWhat the fuck was that?\n\nMICK\nThat was the bren gun!\n\n94 . ~ 95\n\nDOG\nIf you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand?\n\nHe speaks softly but he is quite shaken. He then raises his voice; he \nhas had enough of all this mincing.\n\nRight fellas!\n\nHe shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of J up \nto use as a shield.\n\nBefore I go any further I am going to shoot your mate's toes off!\n\nNo sooner said than done; his toes go. The smoke problem repeats itself \nand J faints again, but an unfazed Dog continues.\n\nNow if you want us to be gone in two minutes, open the fucking gate, \nnow!\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\nCHARLES\nHe'll probably kill us if we do.\n\nWINSTON\nWell, J will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious. Look what he \ndid to his toes.\n\nDOG\n(off)\nRight, his leg's going now.\n\nWINSTON\nAll right, all fucking right, I am coming.\n(Turning and whispering)\nWillie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.\n\nWillie slinks off with a `like what?' look on his face.\n\nINT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY\n\nDOG\nAnd all your friends, there's a good lad.\n\nWINSTON\nThere is only three of us here.\n\nDOG\nDo you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?\n\nWINSTON\nI mean it, there is only three of us here.\n\nDOG\nPlank?\n\nPLANK\n(gurgle, gurgle)\nYeah, one of them's out.\n\nDOG\nOK, open the gate.\n\nNo sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead \nwith the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG\n\nUp boy, up, up.\n\nThey reach the top of the stairs.\n\nTie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money?\n\nPLANK\nThere, in those shoe boxes.\n\nDog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank \nwould be pushing up daisies.\n\nDOG\n(gun to the head of Winston)\nWhere?\n\nWINSTON\nOut the back.\n\nDOG\nAnd the weed?\n\nWINSTON\nOut the back.\n\nMICK\nPoint.\n\nWINSTON\nWith what?\n\nMICK\nYour hands, now!\n\nWINSTON\nI can't, I am tied up.\n\n98\n\nMICK\nWell, well, shake your head or something.\n\nDOG\nAll right Plank, get Paul out of the van.\n\nThis is done on a walky talky.\n\nINT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY\n\nThe door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He \nturns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight \ninto Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger \nas he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming \nuncontrollably\n\nDOG\n(to Plank)\nGive us your knife.\n\nDog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to \nits source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and \nslumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand.\n\n(the point of the blade resting on William's throat)\nEnough! Mick, how you doing?\n\nMICK\nHow do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.\n\nDog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly \npacked and stacked.\n\nPAUL (in doorway visibly shocked\nGordon Bennett! What's been going on in here?\n\nDOG\nShut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?\n\nPAUL\nThere's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get \nthis all in the van.\n\nDOG\nBollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.\n\nEXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY\n\nA traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nYou got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will \nmove it for you.\n\nPAUL\nI'll only be a minute.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nYou've already been fifteen.\n\nPaul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are \nnecessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the \nstreet: the coast is clear.\n\nPAUL\nLook. Go on, look.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nAt what, exactly?\n\nPAUL\nMy van is half full.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nSo?\n\nPAUL\nSo I've just got to put you in, and I am off.\n\nHaving made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back \ndoors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The \nmomentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another \nquick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper \ninto the vehicle.\n\nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\nPLANK\nMy neck, Dog.\n(Dog shows no sign of pity)\nThat's the last bag?\n\nDOG\n(Turning to Mick.)\nHow about you? All right?\n\nMICK\nI'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the \nmachete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.\n\nDOG\nDo it quietly.\n\nGloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and \ntroop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising \nthe gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the \nsure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away \nfrom her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body \nof Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat. \nGloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, \nknew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover \nand Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best. \nEventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, \ngoes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes \ncautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes. \nDog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her \non the jaw Gloria is knocked out.\n\nWhat was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up. \nWe are getting out of here.\n\nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nBACON\nEh, bunk us up over the wall.\n\nBACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the \nothers over. They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nEDDY\nEverything all right out there, Tom?\n\nTOM\n(on phone)\nRight as rain.\n\nEDDY\nWhere the hell are we supposed to hide?\n\nEd looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover. He \nshrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea.\n\nSOAP\nWhat are you doing, Ed?\n\nEDDY\n\nDo you want one?\n\nSOAP\nNo I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.\n\nEDDY\nWhy not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.\n\nSOAP\nAnd look what happened to that.\n\nEDDY\nIf you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.\n\nINT. DOG'S VAN - DAY\n\nDog turns to admire a full van.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nYou won't get away with it.\n\nDog turns around and sees the tragic warden.\n\nDOG\nPaul, what's that?\n\nPAUL\nThat's a traffic warden.\n\nDOG\n(looking straight at Paul)\nWhat's he doing in the van?\n\nDog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly\n\nPAUL\nHe was about to call the cozzers.\n\nPaul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness.\n\nDOG\nWe will deal with him later.\n\nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY Tom is on the mobile phone.\n\nTOM\nThey're here.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and \nis met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing \nhis chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts. \nIt's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump \nout of their positions.\n\nBACON\nDown, down, get fucking down now'\n\nThis is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem \nnot to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his \ngun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the \nfloor immediately.\n\nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nPaul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is \nmet by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead \npipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged \nin screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly\n\nEDDY\nTie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.\n\nDOG\nI'll find you.\n\nBACON\nOf course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the \nkeys without any trouble.\n\nEDDY\nI'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.\n\nINT. DOG'S VAN - DAY\n\nThere is silence.

Look, what's this?\n\nHe holds up the hat.\n\nTOM\nShit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.\n\nPause.\n\nBACON\nI think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. \nWhat did they want with a traffic warden?\n\nEDDY\nI dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nHATCHET\nIt's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris.

RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nNick has given the weed to Rory for inspection. Lenny has stepped in.\n\nLENNY\nIt is skunk . . . and it's as good as it gets.\n\nRORY\nOK, I'll take it off you; half price.\n\nNICK\nI don't think he'll like that. You said three-five a key, that's what \nhe wants and you know that's a good price.\n\nRORY BREAKER\nIt was yesterday I said three and a half grand and today is today, if I \nam not mistaken.\n\nTurns back to the TV.\n\nI'll take it tomorrow for half price. If he wants to move it quick \nhe'll take it. Now, I've got another game coming up in a minute so if \nyou would be kind enough.\n\nPointing at the door. Nick exits.\n\nLenny, take this to Snow White and the three little chemists; they \nshould have a gander at this. I want a proper opinion. 110\n\nEXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nLenny and Nathan, Rory's minders, pull up outside the Sloanes' house to \nhave the weed analysed. For the first time it is revealed that Rory \nBreaker owns the Sloanes.\n\nLENNY\nHold on!\n\nNATHAN\nWhat?\n\nLENNY\nsomething's not quite right here. Go in slowly, Nathan.\n\nNATHAN\nFuck you funny man, you go first.\n\nINT.

RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nWe see Winston, Nathan and the torso of Lenny, standing in front of \nRory Like naughty schoolchildren.\n\nWINSTON\nWe had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through. Poor bloody J got \nshot; it was a right mess.\n\nThe gravity and reality dawns on Rory.\n\nRORY\nIt will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me.\n\nLENNY\nSome girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess.\n\nWINSTON\n(proudly j\nWe shot one of them in the throat.\n\n112\n\nRORY\nWhat do you want, a fucking medal? I'll shoot you in the fucking throat \nif I don't get the gear back.\n\nHe pauses, rubs his forehead and continues, slightly calmer. You shot \nthe one that's in there now?\n\nWINSTON\n\nNo, another one.\n\nRORY\nThis is more like it. So where's he?\n\nWINSTON\nThey took him with them; he was still alive.\n\nRORY\nWell, what did you shoot him with, an air gun?\n\nThere is an embarrassed pause and a look of `how did you know?' Rory \ndoesn't need an answer and slaps his forehead.\n\nWINSTON\nWe grow weed, we're not mercenaries.\n\nRORY\n\nYou don't say.\n\nThere is a pause while Rory searches for the right words. The silence \nis deafening.\n\nLENNY\n(stupidly)\nWho could it be? Where do we start, Rory?\n\nRory looks up amazed.\n\nRORY\nMr Breaker! Today my name is Mr Breaker. You think_this is a \ncoincidence? Not many, Benny! This white shite steals my goods and then \nthinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me. They got less brains \nthan you, Lenny . . . Get Nick cum-bubble round here now if he is \nstupid enough to still be on this planet.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDog has all his boys round.\n\nDOG\nI want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.\n\nJOHN\nWhat is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken \nit with 'em.\n\nDOG\nIt is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and \nthat is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you \nto get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. \nI want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you \nresponsible.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nAll kinds of characters have made an appearance. A game of cards is in \nmotion, the forfeit now being alcohol. Barfly Jack the barman is \nsitting at the table. They are already on the road to being comfortably \ncomatose.\n\nTOM\nRory Breaker?\n\n114\n\nBARFLY JACK\nYeah, I know Rory.\n\nThis next section is subtitled. This is to keep everyone, even those \nfamiliar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration, of \nwhich even Tom is unsure. As with the police scene earlier this is a \nvoice-over and we cut to the relevant scenes.\n\nBARFLYJACK\n(voice-over)\nRory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey \nand kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist. \nA few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the \nbattle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching \nthe custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens \nand he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it \nsomewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to \nmiss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a \nfire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are \nready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then \norders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and \nswitches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory \ngobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match \ninto his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, \nunfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos \nran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won \ntoo, four-nil.\n\nEXT.JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nAfter a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to \npursue her, running out on to the street. Daisy is nowhere to be seen.\n\n115\n\nINT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nNick is blissfully ignorant of the situation. He is sitting in front of \nRory.\n\nRORY\nYour one saving grace might be your stupidity.\n\nNICK\n(looking quite petrified)\nEr.\n\nRORY\nDon't fucking er me, Greek boy! How is it that your so-fucking-stupid, \nsoon-to-be-dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear? \nAnd then sell it back to me? Is this a declaration of war? Is this some \nsort of white cunts' joke that black cunts don't get? 'Cos I am not \nfucking laughing, Nik-ol-as.\n\nNICK\nEr.\n\nRORY\nThere are four interests I have, Nick. Football, music, money, and the \nannihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist . . . I know \nyou couldn't have known my position because you're not so fucking \nstupid that if you did know, you would turn up here scratching your \narse, with that `what's going on here' look slapped on your Chevy \nChase. But what you do know is where these people live.\n\nWe look at the white faced Nick. He doesn't open his mouth. The penny \nhas dropped.\n\nIf you hold anything back, I'll kill you. If you bend the truth, or if \nI think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you. If you forget \nanything, I'll kill you. In fact, you're going to have to work very \nhard to stay alive, Nick. I hope you understand everything\n\nI have said. Because if you don't, I'll kill you. Now, Mr Bubble and \nSqueak. You may now enlighten me.\n\nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\nPaul, John, and Plank are lined up like naughty schoolchildren in front \nof Dog, who is black-eyed and pissed off:\n\nDOG\nSo we have a bit of a problem, don't we?\n\nJOHN\nEr well, yes we do.\n\nDOG\nIn fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You \ncould say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking \nEverest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a \nmon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first \nfucking idea who did this to us, do you?\n\nPLANK\nDog, we have been up all night. It's no one round here! We have had \nthem all against the wall.\n\nJOHN\nIf it was a toe rag from the area we would know.\n\nDog starts slapping his troops round their heads.\n\nDOG\nYou wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you \nprick! You find 'em, you hear? And find 'em quick! Now get out and \nstart looking! Out! Out!\n\nDog Loses his temper and throws Plank across the room. Plank's head \nbreaks effortlessIy through the wall.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S CUPBOARD - MORNING\n\nA dust-covered Plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of \nrecording equipment.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY\n\nRecovering from the night before.\n\nBACON\nScarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug \ndeal, you watch Scarface!\n\nEDDY\nThat inspires confidence, that does.\n\nTOM\nThis guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are \nselling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a \npain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?\n\nSOAP\nI would take a pain in the arse for half a million.\n\nTOM\nYou would take a pain ? the arse full stop.\n\nSOAP\nTom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.\n\nEDDY\nJesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay \nHatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not \nbad for a day's work, I think you will agree.\n\n118\n\nINT. SPLTT SCREEN. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nA seventies-style split screen. A very shaky Nick answers his cartoon \ntelephone.\n\nNICK\nYeah?\n\nINT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDEAN\nThat's no way to answer the phone.\n\nNICK\nIs that you, Dean?\n\nDEAN\nSure is.\n\nNICK\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nDEAN\nYou know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.\n\nNICK\nNot likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.\n\nDEAN\nI got the money to pay for 'em.\n\nNICK\nI am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to \nsee them or the guns again.\n\nGary looks at Dean.\n\n119\n\nDEAN\nIf we can't get 'em, we can't get 'em.\n\nINT.

Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a-\nHatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?\n\nDean pauses for a while, a look of concern coming over his face.\n\nWell this is `James Bond need to know' time. They're his! When you \ndance with the devil you wait for the song to stop, know what I mean?\n\nHatchet has had enough. He grabs the phone from Barry's hand, waving \nthe infamous fifteen-inch big black cock in the other hand. Hatchet \ngoes on to put the shits up the Scousers.\n\nHATCHET\nDo you know who I am? I am split in two; there is me, and there is my \npatience, and patience has gone to the hospital; you are not far \nbehind, know what I mean? I mean, find ' em, torture 'em, kill 'em, and \nbring back what belongs to me, because if you don't . . . you are . . . \nbang . . . in trouble.\n\nHatchet slams the phone down. Dean looks at Gary in horror.\n\nGARY\nWho was that?\n\nDEAN\nThat was Hatchet Horrible Harry.\n\nGARY\nJesus, I have heard about him.\n\nDEAN\nWe're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta \nfind 'em.\n\nDean dials Nick immediately.\n\nNo fucking about, Nick; where can I find those guns?\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDog and boys have made a Large hole in the connecting cupboard wall \nwhich they have crawled through. Dog is holding a large bag which he \nhas found.\n\nJOHN\nDog, I have found the cash!\n\nDOG\nThe stupid bastards! Count it!\n\nJOHN\nShit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?\n\nDOG\nWe're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. \nCount it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that \nmoney as soon as they walk in.\n\nJOHN\nBut...\n(interrupts)\nGive it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait \nuntil they are well in, then give it to 'em.\n\nINT RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nRory Breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to Ed's.\n\nRORY BREAKER\nWe are going to do a proper decoration job. I want the grey skies of \nLondon illuminated; I want that house painted red. Winston here is \ncoming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's \nmine back here. Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of \narsenal and they don't mind using it. Now you know what you're doing, \nyes?\n\nEXT.

Dog is counting out the money in the side room and \nhas the two antique hammer-lock shotguns resting on the table in front \nof him, which were found with the rest of the bounty.\n\nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nRory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door. \nThe rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with \ngun) prepares to do his worst.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThere is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a \nlarge black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be \nat home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as \nboth gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the \nmachine gun to explore further.\n\nPLANK\n(under his breath)\nWhat the fuck is going on here?\n\nDog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into \ntheir own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use \nthem. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see \nnumerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't \ntake any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.'\n\nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nWe see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY\n\nDog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than \naware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his \nsuitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, \ngets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then \nchecks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks \nquite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and \nis holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit.\n\nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nBig Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the \nactivity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks \nstraight into him.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nGot something here for me, have ya?\n(Dog is stunned by this)\nCome on, chop chop.\n\nBefore Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each \nhand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing \nwhat day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of \nmoney, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much.\n\nOn reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on \nthe back seat.\n\nCount that son, and put your seatbelt on.\n\nINT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY\n\nDEAN\nFollow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns.\n\nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nEd's place has been shot to pieces.

The opportunity was there. In my \nexperience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.\n\nHATCHET\nGood job, Chris.\n\nChris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet.

He loads \nand plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds.\n\nThe door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a \nScouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying \nthrough his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the \ndecision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is \nhe holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the \ndoorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, \nholding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair \nare blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry \nhas effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually \nshattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers. \nThere is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective \ntargets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is \nairborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's \nbullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to \nstop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past \nhim.\n\nOvertaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and \nproceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed. Hatchet flies over \nhis desk. Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last \nbullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk. It is \nthen revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door. The \nScourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face. Barry throws \nthe hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block. It hits \nGary in the back. Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in \nBarry's stomach. It is then clear to them both that this has all been a \nterrible mistake.\n\nBARRY/GARY\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nThen both collapse into dead lumps on the floor.\n\nEXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE ED'S CAR - DAY\n\nEDDY\nYou and me, Tom.\n\nTOM\nWhat do you mean, me?\n\nThey stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when \nTom notices it's open.\n\nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY EDDY\n\nOh Jesus, not again.\n\nThe two pause while they build their confidence. They enter Hatchet \nHarry's room. It's still smoky. There on the table is the money.\n\nTOM\nThat's it, I am off.\n\nEd tiptoes over to the bag containing the money.\n\nEDDY\nTom, this is our case.\n\nTOM\n. . . What?\n\nEDDY\nThis is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.\n\nTom sees his guns. His eyes widen in surprise.\n\nTOM\nI'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.\n\n136\n\nEDDY\nTom, don't mess around, let's go.\n\nTOM\nI'11 meet you in the car.\n\nEDDY\nTom?\n\nTOM\nI'll only be a minute.\n\nEXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE/CHRIS'S CAR - DAY\n\nBIG CHRIS\nA job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.\n\nAs he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little \nboy\n\nBIG CHRIS\nSon?\n\nDOG\nMade a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?\n\nWe can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along \nthe front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back. \nBig Chris assesses the situation.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nYou all right back there, mate?\n\nDOG\nVery fucking funny. Where's what I want?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nIt's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137\n\nDOG\nWell, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want \nto see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nAll right, furry muff.\n\nBig Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and \nstarts the car.\n\nDOG\nWhat are you doing?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nWell, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.\n\nDOG\nYou had better be careful.\n\nBig Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little \nChris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets \nfaster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. \nChris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. \nBANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.\n\nINT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nAnother time lapse.\n\nSOAP\nWell, what's going on?\n\nEDDY\nI don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which \nmeans there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more \nproblem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they \nare all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything \nwrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.\n\nBang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash \ngoes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked \nunconscious.\n\nINT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY\n\nBig Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to \nsmash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing \nso.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nNever, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to \nme as you have.\n\nDog is being thrown around like a rag doll.\n\nINT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE\n\nWe are looking through a two-way mirror.\n\nSERG\nDon't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need \nto know what's going on, Edward.\n\nEDDY\nIf you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.\n\nThe camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a \npoliceman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he \nshakes his head.\n\nTRAFFIC WARDEN\nNo, that's not one of them.\n\nThe policeman then knocks on the door.\n\nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\n\nThe SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on \nhis own. After a short pause the door bursts open.\n\nSERG\nAll right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here.\n\nFADE IN TO BLACK.\n\nFADE IN.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nAll the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is \ninterested in whatever he has to say.\n\nEDDY\nThe traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so \nthat put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because \nthere is no evidence against us.\n\nBACON\nApart from those shotguns.\n\nEDDY\nAnd Tom took care of them.\n\nPause while Tom looks embarrassed about something.\n\nSOAP\nYou did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?\n\nEd looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed.\n\nTOM\nI wanted to talk to you about that.\n\nBACON\nWell, talk.\n\nTOM\nWell not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought \nwe might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a \nproblem getting hold of him.\n\nBACON\n\nYou dippy bastard.\n\nEDDY\nThe only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car \nwhich is sitting outside?\n\nTOM\nWe paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them \nto you, could they?\n\nSOAP\nI don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.\n\nEDDY\nTom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.\n\nBACON\nAnd, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP\n\nNow, Tom! There is a pause.\n\nALTOGETHER\nNow, Tom!\n\nTom leaves, looking a little sulky.\n\nEDDY\nThe silly sod.\n\nBig Chris walks in. He approaches the bar.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nJD.\n\nJD\nChris.\n(Pause)\nYou come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nNope.\n\nJD\nCan I help?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nI think I can help you, as it happens.\n\nJD\nYes?\n\nBIG CHRIS\nI have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.\n\nJD\nWell, I suggest you speak to him, then.\n\nThey all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it \non the table, which increases the shock factor.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nIt seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have \ncost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have \ndecided to bring your bag back.\n\nPause. The words you are looking for start with thank you.\n\nEDDY\nThank you.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nNow you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any \nmore. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that \nis unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be \nwaving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last \nlittle visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been \nemotional.\n\nBig Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each \nother.\n\nEXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nBig Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car. \nLittle Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nThat should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-\nloaning business, all right, son?\n\nLITTLE CHRIS\nAll right, Dad.\n\nBIG CHRIS\nWell, put your seatbelt on then.\n\nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nEd goes forward to open the case. The rest are still in shock. Ed opens \nthe bag.\n\nEDDY\nThere's nothing in it!\n\nSOAP\nWhat do you mean?\n\nEDDY\nI mean it's fucking empty.\n\nBACON  lunges forward and stares in. He sticks his hand in and extracts \nan A4 envelope. They look puzzled. Ed feels the package and starts to \ntear the top off. As this is done it creates a split screen.\n\nOn the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the \ncar boot open. He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last \npolish. Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail. \nSimultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns. They \nstill look confused. They turn the brochure upside down and recognize \nthe shotguns. Slowly they start to turn the pages.\n\nTorn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall. He starts \nwalking but stops for some reason. He retreads his steps and peers \nover; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf.\n\nEd sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between \neyes and prices. They panic and reach for their mobile phones.\n\nTom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with \none arm.\n\nEd starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and \nasks them to put their phones down.\n\nTom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail. His mobile phone \nstarts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let \ngo of the rail to answer the phone.\n\nThe shot freezes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Guy Ritchie\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:02.054559"}
