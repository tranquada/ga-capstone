Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang\nin a velvet void. The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind.\n\nThe light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet. We see ragged\ncontinents and oceans wreathed in cloud. This is earth rise. Our world\nspins slowly in space, a thing of beauty, of awesome majesty. In all this\nnothingness - life.\n\nWe push in on the planet - in to the Americas. The wind grows louder -\n\nA PUEBLO VILLAGE.\n\nA broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe\nhouses, blinding flurries of dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a\ncrumbling church. A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is\nthe DOCTOR. '\n\nA WOMAN'S FACE.\n\nScreaming. She's very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed in a\ncorner of one of the houses. She is in the final throes of childbirth, a\nsheet draped over her loins. The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging\nher in Spanish.\n\nThe local PRIEST, not long out of the seminary, crouches at her side\ncounting off the beads of a rosary. He looks like he is about to pass out.\n\nSUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES\nDOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD\n-\n\nDOCTOR\n\nArriva!\n\nHe lifts the child from her loins, but it makes no sound. We don't see the\nbaby - just the shock on the Doctor's face. The mother struggles up to see\nher child.\n\nThe Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it. He\nthrusts the bundle into the Priest's hands.\n\nDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\n(in Spanish)\n\nDead - the child is dead. Now go!\n\nWe hold on the mother's anguished face. Dissolve to\n\nA HELICOPTER\n\nOff the roof of a tall hospital building. As it rises up into the night we\nsee a red cross painted on its side. It's an air ambulance.\n\nThe chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, every skyscraper a blaze of\nlights, opens up behind it. The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and\ninto the night.\n\nGROVE OF TREES\n\nWinter's coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold. The\nhelicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately\ntended lawn. Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great\nuniversity. Harvard.\n\nTwo paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a\nstainless steel casket onto a gurney. They wheel it fast towards one of the\nbuildings. As they go' through the front doors, we hold on a sign etched\ninto the stone\n\nDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY\n\nA PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS\n\nslide a long cylindrical \"key\" into the stainless steel casket. We pull\nback to reveal the casket lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of\npeople in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass\nwalls.\n\nA young TECHNICIAN, working at a console, keyboards in a series of\ncommands.\n\nSswhish. The top of the steel casket swings open. Clouds of white gas\nstream out -whatever's inside has been nitrogen cooled.\n\nThe gas clears. Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that\nthe baby has the skin, the face and the features of a man of eighty. The\nscientists and the researchers react - shocked.\n\nOne of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby. In its fingers it\nholds a long steel scalpel. This is the highest-tech autopsy you've ever\nseen. The scalpel drives down, about to open the chest cavity -\n\nBLOOD SPRAYS\n\nBut not from the baby's chest - it's in glass vials, exploding as white-hot\nflames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against\nthe flames, is emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door\nshut.\n\nHe turns we see his face. He's in his 4Os, handsome in a rough-hewn way - a\nstrong jaw and a muscular body. There's a cool intelligence in his eyes,\nbut a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who,\nbetween youth and middle-age, lost his way. And so he has. His name is WILL\nROBINSON.\n\nHe takes a steel trolley, wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of\nsight.\n\nCLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN\n\nfeatures the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy.\nShe's in her 30s - attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an\nair of authority about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a\nProfessor of Biology.\n\nWe tilt down from the screen. It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory\n-overhead lights, rows and rows of wire animal cages. Moving down death\nrow, feeding the lab animals, is Will Robinson.\n\nTWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE\nAT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS\nCAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThe exact cause of death is still unknown. What is certain - we're dealing\nwith something we've never seen before. Every organ in the body is\naffected...\n\nSuperimposed over Diamond's face is a three dimensional, computer-generated\ngraphic of the baby's body.\n\nWill forgets about what he's doing. He walks towards the screen. We push in\non it. Screeds of new data appear\n\nVascular System ...............Atrophied\n\nNeurological Function .........Senile dementia\n\nWe hold on Will's eyes - he stares at it.\n\nAN AUDITORIUM\n\nBilly Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing. About forty\nscientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.\n\nDiamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but\nyou don't become a Professor at Harvard' at her age without having an iron\nwill and a sparkling intelligence. She speaks with great authority -\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nThe baby in question, Michael James Flanagan -she points at the\ncomputer-generated graphic on a huge screen\n\nwas born at New York Hospital yesterday.\n\nMAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nBut the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports\nfrom a village in Bolivia, two cities in Australia, seven countries in\nEurope, a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.\n\nAs she speaks, pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations.\nThey dot their way across the entire globe. Dr Diamond turns to face her\naudience-\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nLike Michael Flanagan, they were full-term babies. Two hundred and seventy\neight days since conception and yet, by all reasonable medical standards,\nthey have completed their entire life cycle. They have gone from conception\nto death, not in three score years and ten, but in slightly less than nine\nmonths. Michael Flanagan died of old age.\n\nSilence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it. On a\nbalcony high above, another man is taking notes. He sits alone, almost\nhidden in shadow. It's Will Robinson.\n\nSHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR\n\nWill crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town.\nIt's night, the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock.\nSnapl The key breaks.\n\nWill curses. He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it. He\nslides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers. The padlock\nsprings open.\n\nSPIDERS\n\nweave a web in a corner of the storage unit. A work light hangs from the\nceiling. Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago. He puts\ntogether a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks.\n\nPULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A\nCASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES \"PLAY\"A HUGE\nROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING\nFROM YEARS AGO -\n\nWILL\n\n(on tape)\n\nI would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor...\n\nWe push in on Will's face as he listens to himself...\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nhave had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues. I'm\nprivileged to also call them my friends -\n\nA shadow of pain crosses his face. He shuts off the tape and sits\nmotionless.\n\nLAFAYETTE PARK\n\nNight. Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a\ncoming storm. Across the road, the first drops of rain splatter against the\nWhite House.\n\nA string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in\nfront of the West Portico. From inside, we hear a man's voice -\nwell-spoken, authoritative\n\nPRESIDENT (O.S.)\n\nThere's no mistake - you're sure?\n\nJEFFERSON LIBRARY\n\nDiamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the\nhearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of\nStaff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is\nlittered with graphs end files.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The\nnumber is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.\n\nThe President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing\nacross his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look\nolder.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nThat's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven\nmillion cases. After that we hit the wall -\n\nShe pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nAccording to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.\n\nThe President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up\nthe bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nThese are just computer projections -\n\nspecies don't disappear that fast.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nTell that to the dinosaurs, sir.\n\nHe looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR\n\nWhat date - when exactly do we hit this wall?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nSix months and twenty-one days.\n\nSilence. The President keeps looking out the window.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nCan't somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with. Is it a virus or\nwhat?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe don't know, sir.\n\nThe President turns to the Chief of Staff.\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nWhatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman put together the Manhattan\nProject - you understand?\n\nThe Chief of Staff nods his head - yes.\n\nPRESIDENT (CONT'D)\n\n(softly)\n\nA world without children -it's inconceivable. And what about the rest of us\n- what do we do? Just sit and watch our species die? Will the last person\nto leave the planet turn out the lights.\n\nSilence again. Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -\nspeaks.\n\nPRESS SECRETARY\n\nWe're going to have to manage the public. Right now, the truth may be\ninoperative -\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nOf course we're going to have to manage itl We're going to have to manage a\nwhole lot of things. But can't we take at least one moment to be human?\n\nHe looks around the room. We hold on their somber faces.\n\nA CHEAP APARTMENT\n\nThrough the window - the neon sign of a gas station. This is Will's place,\nHe lives alone - a bed in the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the\nsink.\n\nThe kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old\ncomputer, surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks. He\nstares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred. He's been at\nthis so long, he can barely focus. He rubs his hand across his eyes.\n\nA small mewing sound. Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in\na basket, panting. Will goes to her.\n\nShe's giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her.\nWill strokes the mother's head, looking at the miracle of new life. He puts\nhis fingers in a water bowl, about to moisten the mother's mouth.\n\nThen he stops. He looks again at the kitten - there's two of them now. A\nbeat as he just stares -\n\nWILL\n\n(softly)\n\nJesus Christ... of course!\n\nA LUXURIOUS BATHROOM\n\nThrough frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower.\nWhoever she is, she's got a great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The\nshower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it's\nalmost midnight.\n\nVIDEO ENTRY PHONE\n\nA video screen monitors the front door. On it we see Will - his hair\ntousled, an old overcoat buttoned to the neck, a battered briefcase under\nhis arm.\n\nDiamond - a towel around her shoulders, hair dripping - picks up the phone.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWho is it?\n\nWILL (O.S.)\n\nWill Robinson.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI think you have the wrong house.\n\nWILL (O.S.)\n\nI work at the department.\n\nHe turns and looks straight into the camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers\nher breasts. She looks at him - recognition dawns.\n\nAN ELEGANT ROOM\n\nWill and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden\nfloors and beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear any make-up -just jeans and\nan oversized shirt. She looks even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease\nWill's nerves. He's got his briefcase open in front of him, speaking from\nsheaves of notes and papers.\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(interrupting)\n\nHold on - how do you know about the case load? The Government's trying to\nmanage this - they've withheld that information.\n\nWILL\n\nThe Internet, Doctor. It's a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want. I\ngot into 'the Center for Disease Control. I had a look at their raw data.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nJesus. Do you know what you're doing? This is the White House we're talking\nabout.\n\nWILL\n\n(Heated))\n\nNo, it's a disease and it doesn't come any worse than this - that's what\nwe're talking about.\n\nHE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,\nQUIETLY -\n\nWILL\n\nI've listened at the lab - I think I know where you're looking. Bacterias\nmostly, but there's a strong push into the retro-viruses. You're wrong,\nDoctor.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nReally - and I thought I was arrogant. But then, I'm just a professor.\n\nWILL\n\nNo virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI can think of one.\n\nWILL\n\nSure, it can start in pockets but it never stays there. This thing does. It\nonly affects women of child-bearing age. What - it's so smart it can\nrecognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, this is into the very heart of\nwhat we are. This is genetic. This is part of the DNA.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThank you. A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows\nit down.\n\nWILL\n\nAs a matter of fact it does. There's only one part of the DNA that's passed\nexclusively through women. Thirty-seven genes, the oldest part of the human\norganism -\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(realizing)\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA.\n\nWILL\n\nOver the years there's been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that\nsomehow it triggers aging, He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from\nscientific journals across the table. She doesn't pay them any attention -\nshe's thinking.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nYou realize what you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd get it\nfor sure. A virus -you'd have to say we've got a chance. But say you're\nright. The mitochondrial DNA - that's so far out on the frontier, we can\nbarely see it.\n\nWILL\n\nLike I said - it doesn't get any worse than this.\n\nShe keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table. A\nbeat.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nAre you okay?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nSure.\n\nWILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -\n\nWILL\n\nShit. You're pregnant, aren't you?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nNine weeks.\n\nTHEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO\nHER FEET -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nDo you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or something?\n\nWILL\n\n(Recoiling)\n\nNo...no, I'm fine thanks.\n\nWatches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered\nbriefcase.\n\nAN EMPTY STREET\n\nIt's late at night. Will clutches his briefcase under his arm, heading\nhome. A bitter wind blows out of the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn\nfigure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the\nstreetlights.\n\nCONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS\n\nRUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,\nDOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.\nTHEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW\nIN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -\n\nHAND HITS A TABLE\n\nIT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE\nMIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN\nARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIt's just an idea, Bob. All we're doing is taking it for a walk around the\nblock.\n\nA man in his 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.\n\nDE MAUPASSANT\n\nThere was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details\nbut someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory.\nIf you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through\nevolution - like a time machine.\n\nBOB\n\nWowl Those 70s, man. I'm really sorry I missed them.\n\nEveryone - Diamond included - laughs.\n\nOLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT\n\nThey hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office, just a\nhole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own. He sits at a table, making\nnotes. A knock - Diamond enters.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI thought you'd like to know - we're looking at mitochondrial DNA,\n\nWILL\n\nThanks for telling me.\n\nTHEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE\nWHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIs that you?\n\nShe points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos,\nWill nods.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nSeattle. Is that where you went to school?\n\nWill hesitates - we sense that he doesn't really want to answer.\n\nWILL\n\nNo. Princeton.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nExpensive.\n\nWILL\n\nA scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate work... I never really\nfinished.\n\nSomething in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond\npause. She recovers and looks in her wallet. She pulls out a photograph and\nhands it to Will. It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished\nhull.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nIt's a Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen one of those in years. She's a beautiful\nboati\n\nDIAMOND\n\nMy grandfather left it to me. I don't sail it much any more - it's too hard\nto find a for'etd hand.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat about your husband - doesn't he sail.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI don't know - I haven't met him yet.\n\nWILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI wanted a baby but I'm thirty-four-years old. Sooner or later you realize\nthat somewhere along the way you've missed the man you've been waiting for.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat did you do - ask a friend?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI thought of it.\n\nWILL\n\nLucky friend.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic, but it worked.\n\n(pauses)\n\nGood idea, bad timing.\n\nWILL\n\nHow many people have you put on the mDNA?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nSeven.\n\nWILL\n\nThat's all?!\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThat's all I can spare. It's just a theory -one of dozens of theories.\n\nWill looks away in disgust.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nWhat is it with you - it's not just science is it? Why are you so\npassionate about this?\n\nWILL\n\nI know I'm right. It's a mutation. A hundred thousand years it's probably\nbeen lying there -shifting, weaving into the mDNA. You either go back and\nchange evolution or you engineer it out. Seven peopleYou might as well\nshoot peas at a dam.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nYou haven't answered my question - why so passionate?\n\nWILL\n\nThe question's not relevant. The only thing I'm interested in is the\nscience.\n\nHe turns back to his work. We hear the door close as Diamond leaves.\n\nA GEODESIC DOME\n\nWhite, space-age, is being erected on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the\nNASA trucks. We pull back through a high window of the Biology building. A\nwoman stands there, looking out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her\noffice -\n\nMCQUADE\n\nYou want to tell me what's going on?\n\nShe turns and looks at Diamond, sitting on the other side of the desk,\n\nDIAMOND\n\nDon't ask, Kris, I'd have to lie and I don't want to do that to my best\nfriend,\n\nMCQUADE\n\nThe rumor is, you've done something really big. They say the Defense\nDepartment is taking it over.\n\nDiamond just sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -\n\nMCQUADE (CONT'D)\n\nOkay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So what about this guy - what's he done?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHe hasn't done anything - I'm just interested.\n\nMCQUADE\n\nTen thousand employment records I've got on file and you want to know about\na lab assisant?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThe smartest assistant I've ever known.\n\nMCQUADE\n\nWhat - he can mop and fart at the same time?\n\nShe picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Will's\nphoto I.D.\n\nMCQUADE (CONT'D)\n\nHe's handsome, at least I'll say -\n\n(a thought strikes her)\n\nJesus - you're not interested in him like that, are you?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nNo, but he's the most unbelievable smelling man.\n\nMCQUADE\n\nSmelling? You're pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy. What\nexactly does he smell like?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nYou know...\n\n(searching for the right word)\n\n.., wholesome.\n\nMCQUADE\n\nOf course he does - that's the Lysol.\n\nDiamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing through WiU's\nfile -\n\nMCQUADE (CONT'D)\n\nThat's strange - there's supposed to be a background sheet. Family, school\n-all that shit. It must have gotten lost.\n\nBefore Diamond can say anything, a young man enters. He's McQuada's\nassistant.\n\nASSISTANT\n\nYour secretary's on the line, Dr Diamond. There's a call for you.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nTell her to take a message.\n\nASSISTANT\n\nIt's the New York Times.\n\nMCQUADE\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI think Washington's news management just went south.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nNight. Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and\nFrench reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of\nABC.\n\nJENNINGS (O.S.)\n\nWe're standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on\nthis remarkable day. I don't think there's a person anywhere who's not\nsitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way\nto the press room -\n\nFIFTH AVENUE\n\nis totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades. He skates effortlessly\ndown the deserted avenue - past Tiffany's and the Trump Tower, all silent\nnow.\n\nPRESIDENT (O.S.)\n\nMy fellow Americans...\n\nThe rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John. The front doors are open.\nSomeone is playing the organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades\ninto the night.\n\nSTEEL DOOR OPENS\n\nA sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a\nvaulted basement. All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of\nequipment...\n\nCARETAKER\n\nThis used to be the basement of the Psychology Department. We just sort of\nstacked everything around 'em -\n\nHe flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light. He points at two\nlong iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of\nvalves and pipes.\n\nCARETAKER (CONT'D)\n\nFlotation tanks. They used 'em for experiments in sensory degradation -\n\nWILL\n\nDeprivation - sensory deprivation.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nYeah, well - whatever.\n\nSHAFT OF LIGHT\n\nWILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS\nINTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE\nSTARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -\n\nYOUNG MAN (O.S.)\n\nNow I know what a mole feels like -\n\nYOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)\n\n(lightly)\n\nIt feels like a fucking coffin, that's what it feels like.\n\nOther voices laugh. They're all young and like the young they think they'll\nnever die.\n\nCARETAKER (O.S.)\n\nHey, fella - what are you doing?\n\nHE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE\nTURNS -\n\nWILL\n\nJust looking. I'll be coming back - I'll need a key.\n\nThe caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs out of the tank.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nOne other thing - don't tell anyone, huh?\n\nCARETAKER\n\nWho would I tell? They treat me like shit Worse than shit. All work, no\nappreciation. The phantom of Harvard. Someone should write a fucking\nmusical about me.\n\nCIRCLES OF LIGHT\n\nDesk lamps, glowing in an office. Diamond and a team of researchers are\nworking through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers.\n\nRESEARCHER\n\nHere's another one - \"Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past.\"\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWho's it by?\n\nRESEARCHER\n\nSame guy - Doctor Robert Plant.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nJesus, what did this guy do - write the book on it? Who is he?\n\nHUGE BOOK BEING OPENED\n\nIt's a scientific directory. The researcher flicks the pages and stops at\n\"Plant\".\n\nRESEARCHER\n\nWow - I thought your career was impressive.\n\nDiamond looks up from her reading.\n\nRESEARCHER (CONT'D)\n\nDegrees in medicine and microbiology. A PhD at 24, a member of the Academy\nof Sciences, published twenty times by 1974...\n\nDIAMOND\n\nAnd then?\n\nRESEARCHER\n\nThen nothing.\n\nDIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhere did he go as an undergraduate?\n\nRESEARCHER\n\nPrinceton.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nOn a scholarship?\n\nA CORRIDOR\n\nIt's late at night. The scientists and their staff are working around the\nclock. Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles, vials, and catheters down\na crowded corridor. Diamond pushes through the people behind, trying to\ncatch up to him. Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nRobert!\n\nWill keeps walking, heading for an elevator. Diamond skirts around a knot\nof people.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nDoctor Plant!\n\nWill hesitates - one split second - then keeps going. The elevator doors\nslide open. Will steps in, turns and hits a button. He watches Diamond\npushing towards him. For a moment their eyes meet. She comes closer.\nSswhish! The doors slide shut.\n\nDIAMOND'S OFFICE\n\nShe sits behind her desk, listening to the chief of campus security.\n\nSECURITY OFFICER\n\nThe equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs. It includes a\nrange of genetic material-\n\n(hands her an inventory)\n\nWe've checked all the buildings your team is using - he's not in any of\nthem.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat about hie house?\n\nSECURITY OFFICER\n\nHe asked his landlady to look after his cat. She hasn't seen him for three\ndays.\n\nIN THE BASEMENT\n\nthere's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to\nit is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials.\n\nWill is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and\nequations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,\ncarrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -\n\nCARETAKER\n\nYou wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?\n\nWILL\n\nLooking for a date.\n\nThe caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the\nscreen -\n\nCARETAKER\n\nWhat's wrong with a calendar?\n\nWILL\n\nThese are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a\ntrail of mutations, I can date them. I'm trying to find out when a major\nchange occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... well that makes sense.\n\nBut Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding in\ncomplex commands. The caretaker watches him -\n\nCARETAKER (CONT'D)\n\nYou've found it?\n\nWILL\n\nMaybe...\n\nHe has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen. He moves\nthem together. Aa they overlap, we see they're not identical - the tail of\none kicks upwarda. Will starel at it -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\n(softly)\n\nYeah - I've found it.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nSo - what's the date?\n\nWill presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain\nmolecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the\nsecond molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -\n\nWILL\n\nThe best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nSort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.\n\nDIAMOND'S OFFICE\n\nDiamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a\npage -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three\ncolleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young\nwoman.\n\nDiamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the\ncaption. We push in on it and hold on the words... \"UC Berkeley\".\n\nWE ARE FLYING\n\nswooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,\ntumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -\nwe pull back to reveal they're computer-generated images, playing on the\nscreens in the basement.\n\nThe caretaker has pulled up a chair. He and Will are watching the images\ngenerated by a CD-ROM.\n\nWILL\n\nThis is someone's version of the prehistoric world. I'm interested in the\ngeography, the atmosphere -that sort of stuff.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nWhere are we?\n\nWILL\n\nAfrica - that's where Mankind started.\n\nWill keeps looking at the strange images. The caretaker gets to his feet -\n\nCARETAKER\n\nI'll see you in the morning.\n\nWILL\n\nYeah.\n\nThe caretaker limps towards the door. Will looks up -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nThank you - for helping me, I mean.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nIt sounds like you're leaving or something.\n\nWILL\n\nNo. I just wanted to say it, that's all.\n\nThe caretaker keeps looking at him -\n\nCARETAKER\n\nWhat exactly are you doing? You're a bit old to try and make your mark,\naren't you? Anyway, nobody listens to people like us.\n\nWILL\n\nFate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance. Do you know what\nit's like to be ridiculed, to have your ideas thrown back in your face? And\nthat was the easy part. I guess that's what I'm doing - I want to prove\nthat I was right.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nYou're lying to me.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat do you mean?!\n\nCARETAKER\n\nYou are going somewhere. I don't know where it is. I'm not even sure I can\nimagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you find whatever it is you're\nlooking for.\n\nWILL\n\nThanks.\n\nCARETAKER\n\nNo point in getting you breakfast, huh?\n\nWill shakes his head - no. They smile at each other. The caretaker turns\nand goes.\n\nDIAMOND'S OFFICE\n\nDiamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk. Her\nSecretary stands in the doorway -\n\nSECRETARY\n\nI've got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone. She runs the archives at Berkeley.\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(into phone)\n\nMs Wilkins?\n\nWe push in tight on Diamond's face as she listens. Anxiety and alarm\nregister on it.\n\nOUTER OFFICE\n\nThe security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the\ncampus. Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office, rumors are\nflying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office. She\nlooks at deMaupassant.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nYou were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the\none that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.\nWithin every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our\ngenes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back\ndown it. Through the womb. Through time and space -\n\n(she looks at them all)\n\nThat's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change\nevolution.\n\nSECURITY OFFICER\n\nIs that possible?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHe was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic\nmaterial for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.\n\nTHE FLOTATION TANKS\n\nThe valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.\n\nWill sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his\nforehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He\nopens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -\nminutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The\nfluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.\n\nA LONG CORRIDOR\n\nDiamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs.\nAhead -a pair of swing doors -\n\nBOB\n\nA theory's one thing - do you really think he'll try it?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHe's spent fifteen years as a lab assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up\nwith a cat. No family, no friends. What's There's left for him here? Of\ncourse he'll do it.\n\nSmack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.\n\nAN IRON LADDER\n\nWill climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a\ntremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles\ncontracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.\n\nSmash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get\nin. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to\ndistort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -\n\nSplashl He drops into the water. Clang! He closes the hatch.\n\nBarn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers a sledge\nhammer. Diamond steps in end throws a light switch.\n\nDARKNESS IN THE TANK\n\nWill floats on his back, the only sound is the rapid thump of his\nheartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into\nspasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into\nhis headl\n\nAll we see are the whites of them. They shatter into a web of capillaries -\n\nWILL'S POV\n\nred mist swirls in front of him. It resolves itself into a web of\ninterwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule. Will starts to\ntravel through it -\n\nINSIDE THE TANK\n\nWill is morphing, shedding cells - we're losing him in the warm, dark fluid\nof the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,\ndissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once\nwere.\n\nHis hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.\n\nOUTSIDE THE TANK\n\nNot a sound escapes. The security officer is about to try and open the\nhatch.\n\nDIAMOND (O.S.)\n\nNO!\n\nThe security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nIf we open the hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's too late - it's his\njourney, he's going to have to take it.\n\nINSIDE THE TANK\n\nWill's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less\ndistinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting\nshape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the\nwater -\n\nWILL'S POV\n\nHe spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it\nshatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling\nthrough the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling\nthrough space and time -\n\nOUTSIDE THE TANK\n\nDiamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working\nthe keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and\nstar charts.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nEverything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the\ndate -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.\n\nBOB\n\nBillie - there's a note for you.\n\nDiamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is\nwrit'ten -\n\nDIAMOND\n\n\"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,\nBillie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.\"\n\nTHE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT\n\nblaze through the heavens. They draw together, changing and reconstituting\ninto a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The\nstrands connect. A blast of light! It's the rays of -\n\nTHE SUN\n\nstreaming into a cave. Will lies in the fetal position, bleeding from his\nnose and ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags himself up\nand stumbles towards the entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn't see it,\nbut we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.\n\nA CRAGGY PEAK\n\nWill steps out of the cave. Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -\nplains and jungle and primordial forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped\nmountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth -\na rift valley. Will stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it.\nThe first step's over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the\nvalley is a tiny pillar of smoke.\n\nA FOREST CLEARING\n\nIn the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire. Will moves\ncautiously towards it. He stops - several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on\nthe ground.\n\nWill turns one of them over - he's got matted hair, a heavy brow and a\nshort, muscular body. As primitive as he is, there's no doubt of his\nspecies. He is a man. A Paleolithic man.\n\nThis was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of\ndead animals lie nearby. For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have\nbeen torn apart by wild animals. Then he looks up into the trees - more\nbodies of the hunters. But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains,\nleft there as some sort of trophy. Or a warning.\n\nCRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS\n\nWill is following a tiny trail through the forest. He's taken what is\nuseful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two\nshort-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on -\ndeeper into the shadows of the forest.\n\nA SPARKLING STREAM\n\nWill splashes through the crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake.\nA flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of\npink and gold.\n\nHe steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of\nover-arching trees. We hold on his feet - whip! He triggers something. A\nnet of woven vines engulfs him. He drops the spears and bedroll. Suddenly\nhe's soaring through the air.\n\nHe jerks to a halt - he's a netted animal hanging high in the trees. The\nfaces of two Paleolithic men, crouched on boughs, stare at him.\n\nPLUME OF WATER\n\ncascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires.\nScores of stone-age people - man, women and children - turn and look. Will,\nroped and bound, is being hauled into the encampment.\n\nThe primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him. They are\ndressed in skins and fur. talismans hang from their necks. The warriors\ncarry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads. It makes\nthem look even more savage.\n\nWill is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit. A\npile of ivory tusks lie nearby. The two captors jerk on the leash - it\nstops Will in front of a cave. Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and\nhead of their totema saber-toothed tiger. This is the Tribe of the Tiger.\n\nA man emerges from under its outstretched paws. He's in his late 20's -\nproud and strong. His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader. He and Will\nlook at one another.\n\nKip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race. Will\nstares at him - he has no idea what it means. He shrugs. Kip tries a new\ntack - he speaks. The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable,\nKiP Where is your tribe?\n\nWill pauses, searching for an answer- where do you start? He gives up.\n\nWILL\n\nI don't have a tribe.\n\nA rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe.\n\nKIP\n\nNo man can live without a tribe! How would he hunt the mighty animals? Who\nwould keep his fire burning?\n\nWILL\n\nI come from far away... I'm a traveler.\n\nKIP\n\nWhat is traveler? Is that a tribe?\n\nAgain Will's at a loss. Something catches Kip's eye. He reaches forward and\nrips the water bag out from under Will's coat. The tribe reacts -\n\nKIP (CONT'D)\n\nYou carry things taken from our hunters! Kill him.\n\nHe turns away. Will throws himself at him -\n\nWILL\n\nNO!\n\nWhackl A blow to the back of Will's neck knocks him to his knees. He looks\nup -two warriors have their spears raised, about to plunge them into his\nchest.\n\nA sound like thunder - it's hooves. The warriors turn. Will follows their\ngaze - half an army, mounted on horseback, surges into the gorge, They are\nheavily armed, dressed in armor but it's not their weaponry that astonishes\nWill. These are apes!\n\nThe tribes-people scream in terror. They turn and run. The two warriors\nforget about Will. He dives for cover in a pile of rocks. As he tears\nhimself free of the ropes that bind him, he looks out -\n\nThe apes charge in to the camp. At their head is a huge gorillarippling\nmuscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow, like pissholes in the\nsnow. He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver. His name is Drak. He\nis the Lord of the High Rivers, supreme commander of the ape army. On\neither side ride his elite Praetorian Guard.\n\nWoo-woo-woo! Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head. It's a\nbull-roarer. The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to\nKip's side. Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between\nthe apes and their panic-driven people, trying to buy them time to get into\nthe cave.\n\nSswhish! The sound of arrows. The apes carry triple-barreled iron\ncrossbows.\n\nShort iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down. Dust and smoke swirls\nacross the camp. Kip and his men, fighting all the way, retreat towards the\ncave.\n\nA baby's cry! Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth, left behind in the\nconfusion. Will half rises to his feet, about to go for him. Too late -\nthere's a blur of movement irt the trees. A tribe-boy - too young to be a\nwarrior - has come back for the child.\n\nOut of the dust and smoke - Drak! Foam flies from his horse's mouth. He's\nseen the boy and the child. He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight\nunder his huge bicep.\n\nWill screams a warning. The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires. A hail of\niron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down.\n\nRage flashes in Will's eyes. He scrambles over a boulder and rips a\ncrossbow from a dead ape's hand. He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs\na lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it. A\nsound behind him - little more than a whisper. He swings -It's an arrow.\nWhackl It rips into his shoulder, hurling him to the ground. Ape infantry -\nfoot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him.\n\nIn their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector\nsets. One is the Claw, one is the Balls and the other is the Flame.\n\nTHE CAVE ENTRANCE\n\nKip and his warriors have seen them too. They scramble into the cave. Men\nand women are inside, swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from\ntree trunks.\n\nOther warriors, caught outside, run for the closing gap. On their heels is\nWill - still clutching the crossbow, blood streaming from his wound. The\ndoors are closing... closing. Will dives through the gap, almost crushed -\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE\n\nSlam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A huge cross-beam drops into place. Will,\nsprawled in the dust, looks up - chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is\ntending the wounded, children are screaming, women and old people are\nclambering up a series of ledges. High above is a tiny slash of\ndaylightanother entrance.\n\nFrom deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesn't\nhave time to think about it. Smash! The great wooden doors shudder from\nsome mighty blow.\n\nOUTSIDE THE DOORS\n\nThe three machines are in place. The first of them has two huge stone balls\nsuspended by chains from an overhead jib. An ape sits right on top,\noperating it. The balls dance and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door,\nopening a hole.\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE\n\nDaylight streams in. Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high\naround the walls, ready to attack when the apes pour in. A pair of huge\niron jaws appear in the hole. This is the second of the apes' machines -\nthe Claw.\n\nAnother roar from the animal. Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the\nmassive crossbeam. It snaps it like a twig. Will gets to his feet and runs.\nHe sees Kip signal -\n\nAN OLD WARRIOR\n\nis perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the\ncave, turning it into a cage. He opens it.\n\nCrash! The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open. The first of\nthe ape cavalry charges in. A roar from the unseen animal. The apes' horses\ncatch the scent of it. They whinny in terror.\n\nWill stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage. The\ntribe's totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times\nthe size of its Bengal cousin, a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch\nteeth curved down either side of its jaw.\n\nThe horses are bucking and rearing. The tiger leaps towards the door,\nheading for freedom. A dismounted ape raises his weapon. The tiger doesn't\neven break stride. One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and\nflesh of the ape's chest.\n\nWill can smell the animal's breath as it flies past. An ape officer, still\non his horse, turns - another swipe from the.tiger's paw rips out his\nthroat.\n\nKip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -\nhalf of them dismounted, all of them in disarray. The tiger runs soars\nthrough the doorway -\n\nOUTSIDE THE CAVE\n\nDrak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into\nthe forest.\n\nON THE LEDGES\n\nKip's men are fighting as they retreat, heading towards the opening at the\nroof of the cave. Will, clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way\nup the wall.\n\nBeneath him, Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long\niron tube in a rolling superstructure. Feeding it are a series of\noil-filled bladders. One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole. A\ntongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube. It's a flame thrower -The\nfiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave. The flame engulfs two\nwarriors. Skin blazing, they plummet to the ground.\n\nThe flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall, filling the cave\nwit a pall of smoke. It hits the tiny patch of daylight, cutting off\nescape.\n\nWill - trapped - runs along a ledge, over a pile of rocks and jumps. Into\nmid-air! He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels\ninto its flanks.\n\nThe apes and the surviving warriors turn. For a moment they just stare -\nnobody's ever seen a human ride a horse before. Will flies towards the\nentrance. He sees Kip on a ledge just above, battling three huge apes.\n\nWILL\n\nJump!\n\nKip sees Will galloping towards him. One of the apes raises a double-bladed\nsword. Kip jumps sprawling across the horse's neck, grabbing on to its\nflowing mane.\n\nDrak stares at Will - he's never seen anything like him. He wheels his\nhorse around and spurs it forward in pursuit.\n\nOUTSIDE THE CAVE\n\nWill's horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls.\nThe apes turn and look - astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak\ncharges through.\n\nWill hurtles towards the trees. Kip, hanging on for life, looks behind -\nDrak raises his Gatling gun and aims. Kip wrenches Will's head down - zing!\nThe arrows skim past.\n\nDrak can't outpace them - and he can't re-load at the gallop either. They\ncharge out of the camp, into -\n\nTHE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST\n\nDrak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge\nape stands on the back of the charging horse!\n\nHe jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough. He swings\nhimself up into the tree - he is an ape, after all. He throws himself from\nbranch to bough, traveling at incredible speed.\n\nWill glances back - he sees Drak's riderless horse. His eyes dart in\nconfusion -where is he? We crane up - he's in the trees above! Drak jumps -\n\nWham! Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Will's shoulder, lifting him\nout of the saddle and hurling him to the ground.\n\nKip hauls down on the horse's bridle - wheeling the stallion around.\n\nWill looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him. Will sees Kip coming\nback -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nRun!\n\nA volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the\ntrees. Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away.\n\nmassive, armor-clad paw grabs Will's head. He looks straight into Drak's\nface. The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Will's cheek. Will tries to\nstifle the scream. Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -\n\nDRAK\n\nSo - it's human, after ell.\n\nHe spits the blood out in revulsion. Will stares into the piu-holes in his\nface. Never has he seen eyes so cold.\n\nWill tries to rise to hie feet. His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he\nstaggers. Drak's clenched fist, clad in chain mail, drives straight et\nWill's jaw. Smashl Fade to black.\n\nTHE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nIt's Will's point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart.\nHe's very weak, his shirt drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image\nrights itself.\n\nHe drags himself on to all fours but he can't get any further - his legs\nare chained.\n\nWILL\n\n(fevered, disoriented)\n\nWhere the fuck am I?\n\nWill looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon.\n\nGUARD\n\n(smiling)\n\nThe end of the road.\n\nWill - confused, panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to\nhis knees. He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down\nan avenue of idols -towering statues of apes, sculpted out of stone, old as\nages past. Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red,\nflickering glow.\n\nWill turns away. Behind him he sees humans, rows of them - dead - hanging\nupsidl down from long poles like trophies.\n\nEverything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart,\neyes barely focused. Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool\nbetween his legs. He doesn't even notice it.\n\nMASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE\n\nspans a roaring river. Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up -\nlaid out before is a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged\nravine. Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of\nstone.\n\nApes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house, chattering in\nthe trees, swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from\none side of the ravine to the other.\n\nWill has roused himself. He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to\nhim, it appears to float. Buildings swim in and out of focus. His shoulders\nshake - he starts to laugh, an edge of hysteria to it.\n\nWILL\n\nA city... of course. Ape city! I've destroyed my mind. Or maybe I'm dead\nand this is God's last joke - hell is ruled by apes.\n\nWhhish - the end of a whip sails through the air. Crack! It hits Will's\nback, doubling him over.\n\nGUARD\n\nQuiet, animal!\n\nRIPPLES OF WATER\n\nrun across the surface of a beautiful pool. A black shape glides along\nunderwater. The head breaks the surface - it's an old gorilla, the fur on\nhis face gray and balding. This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President -\nof the Council of Elders.\n\nHe walks out of the water. Other old apes - all male, their days of warring\nand building over - lie around the pool. Several of them, draped only in\nrough loin-cloths, groom each other, picking nits out of their fur.\n\nThe sound of a gong! Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the\npool. He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end, Drak and his\ntroop come into view.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nThe raiders are home.\n\nOLD APE\n\n(lazily)\n\nGood hunting?\n\nNazgul squints against the sun. He sees the poles carrying the dead humans.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nBy the look of it.\n\nGRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR, HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES, GETS\nUP -\n\nGRAY BEARD\n\n(proudly)\n\nNot as good as when we rode the high ridges, I'll warrant.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nTimes are different now. Back then, a could go out and come back with a\nbrace of animals. They're far scarcer now -\n\nOLD APE\n\nNot scarce enough, I say.\n\nThere's a murmur of agreement from the other apes.\n\nA TINY BOAT\n\nis wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape.\nThe boat drifts down an underground stream. All around it rise the stone\nwalls of a huge cavern. Torches light up the gloom - this place is a\ntemple.\n\nA group of apes - mourners - walk along a path, keeping pace with the\nfuneral boat.\n\nThey make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for\nthe dead.\n\nAt the head of the procession, swinging a smoking censer, is an ape wearing\na lion-skin cloak. His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye,\nthe other is just an empty socket. Beneath the cloak, one arm and a leg are\nwithered. The whole effect, rather than diminishing his power, enhances it.\nHis name is MA-GOG. He is high priest of the apes, defender of the faith,\nkeeper of the Book of the Lore.\n\nThe funeral boat gathers speed in the current. It thrusts towards sunlight\npouring through an arch.\n\nA ROCK PLATFORM\n\nThe mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock. We pull back\nto reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of\nthe face of a cliff, Its bowed front legs form the archway, the entrance to\nthe temple of the ape.\n\nCLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS. ALL\nAROUND THEM, THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER. THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE\nTEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER. MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -\n\nMA -GOG\n\n(intoning)\n\nIn the beginning was the word, and the word was the Book of the Lore. It\nsays God created the ape in His own image. Alone among His creatures, the\nape has a soul. One crosses the river now but death is only a door. He will\ndwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests\nwith their fists. They repeat the word \"Amen\".\n\nFor a moment the clouds of mist clear. Now we see where the boat is headed\n- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop. These are the Falls of No\nReturn. The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes.\n\nThe sound of cheering voices, very faint, drifts towards them. Ma-Gog turns\nand looks up the river towards the city -\n\nAPES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'\n\nlooking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut\ninto the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings\nto greet them.\n\nWill lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at\nhim - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -\nstands with his grandfather.\n\nKID\n\nWhat is it?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n\nSome... sort of human.\n\nKID\n\nBut look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n\nI don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower\nof the Moon.\n\nTHE WORD \"TRAVELER\" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE\nCROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -\n\nWOMAN\n\nNo it's not - it's a mutant.\n\nLABORER\n\nPut it in the zoo!\n\nA female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of\nauthority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a\nseries of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a\ndoctor.\n\nShe and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.\nKneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's\ncrotch.\n\nZORA\n\nWhatever it is, it's male.\n\nShe rips open Will's shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping\nwound.\n\nZORA (CONT'D)\n\nProbe.\n\nThe Assistant hands her a steel instrument. She slides it towards the\nwound. We hold on Will's face - a strangled cry but he doesn't regain\nconsciousness. Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant. She calls\nout -\n\nZORA (CONT'D)\n\nDrak!\n\nThe leader of the ape warriors, riding close by, turns -\n\nZORA (CONT'D)\n\nThe animal's bleeding to death, my Lord.\n\nDrak rides up to the wagon.\n\nDRAK\n\nI didn't bring him all this way just to have him die.\n\nZORA\n\n(to the assistant)\n\nBen-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl\n\nAN APE IN A LEATHER APRON\n\nuses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET.\nWill lies on a stone slab nearby - it's a sort of medical centersinks along\nthe walls, racks of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.\n\nThe Vet cuts the clothing away from Will's wound. He turns to Doctor Zora -\n\nVET\n\nWe're going to have to give him blood.\n\nPRISONER IN A CELL\n\nHe's a tribesman - in his late 40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow\ncheeks, he carries himself with dignity - he's a proud man. His name is\nARAGORN. On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament, like\ncrescent moon. Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of\nvarious tribes.\n\nThe sound of a key in lock. Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back.\nThree ape guards enter. Two of them, armed with spears, drive Aragorn into\na corner. The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole. He drops\nit over Aragorn's head.\n\nAragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight. They drag him from\nthe cell.\n\nTEAM OF HORSES\n\n- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel\nthat controls a series of pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a\nheavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a\nseries of impressive house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of\nthe city.\n\nStanding on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders. They look\ndown on the central square. It's crowded with apes - soldiers are being\ngreeted by their kin.\n\nARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK\n\nHe's strapped to a slab, half-naked, in the medical center. They've put a\ngag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself, he can barely\nmove.\n\nWill, still unconscious, lies on a table next to him. Nazgul peers down at\nhim.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nIt's human, you say?\n\nDoctor Zora nods - yes.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nIt's even uglier than the others.\n\nHe pulls a covering aside and looks at Will's naked legs.\n\nNAZGUL (CONT'D)\n\nHow can he hunt with legs like those -they're like twigs. Maybe he's\ndiseased.\n\nEverybody shrugs - who knows?\n\nThe Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame. The other end of the\nneedle is attached to a length of animal intestine. It acts as a tube. The\nVet grabs Will's forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein.\nWill's body jerks with the pain. Nazgul and the others spring back.\n\nFor a moment Will's wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled\nroom, a bandage on his chest, a bladder full of blood hanging above him.\nHis puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks he's in hospital\n\nWILL\n\n(groggy)\n\nHelp me. I've got health insurance. Honest...\n\nHis eyes close as he slips back into darkness. Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nWhat is health insurance?\n\nDOCTOR ZORA\n\nSome sort of religion...?\n\nThe Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder. Another length of\ntubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorn's arm. It's\nhis blood. Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nDo you think this'Il work?\n\nVET\n\nYou can never tell with animals. Their bodies aren't as sophisticated as an\nape's. Sometimes their blood fights with each other. Either way, you know\nreally quick -they get up and walk around, or they're dead.\n\nThe Vet turns a little tap - Aragorn's blood flows down the tube. It hits\nWill's vein.\n\nWORDS CHISELED INTO STONE\n\n\"An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light.\"\n\nEuripadape III\n\nIt stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge. This is the Hall\nof Learning. Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up\nthe steps.\n\nTHE BLADDER OF BLOOD\n\nis empty. Guards are collaring Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door\ninto the room is thrown open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet\nhim but he barely acknowledges it *\n\nMA-GOG\n\nShow him to me.\n\nThe Vet grabs Will's hair. He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his\nface.\n\nThe high priest takes a step back - there's something about Will that fills\nhim with loathing. Anger flashes in his one good eye. He stares at Will.\nHis voice is Iow, almost to himself -\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\nAll my life I've dreaded this day.\n\n(turns to the others)\n\nKill him.\n\nDOCTOR ZORA\n\nWe've just spent an hour trying to save him -\n\nMA-GOG\n\nKill him!\n\nHe grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground. Doctor\nZora takes his arm, stopping him -\n\nDOCTOR ZORA\n\nThe animal's unique, my lord. At least we should look at his brain. Maybe\nit's possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him. Imagine - a\ntame human!\n\nMA-GOG\n\nMan can't be tamed. Alone among God's primates he kills for lust or greed.\nHe will murder his own brother to possess his brother's land.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nThe doctor's only asking for a chance to experiment. The benefits would be\nenormous. A tame species of human could double food production, at last we\ncould dam the rivers.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nYou don't know what you're dealing with.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nIt's just an animal, Ma-Gog.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nIt's not. That's the trouble.\n\nA movement on the stone slab. They turn and look - Will's eyelids are\nfluttering. He's starting to come round. itl\n\nHe turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders.\n\nWill's eyes are open now. Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape\nguards coming for him. He tries to struggle but he's very weak. They haul\nhim off.\n\nHEAVY IRON DOOR\n\nset in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole. We tilt up the door to a\nnarrow set of bars high above it. A face, straining with effort, rises up\nto peer through the bars. It is Will - looking like death but forcing\nhimself to do it, desperate to see where he is.\n\nINSIDE THE CELL\n\nThe muscles across his shoulders ripple. His one good hand clutches the\nbars. He hangs by it, supporting his weight, staring out at a vaulted\nunderground cavern. It looks like a cattle-yard, broken down and disused\nnowa series of long pens, wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.\n\nWill can't support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground. He crawls\nacross the floor and examines the door. It fits tight to the rock. There's\nno hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesn't even come all the way\nthrough.\n\nSuddenly he stops. Nothing for a moment, then he hears it again - a\nscraping sound.\n\nHe peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall. One of\nthe blocks moves. Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell. Aragorn\nsqueezes through from the adjoining cell. He looks at Will -\n\nARAGORN\n\nSo you lived, then?\n\nWILL\n\nWhat did they do?\n\nARAGORN\n\nThey gave you blood.\n\nHe holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from.\n\nWILL\n\nI hope you had a medical.\n\nAragorn looks at him - confused. From a distance, the sound of horses\nwhinnying.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nWhat is this place?\n\nARAGORN\n\nIt was a slaughterhouse.\n\nWILL\n\nFor horses?\n\nARAGORN\n\nThey use it for stables now. No - s different kind of animal. For humans.\n\nWill stares, taken aback. Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners\nof the cell.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nIn my father's time, the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here.\nYoung apes killed some during their manhood rites, the others were made\nsport of in the corrals. At the end, the bodies were thrown onto the belts\nand fed to the fire.\n\nAragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves. From out of his cloak, he\ntakes two pieces of flint and strikes them. A spark starts the fire -\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\n(softly)\n\nDeath is stuck to these walls, stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters\ncan take away. Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the\nscreams of my people.\n\nWill looks at him. Firelight plays across their faces.\n\nWILL\n\nWhy haven't they killed you?\n\nARAGORN\n\nThey keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn -\n\nHe lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards. It's some form of greeting. Will\nreturns it.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nI am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the Leader of the Seven Tribes. They\nhope the warriors will come and try to free me.\n\nWILL\n\nAnd will they?\n\nARAGORN\n\nNot if they fear my anger. I was taken in summer and now winter's almost\ngone. Even the apes grow tired - soon they'll make me walk the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nWill looks at Aragorn's eyes - they're fearless. The ornament glints on his\nchest. Will points at it -\n\nWILL\n\nwhat is it?\n\nARAGORN\n\nIt's called the Crescent of Light - it's the talisman of my rank.\n\nWILL\n\nSilver.\n\nARAGORN\n\nMithral is how we name it..\n\nWill reaches his hand towards it -\n\nWILL\n\nCan I borrow it?\n\nAragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him. His\nhand closes around the insignia -\n\nARAGORN\n\nWho are you? What brings you to the valley of the tribes?\n\nWILL\n\nI meant you no harm. I'm looking for woman, one of my own kind. Do you know\nof people like me?\n\nARAGORN\n\nNever.\n\nWill nods his head, accepting it. Slowly he reaches his hand out -\n\nWILL\n\nIf you want to get out of hare. I need the talisman. Aragorn.\n\nThe two men look at each other. A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and\nunfastens it.\n\nTHE TEMPLE OF THE APE\n\nTorches burn on the walls. They cast a glow across the temple - the\nunderground stream, pools of water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls.\nSeveral apes crouch on them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.\n\nMist rises off of the pools. Moving through it, we see Nazgul, Drak and e\ngroup of old apes. The Council of Elders is gathering. They pass through a\nnarrow door -\n\nTHE TEMPLE'S INNER CHAMBER\n\nOil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an\nancient book - strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This\nis the Book of the Lore.\n\nMa-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul, Drak\nand five other huge apes - all leaders in their time.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nHow many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore?\n\nNobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer.\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\nOne-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every child knows that.\n\n(softly)\n\nBut every child is wrong. There is one more scroll - the last scroll,\nsealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest to high priest...\n\nHe slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden\ncatch. The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up, revealing a\nsecret compartment. It is lined with gold leaf. Lying in it is a slim folio\nof pages -\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\nIt is called the Scroll of Revelation.\n\nThe Council of Elders stare in awed silence. Ma-Gog takes the pages out and\nunfastens the seals. He reads -\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\n\"And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages. A silence fell and I\nsaw a new heaven and a new earth. Like through a glass, darkly, I saw the\nfuture.\"\n\nThe Council of Elders stare at him. He limps forward and stops in front of\nthem. He recites from memory -\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\n\"Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the\nhorse is Death. Those that ride on him are beasts, but like no beasts born\nbefore. Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea. They\nare given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and\nwith fire. And let him that hath understanding know the number of these\nbeasts. It is the number of Man.\"\n\nHe raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors.\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\nToday we saw that beast. Mark those words, my Lords - \"their limbs are weak\nbut they are given power over the earth\". Now will you listen? Kill him!\nAnd if we don't? Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter.\n\nHe lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment. Nazgul\nlooks from one to the other of the elders. Nobody says a word but he can\nread their grim expressions. He turns to Drek -\n\nNAZGUL\n\nKill him. Kill him with the sword and with fire. Kill himl\n\nTHE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL\n\nIt's a shining bright image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal\nit's a reflection. Aragorn's silver ornament has been polished to a\nbrilliant luster. It's fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking\nthrough the bars high above the iron door.\n\nINSIDE THE CELL\n\nThe wooden bed has been smashed to pieces.\n\nBoth Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness\nthemselves so they can see through the bars. Aragorn controls the pole with\nthe \"mirror\" on the end of it.\n\nBy looking into it, Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door.\nHe has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it. He turns the pole,\nguiding the nail towards the keyhole. He's trying to pick the lock.\n\nWILL\n\nDo you understand time.., what time is it?\n\nAragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -\n\nARAGORN\n\nSeven hours since the rising of the sun.\n\nWILL\n\nJust after noon...\n\nARAGORN\n\nShouldn't we wait until night?\n\nWILL\n\n(concentrating)\n\nIf I'm right, it's gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think.\n\nThe nail is almost in the key-hole. Half an inch to go... a quarter. It\nslides off. Will curses and starts again -\n\nTHE SUN\n\nbeats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max\nand Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico. It's another entrance to\nthe Temple -one that opertl onto a central square. Orak and the two guards\nhurry across it. towards the slaughterhouu.\n\nTHE NAIL\n\nat the end of the pole slides into the keyhole. Will - barely breathing in\ncase it breaks his concentration - listens carefully. He moves the end of\nthe pole. The nail turns.\n\nHUGE SET OF DOORS\n\nare thrown open. Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and\nHannibal enter. Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and\nstomping their hooves -\n\nDRAK\n\nSomething's wrong!\n\n(turns to Max)\n\nGet the dogs.\n\nHANNIBAL\n\nmoves cautiously along the side one of the corrals, trying to see what's\nwrong with the horses. Behind him - a movement in the shadows.\n\nSswhish. The sound of something slicing through the air. He turns -\n\nIt's the side of Aragorn's hand. It chops hard into the ape's throat,\nshattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness. He crumples to\nthe ground.\n\nAragorn and Will strip him of his weapons. Will starts to go but Aragorn\ntears a strip off both their shirts. He ties the fabric around the ape's\nankles.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nARAGORN\n\nWatch - they're going to bring in the dogs.\n\nTHE DOGS\n\naren't really dogs at all - they're a much earlier ancestor. We call them\nwolves. There are two of them, on the end of heavy leather leashes. Their\nhandlers have them in Will's cell, rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses\nin front of their noses. The wolves take the scent.\n\nDrak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes. The wolves leap out of\nthe cell.\n\nHANNIBAL\n\nrises groggily to his feet, clutching his injured throat. He takes a few\nsteps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two wolves fly towards him. He tries\nto yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak.\n\nHe runs - the fabric, unseen by him, trails from his ankles. The wolves\npound after him. He glances over his shoulder. First one wolf - then the\nother - leaps.\n\nFangs and claws glistening, they hit him in the back, hurling him to the\nground. He writhes on to his back. One wolf tears at his ankles, the other\ngoes for his throat. Rip! Blood sprays as the artery breaks.\n\nA STONE PASSAGE-WAY\n\nWill and Aragorn are running, plunging down in to darkness. Arches and\ncorridors open off of it. It's like a labyrinth -\n\nWILL\n\nThis doesn't seem like the way out.\n\nARAGORN\n\nWe're not going out - not yet.\n\nWILL STOPS, GRABBING HOLD OF HIM, TURNING HIM ROUND -\n\nWILL\n\nSo what are we doing?\n\nARAGORN\n\n(softly)\n\nWe're going killing.\n\nWILL\n\nKilling?! Don't be stupid -\n\nWill jerks on Aragorn's arm, starting to haul him back. Aragorn throws off\nhis hand -\n\nARAGORN\n\nYou do what you like! But I'm the Ranger of the Easterlings -I won't leave\nhere until it's done.\n\nFrom behind them - the sounds of pursuit.\n\nWILL\n\nShit!\n\nHe starts to run. Together they disappear into the gloom ahead.\n\nROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS\n\nWill and Aragorn glide past them. They're taking it slowly, very carefully.\n\nNow we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors. Torches on either\nside illuminate a guard post but there's no sign of the sentry.\n\nWill and Aragorn move closer. They pass -\n\nCREVICE IN THE ROCK\n\nWe hold on the narrow opening, looking deep into the shadows. A big ape,\nheavily armed, stands there. He has his back to us, his legs spread. A\ntrickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - he's taking a piss. A\nshadow flickers on the wall above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore\nshadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight. The steel doors\nare straight ahead.\n\nThe sentry slides out of the crevice - he's behind Will. Silently, back\npressed again6t the bars of a cell, he creeps closer to Will. He has a\ncurved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other. Closer...\ncloser.\n\nHe raises the spear - a rustle of movement. Will spins - he sees the spear\nabout to thrust. He's a dead man.\n\nAn arm? It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the\nsentry's throat, half choking him.\n\nWill leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentry's jaw.\nThe sentry crumples to the ground, revealing the face of the prisoner. It's\nnot a man, though -it's an ape. He's in his prime - barrel chested and a\nfine head. His name is STRIDER.\n\nHe and Will look at each other through the bars.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nTwo rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never,\nwhatever else you do, turn your back on an ape.\n\nWill stares at him. Strider grins. Will smiles back -\n\nWILL\n\nThanks. I'll remember that.\n\nHe starts to search the sentry.\n\nARAGORN\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWILL\n\nLooking for the keys.\n\nARAGORN\n\nNo!\n\nWILL\n\nHe saved our lives.\n\nARAGORN\n\nHe's an ape!\n\nWill shrugs himself free of Aragorn's hand -\n\nWILL\n\nYou go and kill as many apes as you like - I'm setting this one free.\n\nAragorn looks at him. A beat.\n\nARAGORN\n\n(softly)\n\nIt's not apes I'm going to kill.\n\nA PRISON LABORATORY\n\nThe heavy steel doors stand open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room -\nsinks and instruments along a wall, a series of operating tables and a row\nof cages.\n\nBehind the bars are six tribes-people - men, women and a little boy. All of\nthem carry surgical scars on their heads. It's made two of them blind; the\nothers stare blankly into space.\n\nAragorn moves down the cages. Several of them shuffle towards him but\nthere's no recognition - they're like the walking dead. Aragorn doesn't say\na word. Grim-faced, he loads the crossbow and starts to fire, killing them.\n\nWill and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from\ncage to cage. Will steps forward, going to stop him. Strider's hand grabs\nhis shoulder, restraining him.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nLeave it. He knows what he's doing.\n\nWill turns and looks at him, questioning.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nThe doctors operate on them - up here.\n\n(taps his head)\n\nThe tribes think that we steal their souls...\n\n(he pauses - softly)\n\nMaybe they're right.\n\nAragorn reaches the last cage. A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle\nof the cell, looking at him. Aragorn stares at her face. His lip trembles\nwith emotion. She tilts her head on one side, as if trying to work\nsomething out. Tears fill Aragorn's eyes. She stumbles a step forward. The\nRanger closes his eyes. He pulls the trigger. A crossbow bolt slams into\nher chest and she falls.\n\nWill leans against the doorway, unwilling to watch, staring down the\npassageway. He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them. His voice is\nhollow, as if something has died within him -\n\nARAGORN\n\nIt's done. We can go now.\n\nHe turns and leads them back down the passageway.\n\nTHE WOLVES\n\nThere's five of them now, hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack.\nAll around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and\ncrannies. The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.\n\nWill, Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral, smearing\ntheir bodies with horse manure.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThe fresher the better. Cover everything -that's the only way you'll hide\nyour scent.\n\nThe wolves sniff the air, coming closer. Will, staring through the rungs of\nthe coral, sees their gleaming eyes coming closer. He raises his crossbow,\ngetting ready.\n\nThe wolves stop. They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is\ngrowing dark. A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside\nworld.\n\nThe horses rear and buck. The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the\nmiddle of the day. The wolves hackles rise in fear. They howl.\n\nAragorn and Strider are cowering back\n\nARAGORN\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWILL\n\nCome on! Now!\n\nHe drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses.\n\nAN UNEARTHLY LIGHT\n\nhas fallen on the city. The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers\nare running, children are screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is\nbolting down the terraces.\n\nThe darkness grows ever deeper. In the sky, the face of the moon\nobliterates the sun - it's a full solar eclipse.\n\nTwo horses, flying at a gallop, charge through the doors of the\nslaughterhouse. Will is on one, Aragorn clinging to his back. Strider is on\nthe other. They wheel across an open space, through running apes, and speed\ndown a terrace.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nsteps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a staff in one hand, his cloak\nthrown back over his shoulder, magnificent in the eerie light. He stares\ndown at the chaos. Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -\n\nDRAK\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMA-GOG\n\n(wild)\n\nA sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God! Lookl He points to\na terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to\nthe iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.\n\nOut of the blackness, an image -\n\nCHRIST ON THE CROSS\n\nIt's a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar\nconducting Mass for the repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny\nwhite coffin - just big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin.\nAnd another - a row of them.\n\nPRIEST\n\nAnd even now as sorrow has no end, we find comfort in the words of the Lord\nJesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark -\"suffer the little children to come\nunto me, for they are the Kingdom of Heaven. Now and forever.\" Amen.\n\nThe congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews.\n\nCONGREGATION\n\nAmen.\n\nPall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins. The organ starts to play. A soloist\n- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar. He starts to sing the Latin hymn\n\"Penis Angelicas\". The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral. They\ncarry over to -\n\nTHE SPACE DOME\n\nis lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day. The clock tower\nabove the biology building shows the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles\nwith activity.\n\nINSIDE THE DOME\n\nAn illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the\nPentagon's war room. Every research center is identified - next to it is\nits function and a list of personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas\nA&M, Los Alamos. Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the\nUniversity of Beijing...\n\nBelow the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers. We track through\nteams of men and women processing data, satellite dishes feeding a\ncommunications network, a video conference taking place in a corner,\ntechnicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes.\n\nWe come to a glass wall. On the other side is Diamond -\n\nA SMALL OFFICE\n\nGlass doors seal out the electronic hum. Diamond, staring through the\nglass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits on a couch. He's in his\nshirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes. Next to him is Bob, the young\nneurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt. On the front it says\n\n\"I'll sleep when I'm dead.\"\n\nThe coffee table is piled with files, journal extracts and computer\nprint-outs. A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a\nscreen.\n\nDiamond rubs her eyes, trying to wipe away the fatigue.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI'm sorry Luc - say that again.\n\nDEMAUPASSANT\n\nDEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)\n\n(kindly)\n\nMy fault, Billie - I rattle on too much. The result is - we've fixed the\ntime frame.\n\nHe hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the\nwomb appears on the screen... deMAUPASSANT\n\nThe fetus develops normally through the first trimester. Then it happens -\nabout sixteen weeks and two days, everything falls apart. The whole\nchemical structure goes out of control -\n\nHe flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably.\ndeMAUPASSANT\n\nOnce it starts, it's irreversible. If we're going to stop it, we've got to\nintercede here -\n\nHe points at the slide of the normally developing fetus.\n\nBOB\n\n(taking over)\n\nThere's a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned. That's what I've\nbeen working on. It's definitely in the mDNA. There's a fragment of one\nchromosome I'm looking at -\n\nHe flicks a switch on the video projector. A slide of a human gene,\nmassively magnified, popl on to the screen.\n\nBOB (CONT'D)\n\nIt's so different, I call it the alien. How it got there, exactly what it\ndoes - I haven't got the first idea.., no fucking idea at all.\n\nDiamond looks at his grim face. He seems totally defeated.\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(quietly)\n\nIs it that bad?\n\nHe stares at the floor. There's not even a hint of the former arrogance.\n\nBOB\n\nSomeone's dropped us in the middle of the Louvre. We're blind men and\nthey've told us to find the Mona Lisa. There's four miles of galleries end\nwe've got five minutes to do it. That's how I feel -and that's when rm\noptimistic.\n\nDiamond turns to deMaupassant.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nLuc?\n\nDEMAUPASSANT\n\nI'm sixty-two years old. I've seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon.\nIn my life I've won all the glittering prizes. I've always believed nothing\nwas beyond the reach of Man, but I'll tell you honestly - this may never be\nunraveled. If it is, it won't be in my lifetime.\n\nHe looks at them. Silence. There's nothing anyone can say. He starts to\ngather up his papers-\n\nDEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)\n\nSo what do we do? I think it's like Gatsby -\"so we beat on, boats against\nthe current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\" There's no other way,\nia there?\n\nThey nod their hoods - you have to try. DeMaupaasant and Bob start to\nleave.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nLuc?\n\n(he turns))\n\nYou're certain - about the time, I mean?\n\nDEMAUPASSANT\n\n(Nodding)\n\nSixteen weeks. How far along are you?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nTwelve weeks.\n\nThey look at one another. The old man speaks gently -\n\nDEMAUPASSANT\n\nGood night, Billie.\n\nA TINY FETUS\n\nperfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid. It's alive - the large\nhead sways, the heart beats through the translucent ribs.\n\nDiamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs. She\nlies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room. A complex\narray of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed\nstomach. It projects a , video image onto a screen.\n\nShe is alone in the room, manipulating the equipment herself. She stares up\nat the child growing in her womb. We see the genitalia.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nSo - you're a little boy. It's funny - I think I knew.\n\nShe reaches up and gently touches the image of his face.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nWe've got four weeks. The way I see it -there's nothing to lose. I can't\ntell you whet'Il happen to us. It's on the edge, mister. The air's so thin\nout there, we may not even be able to breathe. But what the hell - it's a\nchance.\n\nShe takes her hand away and looks at his face.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nYou want to try it? Sure you do. You're my son. We've waited all our lives\nfor each other.\n\nA STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS\n\nlie on a table in the basement. We track through them - past computer\nprint-outs and dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will's\ndetailed notes.\n\nTo the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes. In the\ndim light we see Diamond. She removes the catheter from her vein, turns and\nclimbs up the flotation tank.\n\nINSIDE THE TANK\n\nWater sloshes back and forth. Diamond lowers herself in and floats there.\nFor a moment, she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the\nhatch. We hold on her face.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\n(softly)\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current.\n\nShe reaches up and pulls the hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.\n\nTHE SUN AND THE MOON\n\nIt's one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the\nsky together. Smoke drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -\n\nA column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the\nslaughterhouse.\n\nRED HOT FIRE\n\nburns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse. The rickety\nconveyor belt is working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw the\nbodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt.\n\nThe body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt. It dumps him into\nthe furnace. The flames engulf him.\n\nWILL'S EMPTY CELL\n\nThe door hangs open. The space is lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone,\nmoving around the cell, trying to work out how Will escaped. He looks at\nthe smashed bed, the hole in the wall, the torn clothing that made the\nharness.\n\nHe swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock. No answers\nthere. Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end.\nDrak picks it up. He turns it over in his hand, th!nking about it.\n\nHe jumps! One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door.\nEffortlessly, he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars. The\nnail touches the lock.\n\nDRAK\n\n(to himself)\n\nClever... you clever fucking animal.\n\nDOCTOR ZORA (O.S.)\n\nMy lord...\n\nHe turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him.\n\nDOCTOR ZORA (CONT'D)\n\n(urgent)\n\nCould I see you please?\n\nTHE HALL OF POWER\n\nis a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge\npots. At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight.\nSilhouetted against it, commanding a view of the entire city, is the\nCouncil of Elders. They sit around a table made from bone and tusks, deep\nin discussion.\n\nNazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nDrak. I was just saying - maybe it's a blessing.\n\nDRAK\n\nA blessing?\n\nNAZGUL\n\nWhere there's one, there must be others. If we'd killed him, we might never\nfind them.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nBut the animal's not stupid - he knows come day-break we'll be tracking\nhim. Who's to say he'll run for home?\n\nDrak stops in front of them.\n\nDRAK\n\nNo - he's not stupid. But even dogs hunt in packs of seven. Every animal\nneeds its kind. And when we find them - what then?\n\nMA-GOG\n\nWhat do you think?!\n\nDRAK\n\nJust like the tribes - burn them out of their holes, put them to the sword?\nI don't mind doing that - I like it - but it's never enough, is it? No\nmatter how many we kill, every year they're still here. Why will it be any\ndifferent with the Blue Eyes? What we need is a final solution.\n\nNAZGUL And where do we find that?\n\nDRAK (CONT'D)\n\nDoctor Zora's brought back patients from a place called Kismatu. I've been\ntalking to her about it -\n\nSeveral of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nWhat is Kismatu?\n\nNAZGUL\n\nIt's a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier. Females and\nbabies have been dying there.\n\nHe turns to Drak - his eyes intense, very interested.\n\nNAZGUL (CONT'D)\n\nGo on.\n\nCOOL AND LOVELY ROOM\n\nThere are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the\nroom is a jungle-gym. Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on\ncots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end\nbodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.\n\nA double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign\n\n\"Quarantine. No Entry\".\n\nDrak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is\nwith them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.\n\nDOCTOR ZORA\n\nWe don't know what causes it- a virus probably. I'd hoped to complete our\nresearch before I came to you with my proposal. But, given the\ncircumstances -\n\nNAZGUL I\n\nIt's a brilliant idea.\n\n(turns and smiles at her)\n\nBrilliant.\n\nHORSES' HOOVES\n\npaw the ground. They're bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It's\nnight -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.\n\nWill and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire. Aragorn sits\nwell apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest,\nlost in his thoughts. Will and Strider look at him.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nHe's their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain. He has to\ndo what he thinks is right.\n\nWILL\n\n(hard)\n\nBy killing them?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nDon't judge him, Will. I couldn't have done it. I wonder if you could? One\nof those women he just killed wes his daughter.\n\nWill reacts. He turns and stares at the silhouette. A long beat.\n\nWILL\n\n(quietly)\n\nWe call it a Iobotomy. What other things have you people tried?\n\nHe turns to face him. Strider shrugs. There's something about it -\nsomething almost evasive.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nFuck you, Strider! Tell me!\n\nHe stares at Will - he's never seen him angry.\n\nSTRIDER\n\ndon't know if it's true.., my sister's mate works in the lab. He says\nDoctor Zora's working on some disease -\n\nWill comes towards him -\n\nWILL\n\nWhat sort of disease?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nOf the children, I think - ape children.\n\nWILL\n\nHow did they die, Strider? Old in the belly -is that how?!\n\nSTRIDER\n\nSome of them. You know this disease?\n\nWill stares at him, taking it in.\n\nWILL\n\n(softly)\n\nSo that's how it happened. Fuck you people.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThey haven't done it yet. It may not work.\n\nWILL\n\nThey will and it does.\n\nHe turns end takes step towards the forest. He runs his fingers through his\nhair -WILL God help us.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThat's funny - that's exactly what an ape would say.\n\nWill turns. He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man, both\nstruck by the sudden commonality.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nI'm sorry...\n\nWill walks slowly back to the fire. Strider starts to strip the meat off a\nhare he's roasting over the flames. He offers it to Will. He shakes his\nhead - he's not hungry anymore. He stares into the flames -\n\nWILL\n\nWhat about you, Strider - why were you in the cell?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nI fought another ape. Nothing very heroic, I'm afraid - I was drunk. He\nfell badly, his head hit the branch of a tree going down. It broke his\nneck.\n\nHe pauses We're not like humans. An ape never kills one of his own. Never.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat's the punishment?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nAt the ceremony of summer rites, the high priest would curse me with death.\n\nI would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall,\nno-one to say the sacred words. Without that, no ape can walk in the next\nworld. You saved my life, Will and I'm grateful. But there's nothing I can\ndo about my soul. I'm a dead ape walking.\n\nStrider stripe more meet off the hare. Will picks up a saddle and blanket\nand starts to make himself bed.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nYou knew, didn't you? You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon.\nThat's why you weren't afraid.\n\nWill pauses - then he turns to him.\n\nWILL\n\nYes - I knew.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nWHO ARE YOU, WILL?\n\nWILL\n\nI've come a long way, Strider - it's farther then I can explain.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nI've heard stories - old apes tell them 'round the fire late at night - of\nstrange lands where the creatures can tell the future. Is that where you're\nfrom?\n\nWILL\n\nIn a way.. yeah, it's something like that.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nSo what happens to it afl, to the world we've built? Tell me that.\n\nWILL\n\nIt passes away.\n\nStrider stares at him through the firelight.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nHistory remembers, though - it's passed on, what we did, I mean?\n\nWILL\n\nNo, Strider - there's nothing, not a trace left behind.\n\nStrider thinks for a moment, then he smiles gently.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nSo it's just vanity then - what we believe, that the works of the ape will\nlast forever?\n\nWILL\n\nYes, it's vanity. But not just of apes, Strider -maybe of men, too.\n\nHe turns and settles down on his makeshift bed. Strider - the food\nforgotten - stares out into the night. A million stars hang on a velvet\nsky.\n\nLook down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest, one tiny\nlightthe flickering fire.\n\nDUST SWIRLING, HOOVES POUNDING\n\nbattalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across\nthe city. Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as\nit rides out.\n\nAt its head is Drak. He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down\nthe avenue of idols. Votive fires burn in front of every statue.\n\nA RAINBOW\n\narches across the end of a tiny gorge. Dozens of streams cascade into\npools, spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and\nStrider along a hidden, path - a rock ledge that runs behind the\nwaterfalls.\n\nThe ledge widens into a large cave. Sunlight streams through a veil of\ncascading water. Aragorn looks around - something's worrying him.\n\nARAGORN\n\nThis is the Rainbow Tribe's cave. They should be here.\n\nA STONE FIREPLACE\n\nAragorn places his hand on the circle of stones, feeling its warmth.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nThey left at the rising of the sun.\n\nHe moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and\npassage-ways. He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there, food in\nbaskets.\n\nARAGORN\n\n(softly)\n\nWhy such hurry?\n\nSuddenly he stops, listening. He looks at Strider -\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nYou heard it?\n\nStrider nods his head - yes. Will hasn't heard a thing. He listens hard -\nnothing.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nAnimal?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nI don't think so.\n\nStrider moves silently to the side of the cave. He picks up a crossbow.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nIs there another entrance?\n\nARAGORN\n\nFrom the ridge above. Apes?\n\nSTRIDER\n\nScouts probably.\n\nHe cocks the crossbow. Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear. He moves\ntowards a cavern, signaling Strider to take a passageway.\n\nWill grabs a crossbow. Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor. They\nmove off.\n\nHONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES\n\neep in the cave. A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a\nflicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it,\nturns a corner and is lost in darkness.\n\nA CROSSROADS\n\nof arches and stalactites. Will and Strider split apart. Will moves\nsilently through the darkness, into a cavern. Through an archway he sees a\nshadow on the wall! He goes fast towards it -\n\nA HUGE BOULDER\n\nThe shadow comes round the boulder. We tilt down and now we see who's\nholding the torchDiamondl She's armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded.\nShe turns a corner -\n\nTen feet in front of her is Strider. She stares at the massive ape's back -\na bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder. Her eyes widen with fear.\nShe raises the crossbow -\n\nStrider hears it. He spins, weapon rising -\n\nturns into a passage midway between them. He sees Diamond about to fire. He\nscreams -\n\nToo late - she pulls the trigger! Will hurls himself forward - in front of\nStrider. Whack! The arrow blasts into his chest. He crashes to the ground.\n\nDiamond stares down at him.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWill!\n\nHis eyes open - he's gasping for breath from the impact. He and Diamond\nlook at one another. Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Will's\nchain mail armor. Diamond's shoulders sag with relief.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\n(indicates Strider Who's he?\n\nWILL\n\nI'll explain later.\n\nHe struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nWhat made you come? I thought the mDNA was just a theory. One of dozens of\ntheories - isn't that what you said?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.\n\nWILL\n\nPeople have been wrong about a lot of things.\n\nTHE GREAT VALLEY\n\nstretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and\nDiamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nThis is the rift valley in Kenya -\n\nHe points at the towering, snow-capped peak.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nThat's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years\nof wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -\nwe've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be\ndone, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space\nand time. How long has science dreamed of that?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHow long have you?\n\nWILL\n\nAll my life.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nDream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor\nRobert Plant of UC Berkeley.\n\nWILL turns and looks out at the valley -\n\nWILL\n\n(softly)\n\nYeah - I really have, haven't I?\n\nDiamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -\n\nSTRIDER (O.S.)\n\nAragorn - I've found it!\n\nA CAVE PAINTING\n\nNewly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will\nand Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight.\n\nARAGORN\n\nI thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a\ngathering of the Seven Tribes.\n\nWILL\n\nWhere?\n\nARAGORN\n\nTwo days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.\n\nHe looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nWe'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.\n\nTHE EMBERS OF A FIRE\n\nburn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.\nWill and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near\nthe entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nAn ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?\n\nWILL\n\nYou know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's\nall. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them\nskulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI guess there's a lesson in that.\n\nWILL\n\nListen, Billie - the apes have discovered a disease.\n\nDiamond reacts. Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small\nchain of circles. It's a molecule.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nIt's really rare and, lucky for them, it's in an isolated area. They're not\nstupid - they understand it's potential. They plan to give it to the tribes\n-\n\nHe draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nAnd maybe they do, but it doesn't matter -Aragorn's people aren't us.\nAlready evolution's taken another track -\n\nscratches a cross through the bow-legged man. He draws the figure of an\nupright human.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nSomewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWoman. You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman.\n\nShe reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figure's head.\n\nWILL\n\nYou're right. Sooner or later the apes find her. She doesn't look like the\ntribes but the apes don't care - she's human.\n\nSo they give her the disease. She's different though - it doesn't work, or\nat least it doesn't seem to. It gets integrated into her. It's passed on,\nit mutates, it weaves its way into the mDNA. It lies there - a bomb waiting\nto go off. And then one day -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nAfter a hundred thousand years?\n\nWILL\n\nThe planet's five billion years old. What's that to Nature? A blink of the\neye.\n\nWill throws the stick down on the ground.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nThat's the theory, anyway.\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(impressed)\n\nA helluva theory, Doctor Plant.\n\nHE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nThere's not much time, Will. We have to find her before the apes and we\nhave to do it within four weeks.\n\nWILL\n\nJesus, Billie! Four weeks? We've got a theory - that's all. We don't even\nknow half the problems we're dealing with. You can't put a deadline on\nscience.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nScience, Will? What about people? Isn't that what this is all about. I'm\nsorry - I thought there were children dying.\n\nWILL\n\nSure. Of course it's about that too.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nBut then, you don't care muchabout people do you?\n\nTHEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -\n\nWILL\n\nNo - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what\nmatter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nProgress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up\nto believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that\nmean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I\ncame? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a\nchild -that's why I'm here.\n\nThey look at one another.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nUke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with\nthem?\n\n(indicates Aragore and Strider)\n\nWe should cut ourselves loose.\n\nWILL\n\nWe wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like\nstorm-troopers.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nWILL\n\nRight behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he\ncan hear their hoof beats in his head.\n\nThe first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond\nturn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.\n\nARAGORN\n\nReady?\n\nA SPARKLING RIVER\n\nwinds through a beautiful valley. The two horses splash along the water's\nedge. Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the\nother. They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into\nthe forest.\n\nTHE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW\n\nApe soldiers are swarming over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study\nfootprints. He looks up at Orak -\n\nTRACKER\n\nThere's four of them, my Lord.\n\nDRAK\n\nFour? The Tracker points It a at of prints -\n\nTRACKER\n\nIt's woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.\n\nDRAK\n\nExcellent. I look forward to meeting her.\n\nSOLDIER (O.S.)\n\nMy Lord - hoof prints.\n\nDrak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of\nthe cave. Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight. It's\nanother entrance.\n\nDRAK\n\nMalakai! Bolag!\n\nTwo heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they\nrun for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing\ntiny ledges.\n\nOther apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.\n\nAN EAGLE CIRCLES\n\nSoaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in\nskins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a\nLOOKOUT. He tenses -\n\nFour figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The\nLookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -\n\nSERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS\n\nare built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by\nladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live\nwith their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.\n\nThe platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn\nat the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.\n\nTHE LOOKOUT POST\n\nKip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and\nDiamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.\n\nKIP\n\nIt's the traveler! With a woman...\n\nThe Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming\ncloser.\n\nLOOKOUT\n\nThe fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's\nhand falls on his arm, stopping him.\n\nKIP\n\nWho's the other one, though?\n\n(realizing)\n\nAragorn!\n\nHe turns, yelling down to the platforms -\n\nKIP (CONT'D)\n\nIt's the Ranger! The Ranger is free!\n\nON THE PLATFORMS\n\nThe tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges, scaling the\nladders.\n\nA WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR\n\nWhack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a\nprimitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.\n\nThe tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.\nA ripple of fear and anger runs through them.\n\nARAGORN\n\nThe ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.\n\nNobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior\nstarts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they\nembrace.\n\nWill crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -\n\nKIP\n\nYou carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.\n\nINSIDE THE EAGLE'S NEST\n\nA series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.\nThey're crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing,\nflint-knappers are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.\n\nA shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have\nfound a quiet place amid the bustle.\n\nWILL\n\nAre the seven tribes here?\n\nKIP\n\nAll except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have\nthe longest journey.\n\nWILL\n\nWill they come?\n\nKIP\n\nWho knows - maybe the apes have found them. Nobody has seen them for many\nsummers gone. Why?\n\nWILL\n\nI'm searching for someone - a young woman. She looks like us ...\n\n(he indicates Diamond))\n\nI thought she might live with the tribes.\n\nKIP\n\nIs she a relative - was she born to your hearth?\n\nWILL\n\nTo all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We think of her as the first\nwoman. Without her. our lives are nothing.\n\nKIP\n\n(nodding his head)\n\nWomen are of the spirit - we believe that. too. Mother Earth mates with the\ntotems. Only through woman can their children walk the world.\n\nWILL\n\nHave you seen her?\n\nKIP\n\nNO.\n\nWILL\n\nYou're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?\n\nKIP\n\nShe looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're\nthe ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure\nthey would have talked about it.\n\nWILL\n\nUgly?\n\nThey smile at one another.\n\nKIP\n\nI'm sorry I can't help.\n\nA torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty\nexcept for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders\nof each of the tribes.\n\nANOTHER TORCH IS LIT\n\nThey ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the\nfeathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the\nrainbow...\n\nBeneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the\nAntelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in\nceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to\nhis feet.\n\nARAGORN\n\nWe've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says\nit's an army.\n\nKIP\n\nAnd there are more coming from the north. Five squadrons et least, the\nrunners say. It's led by the old warrior Nazgul.\n\nARAGORN\n\nIs that why you called the gathering?\n\nKIP\n\nGreat things are moving, Ranger -\n\nAn old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the\nRainbow.\n\nA RAINBOW\n\nA stranger walks out of the west, the moon hides the sun, armies are on the\nmarch - come the new moon, nothing in Middle Earth will be the same.\n\nOthers nod their heads in agreement.\n\nKIP (CONT'D)\n\nWe either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide.\n\nARAGORN\n\nI know you, Kip - you always were a fighter. What do the others say?\n\nwarrior in a feathered cloak speaks -\n\nEAGLE\n\nIt doesn't matter what we say - the Ranger has returned. We'll follow\nwherever he leads.\n\nAragorn looks at their faces. Slowly he shakes his head -\n\nARAGORN\n\nI'll walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me, but I'll walk it no more\nas Ranger.\n\nThe leaders stare at him. Several start to object but he silences them with\nhis hand -\n\nARAGORN\n\nA man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine.\n\n(softly)\n\nI took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it. I did my\nduty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But now others must walk in my\nplace.\n\nHe walks forward, unfastening the Crescent of Light. He stops in front of\nKip -\n\nARAGORN\n\nIf I should have had a son, I would have hoped for a man as fine as you.\nThis is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-\n\nHe reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kip's neck.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nTake care of my father's people. Guide them well.\n\n(he looks at the leaders)\n\nYou must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me... I was the one that\nhad to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child. Tomorrow I\nwill go to fight them. What father could do any less?\n\nHe turns away and walks towards the entrance. Only Will sees the tears in\nhis eyes.\n\nKIDS' FACES, WIDE-EYED\n\nThey huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape.\nStrider is building a small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down\nfurs for sleeping. , She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the\nmeeting. Will approaches.\n\nWILL\n\nThey're going to war. They leave at dawn.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThey'll be slaughtered.\n\nWILL\n\nThey think if they leave the valley, their totems won't follow. Without\nthem, they say they're dead anyway.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe should go now.\n\nWill looks at her. She meets his gaze. Suddenly she realizes -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nOh, nol We're not fighting someone else's war -\n\nWILL\n\nListen to me -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet\nare we waiting for? Let's go!\n\nThe tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and\nguides her to a private corner -\n\nWILL\n\nListen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't\nharm the woman.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nBeat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What\nthen? Don't you understand? Four weeksi\n\nWILL\n\nYeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know\nthings the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it\nwith their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them\nboth. We can win!\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will\n- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst\n\nWILL\n\nLook -\n\nHe bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nTaste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The\ncaves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur\nall around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist\n- you know what it means.\n\nSure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIt's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks\nabout is weapons.\n\nWILL\n\nWe're a frail species, Billea. It's only weapons that have made us bigger\nthan we are.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nOr smaller.\n\nWILL\n\nIt's the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this. We can\nbeat themi No more experiments - no more problem.\n\nDIAMOND\n\n(quietly)\n\nI hope your right, Will.\n\nFIRES BURN\n\nall over the eagle's nest, turning piles of timber into charcoal. The camp\nis a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the\nvalley carrying piles of sulfur rock; women and children sit in circles,\npounding the saltpeter into dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders,\nwatching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls.\n\nStrider sits apart, watching, not sure if the humans have lost their minds.\n\nSTRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US\n\nHe looks like a scarecrow except he's dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged\nto a flying fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are\ngathered on the side of a crevasse, watching.\n\nThe straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop. Will touches a\nburning ember to the ground. We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but\nwe lose it among the rocks. A thin trail of smoke marks its passage.\n\nThe tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening. Suddenly - just as\nthe straw man reaches the outcrop -\n\nKa-boom! A huge explosion. Fire and flying rock hit the straw men.\n\nThe tribes-people scream. Terrified, they turn and run. Smoke and dust\nobscure the flying fox. Will walks forward to examine his handiwork.\n\nTribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear.\nThey see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope.\nSeveral of the women start to cry in fear.\n\nWill stands on the edge of the crevasse. He turns - Kip, Aragorn and the\nother leaders are approaching. They look at him with trepidation.\n\nKIP\n\nYou make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing?\n\nWILL\n\nGunpowder.\n\nKip turns to the others. They repeat the word, as if that will unlock its\nmystery.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nWe've still got work to do.\n\nHe turns and goes. The tribes-people, emboldened by their leaders, come\ncloser. They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them. He comes\nface to face with Strider. The man and the ape look at one another.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nApes believe men are the devil's children. Maybe they're right. What have\nyou done, Will - what have you unleashed on the world?\n\nWILL\n\nNothing, Strider. The future, that's all.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nI can't fight with you tomorrow, Will. To kill an ape in a brawl is one\nthing, but I can't go to war against my people.\n\nWILL\n\n(kindly)\n\nI never expected you to.\n\nAgain they look at one another. Will turns and leaves.\n\nWATER FLYING, HOOVES POUNDING\n\nDrak and his cavalry, pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river.\nRanks of infantry, followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.\n\nThe river swings around a point thick with trees. We crane up above the\nfoliage - a tributary flows clown the other side. Marching through the\nshallows is another army of apes. At their head, on a stallion, is Nazgul.\n\nThe two squadrons converge at the end of the point. The foot soldiers meld\ntogether, the Praetorian Guard splash ahead, Drak and Nazgul ride side by\nside. Ahead, the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge. It's\na natural weir -\n\nTHE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS\n\nA jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the\nriver. The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.\n\nThe Guard spur their horses forward, forcing them through the fast-running\ncurrent, crossing to the other side -\n\nIN THE TREES\n\nA shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the\nforest, almost invisible in skins and camouflage.\n\nWill and Kip stand motionless, deep in shadow. They watch as the Guard on\ntheir horses come thundering across the ford, straight towards them. The\ninfantry are close behind. Will drops his hand -\n\nTRAILS OF FIRE\n\nwhip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks\nthat form part of the ford. The Guards' horses shy away. The apes look down\nin puzzlement -\n\nBoom! Boom! Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water.\nApes are cut to pieces, horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water.\n\nOn the far side - Orak's horse rears up. He drives his spurs into its\nflanks, trying to control it. Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the\nweir, the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in\nconfusion.\n\nDrak plunges forward - chaos all around him. He pounds his chest with both\nfists and roars -\n\nDRAK\n\nApes - chargel\n\nThe apes still on their horses hear his cry. They spur their mounts\nforward. The first of the cavalry reach -\n\nTHE SHORE\n\nBoom... boom! More explosions rip the river bank to pieces.\n\nIN THE FOREST\n\nBatteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames. The\nEagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other, touching flames to\nrope fuses. Fire sizzles towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a\ncharge -\n\nBam...bam...bamf The scores of crossbows fire.\n\nON THE FORD\n\nThe ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail\nof arrows cut them to pieces.\n\nDrak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses. He looks\nthrough the smoke - into the forest. He sees Will, standing on a rock with\nKip, like a general commanding his army.\n\nDrak bellows with rage. He snaps the reins, about to drive his horse\nonward. An arrow flies in from the flank. Whackt It slams into Drak's chest\narmor, splintering. He turns -\n\nTHE JUMBLE OF LOGS\n\nfloats in the middle of the river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water\nstreaming off of him, kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading\nhis bow. This is no jumble of logs - it's a firing platform they've\nanchored therel\n\ndozen Rainbow warriors, hidden in the water, clamber out of the river. They\nkneel next to their leader, drlwing their bows -\n\nTHE FORD\n\nDrak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes.\nRight in front of him, an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of\nthe Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to Nazgul, yelling -\n\nDRAK\n\nThe ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the\nweir.\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nApe cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank. Bam! They hear the\ncharges go off - the hurl themselves down. Another volley of arrows scythes\nthrough them -\n\nIN THE FOREST\n\nThe Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the\nbatteries of crossbows. One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face.\n\nDrak, followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard, charge through the\nblue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them.\n\nOne of the crossbow batteries fires! Arrows hit his horse's armor but Drak\ndoesn't falter. Crouched Iow in the saddle, he spins the Gatling gun like a\ngunslinger. He locks it under his arm.\n\nThe eagle warriors start to break and run. The apes' horses sound like\nthunder rolling closer. The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand\ntheir ground, desperately working to reload.\n\nThey spin the battery, sighting straight at Drak's chest. They fire! Arrows\nfly -\n\nDrak leaps out of the saddle! He catches hold of an overhanging bough. The\narrows whiz underneath, skimming his butt. He leaps again - higher into the\ntree.\n\nThe Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves. It's dazzling\n-\n\nSmash! Drak's sword cleaves through one of the warriors. Drak has dropped\nto the ground, right behind them. The Eagle leader turns - too latel\nRat-a-tat-tat! The Gatling gun fires. Arrows shred the Eagle leader's\nfeathered coat. He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird.\n\nTHE FORD\n\nThe ape infantry pour across the ford, charging over the bodies of their\nfallen comrades.\n\nTHE FOREST\n\nRiderless horses, part of the ape cavalry, charge wildly through the trees.\nWe tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees. The\nbranches are thick with apes firing, cutting down groups of running\ntribesmen.\n\nTHE ROCK PLATFORM\n\nWill and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron\nbarrel wedged in the rocks. One of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at\nthe trees; another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.\n\nWill touches an ember to a fuse. Everyone dives for cover -\n\nBoom! The primitive cannon fires. The shrapnel hits the trees. Shredded\napes, branches and leaves fall to the ground.\n\nWill and the warriors reload. Again they fire - but the charge is too big.\nThe whole cannon breaks free of the rocks. It flies like a missile and\nsmashes into the trunk of a tree. Timber!\n\nA ROCKY GORGE\n\nIts rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group\nof warriors are fighting hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape\ninfantry.\n\nAragorn drives his spear at a huge ape. The point plunges into the animal's\nbelly, up and under his armor. Blood spurts out from the joins in the\nmetal.\n\nIN THE TREES\n\nAn ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He\nfires -\n\nAMONG THE BOULDERS\n\nWham! The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorn's shoulder, sending him\nreeling. One of the tribesmen turns - it's Kip. He sees Aragorn on his\nknees.\n\nKip wields a sword, fighting his way towards Aragorn. Slash! He takes one\nape across the chest. Whaml Another ape in the neck. He grabs Aragorn and\nstarts to drag him out of the melee.\n\nIN THE TREES\n\nThe ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights. His finger reaches for the\ntrigger. He starts to squeeze -\n\nSswhishl The sound of an arrow. Whackl It buries itself in the\nsharpshooter's neck. He falls out of the tree -\n\nHIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS\n\nWill. He stands almost at the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He\nlooks down at Kip's men - the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are\nswarming forward, driving the tribesmen back.\n\nOn a ridge below him, four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder. A\nflash of fire then - Ka-bam!\n\nON THEGROUND\n\nApes are rushing forward. They hear the explosion. Several apes turn - the\nhuge boulder, split into chunks, flies towards them. The apes scatter.\nSmashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles.\n\nBut there's more of them behind, spilling in to the gorge, over-running it\n-\n\nTHE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION\n\nswirls past Drak. He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted\nagainst the sky.\n\nDrak snarls deep in his throat. He wheels his horse and gallops hard\ntowards a trail that winds up among the boulders.\n\nON THE RIDGE\n\nWill moves fast along the top of the ridge. He stops - looking down on the\nriver. On the other side, Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather\nbladders from the wagons and empty them into the river.\n\nWill shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors. He\nrealizes - it's oil.\n\nThe current carries it straight towards the platform in the river. The\nwarriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard, firing at the\napes on the ford.\n\nWill turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline. He sees what he feared -\ntwo apes below him with a fire burning. They slot flaming arrows into their\ncrossbows -\n\nWill unslings his crossbow, steadies himself and fires -\n\nKs-whack! The arrow rips through one ape's neck. He pitches forward -\nheed-first into the fire. The other ape hurls himself aside, diving for\ncover.\n\nWill re-loads. The side of the ape's head is just visible behind a rock. If\nWill makes this, it's going to be a helluva shot.\n\nHis finger curls around the trigger - right behind him, the sound of\nhooves. Will spins\n\nit's Drak charging towards him. He raises the Gatling gun -\n\nWill aims at the big ape's throat and fires.\n\nDrak swerves. The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed\nforearm. The Gatling gun flies from his hand.\n\nThere's no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs.\n\nDrak charges down on him. He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard.\n\nWill scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air!\n\nDrak has him square in his sights. He draws back his arm, about to hurl the\nharpoon. Will throws himself forward -\n\nTHE SIDE OF A CLIFF\n\nWill falls down, down, down.\n\nDrak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge. He looks over - Will\nplunges towards the river, flowing fast below the ford.\n\nSplash! Will cannonballs into the water and disappears. Drak stares down,\ntrying to catch sight of him. Nothing.\n\nIN THE RIVER\n\nA tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current.\nA pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it. Will's head\nfollows.\n\nGasping, catching his breath, he looks upstream - the water pours over the\nweir. A flaming arrow arcs through the air. The ape on the shore has done\nhis job -\n\nTHE OIL SLICK\n\nerupts in flames as the arrow hits it. The whole surface of the river is\nsuddenly transformed into a raging blaze.\n\nThe Rainbow leader and his men turn. They see a wall of flame racing\ntowards them. Several warriors dive into the water, swimming for the shore\n-\n\nWhoosh! The flames engulf them. A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden\nplatform. Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying\nwarriors.\n\nIN THE RIVER\n\nThe current pulls Will down the river. He looks back - the molten fire\nspills over the weir. Anguished screams are carried on the wind. A pillar\nof black, oily smoke rises up high into the sky -\n\nTHE EAGLES' NEST\n\nThe platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women, children and\nold folks. Diamond and Strider stand together. All of them stare down at\nthe river valley. The pillar of smoke rises higher.\n\nWOMAN (O.S.)\n\nThey're here!\n\nDiamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform. Diamond\nfollows the direction of her outstretched arm.\n\nA group of warriors, followed by their women-folk and children, are coming\nround the mountain path. Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress\nof auroch's horns. It's the Tribe of the Antelope.\n\nOUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE\n\nA chorus of chattering voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members\nof their sister tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center,\nlistening to a woman -Kip's wife. Whatever she's saying is lost in the\nhubbub.\n\nANTELOPE\n\nQuiet!\n\nInstantly, the voices die.\n\nANTELOPE (CONT'D)\n\n(anxious)\n\nWhere?\n\nKip's wife doesn't answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of\nsmoke. The Antelope leader turns to his warriors.\n\nANTELOPE (CONT'D)\n\nWe go - now!\n\nDIAMOND AND STRIDER\n\nstand on the platform, watching several old men lower the drawbridge.\nWhack! It locks into place. The antelope warriors cross it and disappear\ndown a narrow trail.\n\nThe rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave. Diamond turns away -\nthen she stops. Something has caught her eye. She stares at the crowd of\nwomen and children heading into the cave.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nWhat is it?\n\nDiamond doesn't answer - she tenses. In the milling crowd of brown bodies,\nshe sees it again - a flash of gold. It*s sunlight on blonde hair.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nShe's here.., holy God - she's herel It's not a woman - it's a child!\n\nShe grabs a rope ladder, ignores the rungs and slithers down it.\n\nA YOUNG GIRL\n\nhelps her mother set up camp. She is about 10 years old, tawny-haired,\ntaller and straighter-backed'than any of her people. She looks like us.\n\nDiamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth. She\nstops. The young girl turns. For a moment she and Diamond stare at one\nanother, separated by a hundred thousand years, but so similar they can\nboth see themselves in the other.\n\nTHE YOUNG GIRL SMILES. DIAMOND RETURNS IT -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat's your name?\n\nThe girl's mother stares, amazed to see someone who looks like her child.\n\nMOTHER\n\nHer name is Aiv.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nEv?\n\n(Realizing)\n\nOf course. My people have a name like that - \"Eve\" is how we say it.\n\nThe mother nods - the sound seems to please her. Diamond puts out her arms\nand indicates the young girl. The mother smiles, giving her permission.\nDiamond puts her arms around Eve.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\n(softly)\n\nI've come a long way to find you.\n\nEve looks at her - wide-eyed, innocent.\n\nEVE\n\nWhy?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nTo keep you safe.\n\nShe holds her tight. The mother catches Diamond's eye.\n\nMOTHER\n\nDo you have children?\n\nDiamond shakes her head - no. The mother can't hide her disappointment.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nMOTHER\n\nI was hoping you had a son. Aiv's a sweet girl. She's the child of my\nheart. But the way she looks, nobody will want her as a mate.\n\nBefore Diamond can answer there's a commotion outside the cave. She turns\nto look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight.\n\nSWIRLS OF DUST\n\nrise up from I mountain path. Whatever's causing it is hidden from view by\nthe peaks and crags. The tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching\nit come closer. Strider cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes\nacross his face.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nHorses! It's horses!\n\nHorses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people. Women grab their\nchildren, young kids start screaming, old men and boys scramble for\nweapons.\n\nDiamond weaves through the flying mass of people. She swings up on to a\nplatform beside Strider. He points -\n\nComing into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling, dragging\ntheir wounded - are what's left of the Antelope warriors.\n\nTheir women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates.\nThe warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge. Nobody raised\nit when they left -\n\nSeveral old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it. They haul on\nthe ropes and pulleys. It starts to swing upwards -\n\nHere he comes - Drak! He's galloping hard at the head of his cavalry,\nbattle scarred and bloodied. He sees the drawbridge starting to lift. He\ndoesn't pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop.\n\nThe bridge rises higher. Drak's horse leaps! It soars across the crevasse -\nthe giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge.\n\nThe men and boys stare in horror. Orak charges down on them. They back away\n-all except one boy, not even in his teens, who stands his ground.\n\nSwish! Drak's sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist. The other tribesmen\nrun. Wham! The drawbridge falls back into place. The ape cavalry charge\nacross it.\n\nBROAD WOODEN PLATFORM\n\nAn ape horseman flies across the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a\nlower platform. Diamond's right in front of him!\n\nShe throws herself aside, grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -\n\nA ROCK SHELF\n\nShe looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere,\nweapons flashing, people screaming.\n\nA young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - it's Gray Beard. The young\nboy hasn't got a chance. Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip.\n\nIt curls around the boy's ankle, tripping him. The boy looks up - he tries\nto shield his face. Too late! The horse's hooves smash down -\n\nDiamond looks away, unable to watch. She sees Eve. The young girl is at the\nfront of the cave, spinning in panic. Her mother runs towards her...\n\nThe mother doesn't see Gray Beard galloping towards her. Diamond screams a\nwarning but it's just one more crv in the commotion.\n\nGray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin. It\nhits the mother in the small of the back, straight through the spine. She\npitches forward - dead. Eve screams and runs towards her mother.\n\nDiamond leaps off the rock ledge -\n\nIN FRONT OF THE CAVE\n\nDiamond runs faster than she's ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels\nhis horse - he sees Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the\nBlue Eyes! And a woman! He leaps his horse forward -\n\nDRAK\n\nGrab the female!\n\nGray Beard is off his horse. Diamond runs towards him. He raises a\ncrossbow...\n\nDrak charges down on her from behind. He holds the harpoon at his shoulder.\nHe aims at her legs.\n\nDiamond races on - her only thought, to save Eve. It'll never happen -\nshe's as good as deadGray Beard's in front, aiming. Drak's right behind. He\nhurls the harpoon.\n\nWhoosh! Strider swings through the air. He clings to one of the rope\nladders - it's like Tarzan, except he's an ape. He grabs Diamond by the\nscruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way.\n\nDrak's harpoon skims past them. Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman\nflying through the air. But that's not his big surprise - with Diamond out\nof the way, the harpoon is flying straight at him. He screams as it rips\ninto his throat.\n\nHIGH ROCK LEDGE\n\nStrider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the\nfight. Diamond turns fast and looks back -\n\nIN FRONT OF THE CAVE\n\nEve crouches over the body of her mother. The woman's mouth is frozen in an\nanguished scream, her dead eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her,\ndesperately hoping for some sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.\n\nA dark shadow falls across her. She looks up - it's Drak. He reaches down\nand grabs her by the neck. He beats his chest with his fist and raises her\nup above his head like a trophy.\n\nON THE ROCK LEDGE\n\nDiamond, anguished, tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in\nan iron grip. He swings Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging\nbranch of a tree. He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from\nsight.\n\nCHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE\n\nfloats at the shore of the river. It is what remains of the firing platform\n- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.\n\nSmoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest. The only\nsound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg. Again and again it\ntries to get to its feet.\n\nA solitary figure makes his way through the shadows. It's Will, soaking wet\nfrom the river. He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at\nthe carnage all around him. So much for knowledge and science. This is\nwhere the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie\nhuddled together in a jumble.\n\nWill stares at them, anguish on his face.\n\nWILL\n\n(softly, to himself)\n\nI was so sure...\n\nHe kneels and turns one of the bodies over. It's Kip - speared through the\nchest. A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light. It glints on his\nlifeless throat. Gently, he closes Kip's glassy eyes.\n\nsound behind him. Will hurls himself aside, grabbing for a weapon. He looks\nup -it's the Lookout, battle-stained and weary. Their eyes meet -\n\nLOOKOUT\n\n(quietly)\n\nYou said we'd win.\n\nWill just nods - he knows.\n\nLOOKOUT (CONT'D)\n\nYou gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing.\n\nThe Lookout kneels and crosses Kip's hands across his chest. He reaches\ndown and removes the Crescent of Light. He turns to Will -\n\nLOOKOUT (CONT'D)\n\nGet the weapons you need. The apes'Il be coming back for their dead. Hurry!\n\nWill arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies.\n\nCLOUDS OF SMOKE\n\nrise into the sky - the eagle's nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make\ntheir way along a narrow mountain trail - they've put the humans' camp to\nthe torch.\n\nWith them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly, many of\nthem in tears. They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and\ndying. We crane, up to -\n\nHUGE ROCK OVERHANG\n\nhigh up the mountain-side. Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are\nDiamond and Strider. They look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees\nEve.\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN TRAIL\n\nThe young girl stumbles along the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak's\nsaddle. She's bruised and bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to\nwalk.\n\nTHE ROCK OVERHANG\n\nDiamond looks at her, close to tears, but there's nothing she can do. She\nwatches the convoy wind along the trail.\n\nBoomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips\nthrough the eagle's nest, blowing out the side of one of the peaks. Diamond\nwatches the dust climb into the sky. All her hopes seem to be going with\nit.\n\nIN THE RIVER\n\nIt's twilight. Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that\nprotects one end of a tiny beach.\n\nWill sees a fire burning on the sand, a cave opening off the beach, piles\nof stones like burial mounds.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat is this place?\n\nLOOKOUT\n\nIt's called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - it's where our forefathers\nare laid to rest. It's sacred to us - anyone who's still alive will make\ntheir way here.\n\nThey wade closer to the beach. In the firelight they see groups of\ntribesmen -survivors of the battle. Women and children - the lucky few who\nmanaged to flee the eagle's nest - are binding the warriors' wounds.\n\nThey look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will. As he comes\ncloser he recognizes a woman, sitting alone -\n\nWILL\n\nIt's Kip's wife. She's come from\n\nTHE EAGLE'S NEST -\n\nHe goes towards her, passing the other tribes-people. Nobody greets him.\nThey just watch him pass. He stops in front of Kip's wife. Her eyes are red\nfrom crying.\n\nWILL\n\nrm sorry about your mate.\n\nShe says nothing - she just stares at him. Will keeps going -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nI've been to the eagle's nest. I was looking for the woman I was with. We\nsearched but...\n\n(he pauses)\n\nWhat happened - was she captured?\n\nKIP'S WIFE\n\nI threw myself off a platform. I don't know what happened to anyone.\n\nWill nods. He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire. We\ndon't hear what he says, but we know what he is asking. One after another\nthey shake their heads - no, they know nothing of Diamond.\n\nSHAFT OF MOONLIGHT\n\nshimmers on the water. Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water.\nHis face is grim, his heart heavy with grief. He's making something with\nhis hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we can't see\nwhat it is.\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE\n\nA shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their\nend - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in\ntheir shadow.\n\nOLD MAN\n\nIt's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -\nwe are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the\nfield. We must decide ourselves what to do.\n\nSilence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for\ndiscussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -\n\nWOUNDED WARRIOR\n\nLike you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle\nEarth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.\n\nA young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n\nLeave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody\ncan live without their totem - we all know that!\n\nLOOKOUT\n\nNobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we\ntravel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe\nour totems will follow us?\n\nThere's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their\nheads.\n\nTHE BEACH\n\nNow we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and\nleaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it\nin the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it\nbobs out into the river -\n\nWILL\n\n(softly)\n\nI'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you\nwanted was a baby...\n\nHe can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.\n\nIN THE RIVER\n\nThe current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches\nout and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -\nit's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.\nHe hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -\n\nSTRIDER\n\nIt looks like someone made it.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIt's a boat - it's gaff-rigged.\n\n(realizing)\n\nOh, Jesus...\n\nShe plunges forward, wading as fast as she can.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nWill!\n\nON THE BEACH\n\nWill is walking up the beach. He stops, listening. He hears it again -his\nname! He turns and heads towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round\nthe headland, splashing through the water.\n\nWill stops. They look at one another - then they both move forward, arms\nstretching out. They wrap their arms around each other.\n\nWILL\n\n(softly)\n\nI thought I'd lost you.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI thought you were dead.\n\nThey keep holding each other.\n\nWILL\n\nHow did you find this place?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nStrider. His father was a tracker. We've been following a trail for hours.\n\nWill looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nHe saved my life, Will.\n\nWill goes to greet him. The man and the ape embrace.\n\nWILL\n\nThank you, my friend - thank you.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nWhat did you expect? You would have done the same for me.\n\nSHOWER OF SPARKS\n\nas Will puts a log on the fire. From inside the cave we hear the murmur of\nvoices as the argument goes back and forth.\n\nBoth Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out\nnext to the fire, drying. Will speaks to Diamond -\n\nWILL\n\nSome times when we want something so bad, we can take a thing and twist it\nin our head. You're sure about this, Billie?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI'm pregnant, Will - I'm not crazy. She's not like them - she's a mutation.\nEvolution's always trying to improve on itself. It's turned out a child\nthat can walk taller and run faster, one whose brain-pan holds a mind that\ncan think laterally. I've seen her, Will. I've held her in my arms - she\nwas us.\n\nWill looks at her. There's no doubt - he believes her.\n\nWILL\n\nYou said she was with Drak.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nOn a chain.\n\nWILL\n\nIt's two days' march to the city. Was she wounded - can she make it?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nShe can make it.\n\n(a beat - she looks at him)\n\nWill?\n\nBefore he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -\n\nOLD MAN\n\nIt's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.\n\n(turns to Strider)\n\nYour people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.\nLong may their spirits haunt you\n\n(he turns back to Will)\n\nYou and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.\nOur hearth is not home to ny ape.\n\nWILL\n\nThen it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.\n\nThe Old Man's lip curls in a sneer. He shrugs and walks away.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nGo with them. Will - everyone needs their own kind.\n\nWill and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -\n\nWILL\n\nNo!\n\nDIAMOND\n\nOf course we can't...\n\n(to Will)\n\nThe city, Will.\n\nWill and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous.\n\nWILL\n\nWe call it a city - it's more like a fortress, Billie. It can't be done.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThe three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too.\n\nWILL\n\nWe were lucky. But that's the trouble with luck - it runs out. I don't want\nto be back in the city when it does.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat about Eve - what do we do, just forget about her?\n\nWILL\n\nNo. Maybe we can't stop the apes giving her the disease - but they'll have\nto turn her loose. That's the only way she can infect others. So we lay a\nplan and we find her. Then it's our job to stop her having children. If we\ncan do that, it can't be passed on through the race.\n\nShe shrugs That's the only thing I can think of.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHow long will that take - less than twenty-five days ?\n\nWILL\n\nNo.\n\nDIAMOND So what of my child?\n\nWe have to face it - you're going to lose it.\n\nShe turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her\nside -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nWe can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other\nchildren. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhose, Will - whose children?\n\nShe looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.\n\nWILL\n\nguess that's your call.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that\nmatters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take\nyou so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us\ngreat. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?\nWhat would you do if it was your child?\n\nShe looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -\n\nWILL\n\nI don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to\ngetting into the city. I just don't know...\n\nHe picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nIt sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we\ncould cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThere's one place that's not.\n\nBoth Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nDown here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.\nFrom there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to\ncross the river.\n\nHe draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is\nabout to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,\nhalf formed, is starting to form.\n\nWILL\n\nMaybe there is a way...across the river, I mean.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHow?\n\nWill turns to her -\n\nWILL\n\nYou'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWe're going? Is that right - we're going!?\n\nTheir eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.\n\nTHREE SILHOUETTES\n\ntravel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind\nthem. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and\nStrider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -\n\nLIGHTS TWINKLE\n\non the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades\nare on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts\ntowards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out\nof a stone chimney.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThey've started up the furnace.\n\n(softly)\n\nLet the games begin.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat games?\n\nWILL\n\nThe apes kill their prisoners for sport. The furnace takes care of the\nbodies.\n\nDiamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will. Already he's heading off,\nleading them down nrrow trail.\n\nA HIDDEN LEDGE\n\nmuch closer to the city. Will and the others move fast along it, deep in\nthe shadows. The river thunders by below them, separating them from the\ncity. The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards\npatrol it.\n\nOnly Diamond pauses to look et it. Will and Strider urge her forward. It\ndisappears from view.\n\nA STEEL ARROW\n\nflies through the air. Tied to its shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope\nmade from vines. Will lowers a crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through\nthe mist and spray -\n\nTHE RIVER\n\nraces by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow\nburies itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank.\n\nON THE OTHER SHORE\n\nWill and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches\nfrom one side of the river to the other. All it has to do is hold. Will\nturns to Diamond. He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -\n\nWILL\n\nYou first. We'll be right behind.\n\nDiamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope. She\nlooks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray;\nthe roaring water rushes by; the rope hangs like a thread. There's fear on\nher face -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nYou ready?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIt sure as shit ain't Kansas, is it?\n\nWILL\n\nGo!\n\nDiamond throws herself forward. Her feet leave the platform. Hand over hand\nshe goes - out across the river.\n\nWill watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the\nrope.\n\nStrider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps. The line bows\nunder his weight. Diamond'l feet drop closer to the water. She looks down -\nthe mass of black water, flecked with foam, rushes past.\n\nWill looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray. She's\ndripping wet, hauling herself forward -\n\nThe sound of the Falls is deafening. Right below her, a huge, swirling\n\"hole\" opens up. It's a whirlpool. She starts to swing across it. Joltl\n\nTHE TREE TRUNK\n\nThe arrow pulls part way out of the tree. The steel shaft shivers but it\nholds. Everything seems okay. Suddenly -\n\nSnap! One of the strands of the vine breaks -\n\nON THE ROPE\n\nEverything bucks and shudders. Diamond screams. She looks down - straight\ninto the vortex of the whirlpool. Her blood runs cold - she freezes.\n\nWILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE. HE SCREAMS AT HER -\n\nWILL\n\nGo! Billie - go!\n\nShe doesn't seem to hear. Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down, down\ninto the whirlpool's bottomless well.\n\nWILL, TRYING TO GET TO HER, HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD. THE ROPE STRAINS AND\nBOWS -\n\nWILL\n\nMove!\n\nShe doesn't react. Strider watches as Will tries to catch up. The rope is\nswaying so much it's agonizingly slow.\n\nDiamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness. The whirlpool\nseems to be swallowing everything, even the moonlight -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nBilliai What about the baby?!\n\nThe word hits her. She pulls her eyes from the swirling death. She looks at\nWill.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nMove, Billiel Nowl\n\nShe understands. She starts to pull herself forward. Will slumps with\nrelief -\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nThe arrow moves another inch out of the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft\nis strained to breaking point. But still everything holds...\n\nTHE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE\n\nOne of the guards patrols the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash\nof something. He looks towards the Falls.\n\nGUARD\n\n(calling)\n\nGimla.\n\nThe other guard joins him. They peer through the night at the spray rising\nfrom the Falls. They see it again - above the river, a flash of light on\nmetal.\n\nThe keep watching. An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second. They see\nStrider going hand over hand along the rope, moonlight glinting on his\ncrossbow.\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nAnother strand of the rope breaks. We follow it as it unravels - past\nDiamond and Will. Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope\nis so badly frayed it can't go any farther. It's going to break any moment.\n\nScreech! A siren wails.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nThey've seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge. Through a hole in the\nmist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling. A whole squadron runs to join\nthem.\n\nDiamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel\n\nWill and Strider give it everything they've got. Strider's first hand\npasses the frayed section. He's following it with his second -\n\nSnap! The whole rope breaks. Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the\nripping current. But at leaIt he's clinging to the rope with both hands.\nStrider's in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of\none paw. Will turns and reaches for him.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nNo! Save yourselfl\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nDiamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in. The\nweight - of the men and the current - make it impossible. All she can do is\ntry and hold them.\n\nON THE ROPE\n\nStrider's fingers are slipping free. Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to\npaw. Will holds him.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nWe'll both die. Let gol Will shakes his head - no. Hanging on to the rope\none-handed, the current tearing at his body, he tries to haul Strider in.\n\nWhizz! An arrow flies past, just missing them, and plunges into the water.\nThe apes on the bridge are firing.\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nAnother minute, we'll both be dead. Do it, Willl\n\nWill tries again to drag Strider to the rope. Another arrow flies through\nthe mist and spray - even closer. Strider reaches out with his free hand.\nHe starts to prize Will's fingers loose -\n\nSTRIDER (CONT'D)\n\nIf nothing else, I made it to the Falls No Return.\n\nWill realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider.\n\nWILL\n\nThe sacred words, Strider - what are the words?!\n\nSTRIDER\n\n\"In the beginning...\n\nWILL\n\n'In the beginning was the word and the word wes God...'\n\nSTRIDER\n\n(in wonder)\n\nYou know the words?\n\nWILL\n\nYou'll walk in the next world, Strider.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nHow do you know?\n\nWILL\n\nI've seen the future, haven't I?\n\nStrider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace.\n\nSTRIDER\n\nGood-bye Will. Take care of Billie.\n\nHe twists Will's last finger free. He drops - the swirling river carries\nhim away. Will is close to tears, but he won't let himself cry. Two more\narrows sizzle past -\n\nWILL\n\nAnd the word was God. Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I\nwill fear no evil...\n\nStrider spins down the river, through the spray and foam.\n\nWILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I\nwill dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.\n\nStrider, one arm raised, plunges over the Falls.\n\nON THE BRIDGE\n\nWe see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling\non the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and\nclouds of mist.\n\nDrak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring\nof his crossbow and reloads.\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nDiamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in\nwater, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to\nscramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -\n\nJust for a moment, the mist clears.\n\nON THE BRIDGE\n\nmoment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his\naim and fires -\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nDiamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,\nthrough his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her\narms.\n\nThe mist closes around them.\n\nHUGE STONE ARCH\n\nThe survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of\nthem are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are\nleaving the valley.\n\nKip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out\ninto a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -\n\nKip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises\nfrom the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards\nthem. It's Aragorn!\n\nKip's wife moves forward and embraces him -\n\nKIP'S WIFE\n\nWe thought you were dead.\n\nARAGORN\n\nHunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -\n\nHe indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The\nYoung Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nFor three days a squadron of apes have tracked us. Last night we ambushed\nthem. We're heading now for the eagle's nest.\n\nKIP'S WIFE\n\n(softly)\n\nThere is no eagle's nest.\n\nAragorn stares at her, not wanting to believe it.\n\nKIP'S WIFE (CONT'D)\n\nWe're all that's left of the Seven Tribes.\n\nGrief wells up inside Aragorn. We hold on his face.\n\nA FIRE CRACKLES\n\nAll of the tribes-people are gathered around it.\n\nOLD MAN\n\nThere is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.\n\nARAGORN\n\n(shaking his head)\n\nNo. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For\nme * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go\nalone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find\nthere.\n\nOLD MAN\n\nThen it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been\nthe way of it in Middle Earth.\n\nARAGORN\n\nBut nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of\nthem?\n\nKIP'S WIFE\n\nYou're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must\nallow the women to follow, too.\n\nARAGORN But women can't fight.\n\nKIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they\ncan't.\n\nAll the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for\nAragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.\n\nThe tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of\nthe folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe\nstare at it.\n\nLOOKOUT\n\nI found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had\nleft Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.\n\nHe hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again\nties the talisman of his rank around his neck.\n\nARAGORN\n\nDouse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going to war.\n\nON THE SHORE\n\nThe apes, carrying torches, search the river bank and surrounding cliffs.\nWe push in on a pool of darkness behind them -\n\nWill and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree.\nThey have done their best to dress Will's wound but he's obviously in a lot\nof pain -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nYou can't go on, Will - not like this.\n\nWILL\n\nWhat about the baby?\n\nDIAMOND\n\nI'll keep going - I'll try and get Eve.\n\nWILL\n\nAlone? Don't be ridiculous -\n\nHe starts to haul himself to his feet. His face twists in pain - he has to\nstop.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nLook at you - you can barely walk.\n\nHe puts out his hand, needing I boost up.\n\nWILL\n\nIf I can just get up - help me.\n\nDiamond shakes her head - no. They look at one another.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nDon't do this to me - pleasel\n\nDIAMOND\n\nYou've done enough - more than anyone else could. You're one of the finest\nmen\n\nI've ever known - but it's over, Will. You're going to have to wait. Now\nit's my turn -\n\nShe grabs her weapons and starts to leave. Will makes it to his feet -\n\nWILL\n\nBillie!She's almost through the tangled roots.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nI made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved. At the\nend, I let her go into danger alone.\n\nDiamond stops.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhere was that - Berkeley, Will?\n\nShe turns and looks at him. He nods his head - yes.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWILL\n\nI knew I'd found the chemical key. I was working with three young\nresearchers. One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily. We were engaged.\nThey were the ones that went into the tanks. I didn't know as much as I\nthought I did. They died in there.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhy didn't you go, Will?\n\nWILL\n\nWe all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa drew lots for it. I should\nnever have agreed, but we were young - and like the young we thought life\nwould last forever.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nRobert Plant died too, didn't he - in a way?\n\nWILL\n\nThe experiment was unauthorized. There was an inquiry. They said the theory\nhad no basis. 'Ludicrous\" was a word they used. My career had gone up like\na rocket. It came down like the stick. I couldn't find work anywhere\n\nDIAMOND\n\n\"Will Robinson\" - that was your joke, I guess. You were Lost in Space, were\nyou?\n\nWILL\n\nYeah, but I never realized it'd be so appropriate.\n\nThey sort of smile at one another.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nhad twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what,\nthough. It was just a mind game. But I've learnt a lot of things - the most\nimportant is that sometimes you get a second chance. A second chance for a\nlot of things -\n\nHe looks straight at her. They hold each other's eyes.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nAnd when you do, you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go.\nI've got the heart, Billie. It's my body that's failing me.\n\nNeither one of them moves. A beat.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nGive me your hand, Will.\n\nShe helps him to his feet.\n\nA GIANT CHASM\n\nIt's several hours before dawn. In the gloom - whooshl Kip's Wife rides a\nflying fox across a precipitous drop.\n\nShe lands on the other side of a jagged ravine. The rest of the tribe, all\nheavily armed, are waiting there. They turn end run, fading into the trees.\n\nTHE FUNERAL ROCK\n\njuts out into the roaring river. Will and Diamond scramble out of the\ndarkness and land on the rock. Will's face is haggard with pain but he\nforces himself forward. He's loosening up. going faster as he moves -\n\nThey pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple.\n\nA DARKENED ROOM\n\nTorches flicker on the walls. From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear\nthe sound of a crowd. A young ape, barely in his teens, stands in the\nmiddle of the room, almost naked. His face is painted with strange ochre\nmarkings.\n\nA circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade. Intoning\nwords in some strange tongue, he slices the blade across the Teenager's\nforehead. The Teenager winces but he doesn't cry out - this is his manhood\nceremony.\n\nTHE STABLES\n\nThe sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we don't see them. The\nprisoners from the Eagle's Nest are crowded into the corrals.\n\nOne of the gates is thrown open. Three ape guards enter. They push the\ntribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy. His mother clings to him,\nscreaming. One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the\ncorral.\n\nAN ARENA\n\n-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables. Now we see the crowd\n- apes, all males, sit in the bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and\nthe young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring.\n\nHe looks around the arena - yelling, screaming apes. Terror on his face. An\neven louder roar goes up. The Boy turns -\n\nThe Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel, the ochre markings on his face like\nwar-paint, the blood barely dried on his forehead. He carries spears and a\nclub.\n\nOne of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy.\nThe Teenage ape moves in on him. He is a warrior now - this is going to be\nhis first kill.\n\nIN THE CORRAL\n\nThe Boy's mother is huddled down, being comforted by other tribes-people. A\nhuge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck. The sound\ncarries over to -\n\nA TERRACE\n\nDrak is alone, walking a high ridge. He stops, looking down on the\ntwinkling lights. The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesn't move -\nhe's uneasy, troubled by something he can't put a name to.\n\nTHE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM\n\nThe five baby apes sit on cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe\ninto the smallest ape's arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts\nher as she draws out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri\n\nDOCTOR ZORA\n\nIs the girl animal ready?\n\nBEN-GURI\n\nThey're doing it now.\n\nINSIDE THE LABORATORY\n\nEve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an\noperating table. He and another guard start to strap her down.\n\nThe Vet works at the bench, heating a steel needle over a flame. It's the\nsame sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle\nattached to a long tube. A knock on the door.\n\nVET\n\nThat must be Zors with the blood.\n\nOne of the guards goes and unbolts the door. He recoils - it's Will.\nSswhack! He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow. It takes\nthe guard in the chest.\n\nHe and Diamond dive into the room. Eve starts hollering. The second guard\nis wheeling, crossbow rising. He rifle-butts Diamond across the head. Her\nweapon goes flying.\n\nThe guard is aiming. Will is on the floor, tumbling. Barely time to aim, on\nhis back, firing overhead, he shoots -\n\nWhack! Bullseye. The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed.\n\nThe Vet grabs the first guard's fallen crossbow. He aims at Will. Diamond\nscreams a warning but there's nothing Will can do - he's struggling to\nreload, one-handed because of his wounds.\n\nDiamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench. The Vet\nreaches for the trigger. Diamond leaps forward. She drives the syringe into\nhis chest.\n\nThe Vet stands goggle-eyed. Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent\nof blood pours down the clear tube. It spills on to the floor. The Vet\ntopples forward.\n\nSlash! Slash! Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table.\n\nOUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING\n\nDrak turns a corner of the building. He stops and touches the ground with\nhis finger. He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet,\nfollowing trail of blood.\n\nA TORCH\n\nis ripped from a bracket. It's Drak.. He shines it down into a stone well.\nThe flame splits the darkness. Floating in the water at the bottom of the\nwell is an ape guard -dead, an arrow through his throat.\n\nIN THE ARENA\n\nThe Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust, bleeding badly from a rip across his\nribs. His spear lies next to him, a wooden shield raised across his head.\nThe Teenage ape , rains blows down on it with a sword.\n\nThe apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly. Smash! The shield splinters.\nThe sword slices the Boy's arm -\n\nAPES\n\nKill! Kill! Kill!\n\nThe Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword.\n\nShriek! The alarm sounds. Everything freezes. Then officers are on their\nfeet, yelling orders. Ape soldiers grab their weapons, heading for the\ndoors.\n\nThe Teenage ape looks around, robbed of his moment. The Boy sees his\nchance. He raises his spear and drives it deep into the ape's groin. He\nstaggers and falls - on top of the Boy.\n\nThe apes pour out of the arena. The siren carries over to -\n\nA STONE CORRIDOR\n\nWill's got Eve slung over his shoulder. They're stumbling down a corridor -\npast other labs and research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into\n-\n\nA COURTYARD\n\nat the back of the Hall of Learning. It's deep in shadow. From behind they\nhear the sound of pounding feet. Will looks around, not sure which way to\ngo. He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open. The\nape warriors charge out.\n\nWILL\n\nCan you ride?\n\nDiamond nods her head - yes. He thrusts Eve into her hands -\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nGo for the stables. Head for the eagle's nest. I'll try to join you there.\n\nDiamond hesitates - she doesn't want to leave him.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nWhat are you going to do?\n\nWILL\n\nDelay them. Now go, Billie. Go!\n\nTHE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR\n\nrops down the side of the ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about\n\nTHE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR\n\na dozen Praetorian Guards. Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums\nare lighting up the streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running\neverywhere - searching.\n\nON THE GROUND\n\nThe flame-thrower rolls along a street. The driver's canopy is hidden by\nflapping tarpaulins. In the chaos nobody pays it any attention.\n\nON THE ELEVATOR\n\nNazgul sees the machine rolling towards them.\n\nNAZGUL\n\nThat's strange - why does Drak need the Flame?\n\nSuddenly he realizel. He turns, screaming up at the apes controlling the\nmechanism.\n\nNAZGUL (CONT'D)\n\nStopl Take it backl\n\nTHE FLAME-THROWER\n\ndead guard is draped over the side of the machine, blood dripping from his\nheadWill is in the cabin, working the controls. He sees the elevator slow\nin mid-descent. He throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -\n\nWhoosh! A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel.\n\nTwo of the guards are trying to climb the ropes. Nazgul is wheeling around\nin a panic. The flame hits them! The whole wooden structure catches fire.\nWe see the apes through the flames, struggling and writhing.\n\nThe ropes burn through. The blazing structure plummets down -\n\nTHE CENTRAL SQUARE\n\nSmash! It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape\nsoldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills\nthe air.\n\nEVE SITS ALONE\n\nShe's on the floor of the stables, deep in shadow. She's scared, looking\nahead -\n\nThe first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors. We see an ape\nguard, keys jangling from his waist, on petrol.\n\nHe hears something - a rock falling, a rustle of movement. Raising his\nweapon, he moves towards a pool of black shadow, past a pile of rocks, into\nan alcove.\n\nDiamond rises out of the rocks behind him. He spins - she's got her\ncross-bow raised. Point-blank range. She nails him.\n\nTHE PRISONERS\n\nare shackled in the corrals. They see Diamond running out of the shadows\ntowards them. She tossel them the keys -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nArm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes. The prisoners\nstart to unlock the chains.\n\nEVE\n\nsmiles as Diamond races out of the shadows, sweeps her up and keeps\nrunning.\n\nIN THE ARENA\n\nThe Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell, their spilt blood staining\nthe dust.\n\nThe Boy's mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son.\nShe drags off the ape. Her son's eyes are closed, his arms lacerated, his\nchest wounded and crusted with blood. She stares at him - he doesn't move.\n\nShe starts to sob. The Boy's eyes flicker open. They look at one another.\nThe motheY gathers him into her arms. He's alive! He's alive!\n\nThe sound of a horse. The mother turns, fearful. She looks across the\narena, through a railing -\n\nIN THE CORRALS\n\nDiamond gallops a stallion through the corrals. Eve's clutching the saddle\nin front of her - hair flying, her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The\nstallion gallops faster.\n\nThe prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look. It's\na magnificent sight. Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse.\nStraight ahead - a railed fence, part of the corral.\n\nShe leaps the horse over it. They land. In front - another hurdle. Again\nshe does it.\n\nThe prisoners stare. Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables.\n\nCLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME\n\nThe crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is\nburning.\n\nThe Flame stands on a steep incline, its back wedged against the wall of a\nterrace. Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape\nsoldiers at bay.\n\nThe soldiers turn - Drak, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard, gallops\nstraight towards them. He'l not stopping for anything - the soldiers\nscramble aside.\n\nIN THE CABIN\n\nWill sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke.\nThey look like the horsemen of the apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we\nsea a primitive gauge above his head. It's in the red -\n\nIN THE SQUARE\n\nWhoosh! The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke. It touches the guards\nwith a deadly kiss, throwing them screaming from their horses. But Drak\nblasts through -\n\nIN THE CABIN\n\nWill is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke. He peers through it -\nDrak charges towards him! Will hits the lever again. The flame erupts from\nthe barrel. Then it dies - out of fuel.\n\nWILL\n\nShit!\n\nIN THE SQUARE\n\nDrak gallops forward. He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He\naims -\n\nIN THE CABIN\n\nWill throws himself aside. He smashes both hands down on a lever on the\nfloor. A hiss of steam. The machine lurches forward -\n\nIN THE SQUARE\n\nDrak tries to get a clear shot at Will. The machine gathers speed down the\nincline, coming straight towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels\naround. He charges alongside the cabin - it's empty\n\nON THE MACHINE\n\nWill clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled\nsquare. He's out of sight of Drak - but not for long. The ape and his\nstallion loom into view behind the machine, Will scrambles back into the\ncabin -\n\nIN THE SQUARE\n\nApes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square. Drak is\nat full gallop, veering from one side of the Flame to the other. Will\nclambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt.\n\nDrak swings his horse close to the back of the machine. He stands up in the\nstirrups, the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - he's going on board!\n\nThe Flame flies out of the square and down a street. An ape throws himself\ninto a doorway - just in time, Drak steadies himself, about to jump.\nSuddenly his horse whinnies wildly. Drak looks ahead - holy shit!. They're\nheading straight for the front of a blazing house.\n\nDrak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins. Will hurls\nhimself back into the cabin, arms shielding his head. Smash! The Flame\ncrashes through the front wall -\n\nINSIDE THE HOUSE\n\nThe barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the\nwalls in a shower of burning timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and\nstops in a courtyard.\n\nWill clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground. A yell goes up -\napes are coming through the adjoining houses. Will turns and heads down an\nalleyway.\n\nCITY STREET\n\nDiamond's horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side, a\nrow of burning buildings on the other. The road turns right. She swings\naround it - apes! A platoon of them right in front of her. She screams at\nEve -\n\nDIAMOND\n\nHold on!\n\nShe throws herself aside, pulling on the reins. The horse spins in a\nU-turn, grazing past a burning building. Diamond gallops back the way she\ncame.\n\nCrash! The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses. Blazing\nbeams block the road. The horse shies away. Diamond wheels him around -\n\nThe apes race into the road. She looks around desperately - she's trapped.\nShe grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - she'll be safer\nthere.\n\nShe spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - she's going to\ncharge straight through the apes. They drop to one knee - the firing\nposition - and raise their weapons. A dozen crossbowl aim straight at\nDiamond.\n\nThere's no way out - she flies towards them. Whizzl The sound of arrows.\nBut it's not the apes - they go down like nine-pins.\n\nDiamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived! Backlit by the rising sun, the men\nand women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes.\nNobody fires better than Kip's Wife.\n\nDiamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the\nroad.\n\nMA-GOG\n\nstands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in the wind, his one cruel eye\nblazing with anger. Flanked by two ape warriors, he looks down on the\nburning buildings.\n\nThe freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables.\n\nMa-Gog sees Will - he's running along the rooftops, leaping from one\nbuilding to the next. Ma-Gog points at him, yelling at apes in the streets\nbelow -\n\nMA-GOG (CONT'D)\n\nKill him! In the name of God, kill himl Sswhish! The blade of a sword\ncleaves through frame. It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist.\nMa-Gog spins - it's Aragorn, armed to the teeth, behind them.\n\nThe second warrior goes for him. Aragorn has dropped the sword. He raises a\ncrossbow and fires. The bolt shatters the ape's armor and buries itself in\nhis chest.\n\nMa-Gog swirls aside his cloak. In his good hand he holds a double-edged\nsword. Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gog's arcing blow.\nHe lunges with a short-handled spear -\n\nARAGORN\n\nFor my people!\n\nIt takes Ma-Gog in the gut. His one eye bulges. Aragorn rips the spear out\n-\n\nARAGORN (CONT'D)\n\nAnd this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priest's\nheart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.\n\nON THE ROOFTOP\n\nWill has seen it all. He screams -\n\nWILL\n\nBehind you! Aragorn - behind!\n\nON THE TERRACE\n\nAragorn turns. It's Drak, on horseback, thundering down on him. But the\nleader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost\nchild.\n\nHe raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak. The huge ape\nlevels the shoulder-mounted harpoon. He pulls the trigger. Sswang! The\npowerful spring on the barrel releases, the harpoon trails a length of rope\nbehind it -\n\nWham! The harpoon smashes through Aragorn's chest. He dies as he falls.\n\nON THE ROOFTOP\n\nWill stares in anguish. He turns away - he sees Diamond. She's at full\ngallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces\nbelow. She's got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom.\n\nWill looks across at Drak - he's seen her too! For a moment the two of them\nstare at one another. Will's face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he\ncarries.\n\nDrak's lip curls in a sneer - he knows he's going to win. He beats his\nchest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace,\ngoing for Diamond.\n\nWill runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop.\n\nINSIDE A HOUSE\n\nAn ape mother cowers in a corner, her two children clutched to her, the\nsounds of battle all around. She looks up in terror -\n\nSmash! Will's feet blast through the roof. He lands on the floor, crossbow\nraised -but not st her. Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on\nhorseback. Wham! Will shoots him and runs for the horse.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nand Eve fly down charred street .They head towards a large open square.\n\nOUTSIDE THE STABLES\n\nSmoke and dust swirl through the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape\ninfantry. Drak races past the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied\naround the saddle, dragging Aragorn's body through the dust.\n\nHe looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square. Drak whips his horse\nforward -\n\nA CURVED ROAD\n\non a high terrace. Flying around a corner - Will! His coat is billowing,\nthe horse's mane streaming in the wind. He hits the straight-away and\ngallops even faster.\n\nHe looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on\nher. Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock.\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nEve clings tight to Diamond's waist. The little girl looks back - Drak is\nthundering behind them, pennants snapping in the wind, armor glinting on\nthe horse's chest. It's an awesome sight.\n\nDrak has the reins in his teeth. He's using both hands to reload the\nharpoon.\n\nDiamond sees the bridge dead ahead. Heavily armed apes have barricaded it.\nShe curses and yanks the bridle. The horse sweeps around an island in the\ncenter of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape. She gallops back the\nway she came, almost passing Drak. He charges round the island.\n\nOUT OF THE TUNNEL\n\ncomes Will. He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming\nback towards him! He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel.\n\nWhooshl He flies out the other end, into daylight. He looks over his\nshoulder - he's in front of them but thirty feet too high. He digs his\nheels into the horse's flanks -over a Iow wall they fly. God knows where it\ngoes -\n\nDOWN A ROCKY SUDE\n\ninto a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are\nguarding the Claw and the Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops\nthe first ape.\n\nThe second ape aims at him. Will raises another crossbow. They fire almost\nsimultaneously. Will throws himself aside, out of the saddle. The horse\nrears and bolts.\n\nWill looks up from the dirt - the ape has Will's arrow embedded in his\nchest. He falls forward - dead.\n\nWill scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below. Diamond\nand Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him. Will\ngrabs a crossbow and struggles to reload. He can't - it takes the strength\nof both arms to cock it,\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nDiamond's horse is lathered in sweat, almost blown. Eve looks over her\nshoulder, her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind, gaining at every\nstep.\n\nIN THE CUL-DE-SAC\n\nWill leaps from the Balls on to the Claw.\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nDrak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve\nsees the weapon lock on to their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -\n\nEVE\n\nBillie!\n\nDiamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road. Drak\nloses her in his sights. He follows her over the wagon.\n\nON THE CLAW\n\nWill is in the driver's seat. He throws a lever - nothing happens. He tries\nanother -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the\nroad.\n\nDRAK\n\naims the harpoon. He's got Eve end Diamond, one behind the other, in his\nsights.\n\nDRAK\n\nA bargain - two for the price of onel\n\nON THE CLAW\n\nWill spins a small steering wheel.\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nDrak is close behind Diamond. The harpoon's massive spring is coiled.\nDrak's finger curls around the trigger, about to fire.\n\nSuddenly he screams - dropping right in front, coming straight towards him,\nare the opening jaws of the Claw.\n\nWILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -\n\nWILL\n\nKeep your hands off her, you dirty ape.\n\nThe jaws lock clean around Drak's waist, plucking him off the saddle and\nlifting him up into the air. He's still got the harpoon. He sees Will at\nthe control. He swings the barrel round -\n\nWill hits a switch. Wrong one - nothing happens.\n\nDrak's got him in his sights. His finger finds the trigger -\n\nWill throws another switch.\n\nThe jaws start to close! Drak tries to pull the trigger - he can't, his\nbody is twisting. The jaws are crushing him! He musters all of his strength\nand tries to fire. He and Will look straight at one another. A beat. Drsk's\nfinger starts to slide off the trigger -\n\nIN THE SQUARE\n\nApes stare up at their warrior lord, clamped in the Clew. He let out a\nblood curdling scream. The bottom half of his torso - everything from the\nwaist down - falls towards the ground. Maybe it's just the wind, but the\nlegs still seem to be kicking.\n\nThe apes reel beck in horror. With mighty battle cry, the tribes-people -\nthe prisoners end Aregom'l followers - hurl themselves forward, attacking.\n\nThe apes break end start to run.\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nDiamond end Eve have dismounted. Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming\ntowards her. She holds out her arms and they embrace. Neither one says a\nword, they just hold each other tight.\n\nCLOUDS OF SMOKE\n\nalmost obscure the setting sun. Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge\nwatching the tribes-people. They've harnessed horses to ropes tied around\nthe statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths\ncome crashing down.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nIf nothing else, we helped the tribes take back their valley.\n\nWILL\n\nOur valley, too Billia.\n\nShe looks at him - questioning.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\n\nThere's one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back.\n\nShe smiles at him.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nA small point. But give me some credit. I'm a scientist - I knew that.\n\nWILL\n\n(in wonder)\n\nBut you came anyway.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nThat was love.\n\nWILL\n\nFor the baby?\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nDIAMOND\n\nFor the both of you.\n\nThey stare into each other's eyes. They kiss.\n\nDIAMOND (CONT'D)\nI only have one regret. We'll never know if we succeeded.\n\nWILL\nOf course we will. You're pregnant - if the baby's born alive, we'll know\nit worked.\n\nSUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN\n\nThe surf rolls in on a golden beach. At the water's edge, a line of\nfootprints. We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He's\nbuilding something out of iron and rock and sand but we can't make out what\nit is.\n\nDIAMOND (O.S.)\nWill \n\nHe turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave.\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE\n\nDiamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins. Her belly is exposed,\nheaw with the unborn child. Eve crouches next to her, trying to help.\n\nWILL\nIt's started?\n\nShe nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts.\n\nTHE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA\n\nFrom inside the cave, we hear Diamond scream.\n\nIN THE CAVE\n\nWill kneels between Diamond's legs. Her face, glistening with sweat; is a\nmask of pain. She holdl Eve's hind tight and pushes.\n\nWill, half hidden by her upraised legs, delivers the child. Diamond raises\nherself up -trying to See her child. Neither she nor us can see it's face.\n\nWe push in on Will. Ha raises his hand and slaps the baby's rump. No sound.\nHa raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry. Now we see the\nbaby - a perfect little boy.\n\nEve laughs. Diamond smiles. Tears fill her eyes. She and Will look at one\nanother. He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms.\n\nTHE CAVE\n\nWill and Eve help Diamond. She comes out of the cave, still holding the\nbaby. It's magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge, looking at the ocean\nwashed with color from the setting sun.\n\nWe see what Will was building. It's sort of like a sculpture - just the\nhead and crown of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nDiamond smiles.
