RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT\n</b>\nFrom the outside parking lot it looks like an\nenormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for\nall the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the\nparking lot or stand by the mall entrance.\n\n<b>INT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL\n</b>\nThere are three levels of stores underneath a\nmassive fluorescent roof. Different music comes\nfrom each store. It looks seventies-modern, but\nalready used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise\nthe mall, eyeing each other and acting cool.\n\n<b>INT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie\nuniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with\ntheir orders.\n\nA good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and\nsits. He wears a plastic name tag that says:\n\"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON.\"\n\nTwo Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme\nindifference, and take their orders into the back\nkitchen.\n\n<b>INT.

She puts down a\nglass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 \n</b>\tHe's too old for Stacy, she hasn't\n\teven started high school yet.\n\nA flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tHow's it going.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tDo you think that guy's cute?\n\n<b>\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 \n</b>\tIn a blow-dryed kind of way.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tDoes anyone else want to take his\n\ttable?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tDon't you like him?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tYeah, but I fucked up.

SWENSON'S DINING ROOM\n</b>\nStacy goes to Ron's table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRON \n</b>\tSo you working hard or hardly\n\tworking?\n\nStacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and\nlaughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her\nsoulfully.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRON (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYou look like you could still be in\n\thigh school.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tI know, everyone says that.\n\nHe stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWhat can I get for you tonight.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRON \n</b>\tHow about your phone number?\n\nStacy smiles nervously.\n\n<b>INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHT\n</b>\nA teenage boy stands in front of an in-mall theatre\nacross from Swenson's. He wears a stiff over-sized\ntuxedo suit. He is Mark \"The Rat\" Ratner, a ticket\ntaker on the job.\n\nMike Damone, a transplanted Easterner, bops over\nfrom the record store, eyeing every girl he passes.\nHe stops at the movie theatre.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTHE RAT \n</b>\tDo you ever look at those girls who\n\twork at Swenson's?

CARL'S JR. - NIGHT\n</b>\nAt the other end of the mall is a neon-lit Carl's\nJr. Hamburger Restaurant. If Swenson's was the warm\nup, this is the main attraction of the Ridgemont\nMall.\n\n<b>INT. CARL'S JR.\n</b>\nBack-to-school banners hang from the walls. Many\nkids are lined up at the counters. In the middle of\nthe kitchen, directing all the orders, is a\nseventeen year old named Brad. He moves\nconfidently, observing the fryer, checking cup\nsupply, and giving an affectionate squeeze to a\npretty cashier named Lisa. She lets him kiss her,\nbut only once.\n\nA teenage Customer shouts to Brad from the front\ncounter.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCUSTOMER \n</b>\tHey Brad! I waited till you came\n\ton! I wanted your fries.\n\nBrad smiles, walks over to the fryer and discards\nthe fries left from the previous shift.

You had shirts on\n\twhen you came in here.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON THE MAIN SURFER\n</b>\na bleary kid sitting at the head of the table.

I took care of it,\n\tDennis.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON SURFERS\n</b>\ngrumbling, putting shirts back on.

MALL - LATE NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy\nand Linda walk through the large empty mall.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tHe gave me his card. \n\t\t(lovingly)\n\t'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\t\t(amused)\n\tShould we buy a frame for that?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tCome on, Linda, I haven't had a\n\tboyfriend all summer. You promised\n\twhen I started working at the mall\n\tthat my life would change... Do you\n\tthink he'll call this week?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tListen, Stace, you want to know\n\tabout guys? I'll tell you. They're\n\tmostly chicken. Before I met Doug I\n\tchased after every guy I thought\n\twas cute. I thought if I gave out a\n\tvibe they'd get the message and\n\tcall me up. Well, guess what? They\n\tdon't call.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tSo what did you do?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tI called them. If I was sitting\n\tnext to a guy and I wanted to sit\n\tcloser, I'd sit closer. If I wanted\n\tto kiss him, I'd just do it. You\n\twant Ron Johnson? Grab him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tI can't do that.\n\nThey pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says:\nLINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tFace it. With some guys you have to\n\tmake the first move. A lot of guys\n\tare just... wussies.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tReally?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tStacy, what are you waiting for?\n\tYou're fifteen. I did it when I was\n\tthirteen. It's no huge thing. It's\n\tjust sex. If you don't, one of the\n\tother girls will.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\t\t(cute)\n\tHe was hot, wasn't he?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tIf I didn't have a fiance in\n\tChicago, I'd go for it.\n\nA young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and\nStacy.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\t(breathless)\n\tAre you Linda Barrett?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\tI'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us.\n\tJudy Hinton from May Company told\n\tme I could ask you something.\n\nLinda nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI have this situation with my\n\tboyfriend, and I wanted to... \n\t\t(looks at Stacy, then\n\t\twhispers in Linda's ear)\n\nLinda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her\n\"sex expert\" mode.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tOkay, are you over sixteen?\n\nThe Girl nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n</b>\tAll right, what you want to do is\n\tgo to the Free Clinic and tell the\n\tdoctor that you have sex regularly \n\t- several times a week -- and that\n\tyou need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\tAnd they don't call my parents?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tNot if you're over sixteen.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\tOkay. Thanks a lot, Linda.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA\n</b>\tAnd don't let them talk you into a\n\tdiaphragm either.\n\nThe Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to\nthe back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to\nopen the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY\n</b>\tI can't believe I start high school\n\ttomorrow.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA\n</b>\tBelieve it.\n\nThey exit the mall, into the night.\n\n<b>EXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n</b>\nWe see all the elements of the first day of school.\nThe students carry new books, explore new lockers,\nbegin to stake out their ground.\n\nSomeone has taken the steel letters from the green\nvanguard out front. It reads: \"IDG MON SENOR HI\n<b>HO.\"\n</b>\nThe rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet\npaper. And a black spray paint message along the\nside of the front office building reads, \"LINCOLN\n<b>SURF NAZIS.\"\n</b>\n<b>EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY\n</b>\nBrad pulls into the Ridgemont High parking lot. He\ndrives a beat-up, four-door model LTD sedan. Three\nfriends wait for him near his parking space.\nThey are dressed in the same golf caps with brand\nlogos on the front like CAT, NATIONAL and CHAINSAW.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUDDY #1\n</b>\tHamilton!\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUDDY #2\n</b>\tThe cruising vessel! Hey -- Yooooo!\n\nBrad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBRAD\n</b>\tSix more payments, gentlemen.\n\nBrad joins his friends, and they walk towards the\ngymnasium.\n\n<b>EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT\n</b>\nWe see a shiny, new, blue Mustang whip into the\nparking lot. Students scatter from the parking\nspace. Behind the wheel is football star Charles\nJefferson. A huge, black kid. The halls at\nRidgemont part for Charles Jefferson.\n\nRat and Damone are in the parking lot. Damone\nsurrounded by underclassmen (customers) selling\ntickets.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE \n</b>\tSee that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave\n\tCharles Jefferson that car when he\n\twas a sophomore.\n\nThe underclassmen are impressed. They watch as\nJefferson opens his car door and stands to his full\nheight, over six-foot tall. He opens his trunk and\npulls out no books, just a football duffel bag. He\nslowly walks by Damone, Rat and the underclassmen.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHow ya doing! That car looks great,\n\tCharles!\n\nJefferson gives Damone a death glare.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJEFFERSON \n</b>\tDon't... fuck... with... it.\n\nHe moves on. Damone resumes selling tickets.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE \n</b>\tShit, that's my man.\n\n<b>EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT\n</b>\nWe see a clutching, smooching couple walk by.\nCheerleader Cindy Carr and her boyfriend, Gregg\nAdams.\n\n<b>EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY\n</b>\nThe Four Stoners (from Carl's Jr.) tumble out of a\nvan in the parking lot. They head towards the\ngymnasium.\n\n<b>INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - DAY\n</b>\nStanding by the A-B-C-D-E registration counter in\nthe gymnasium, Brad waits to pick up his red ad\ncard. He stands surrounded by his buddies. They nod\nvigorously at everything Brad says. As he talks,\nfellow students all say hello or pat him as they\npass.\n\nOne troubled-looking boy, Arnold, walks up to Brad.\n\n<b>\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\tBrad, can I talk to you a minute?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBRAD\n</b>\tArnold. What's happening?\n\nArnold speaks confidentially to Brad.\n\n<b>\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\tBrad, I really fuckin' hate\n\tMcDonald's, man. Ever since they\n\tstarted in with the chicken,\n\teverything went downhill.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBRAD\n</b>\tYou want to work at Carl's?\n\n<b>\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\tOh, man, if you could swing\n\tsomething there, I'd do anything\n\tfor you.

U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY\n</b>\nStacy barely slips in the door before the final\nattendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as\nthe teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the\nclassroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the\naisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed\nstep to the door at the front of the class, kicks\nthe door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in\ntheir frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her\nfirst high school class.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. HAND \n</b>\tAloha. My name is Mr. Hand.\n\nMr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard\nbefore his class. Every letter is a small explosion\nof chalk.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(almost sweetly)\n\tI have but one question for you on\n\tour first morning 'together.' \n\t\t(pause)\n\tCan you attend my class? Pakalo?...\n\tUnderstand?... History has proven\n\tus one basic fact. Man does not do\n\tanything that is not for his own\n\tgood. It is for your own good that\n\tyou attend my class. And if you\n\tcan't make it... I can make you.\n\nAn impatient knock begins at the front door of the\nclassroom.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWe have a twenty-question quiz\n\tevery Friday.

No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History\nclass dares mention it, much less answer it.\n\nStacy grips her desk with the tension of her first\nday.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n</b>\tAlso.

Pakalo?\n\nHand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the\nsound at the door and opens the door an inch.\nJeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes\nglistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and\nstreaming down the back of his white peasant shirt.\nHe grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as\nattendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy\nturns to his friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTUDENT \n</b>\tThat guy has been stoned since the\n\tthird grade.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. HAND \n</b>\tYes?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI \n</b>\tYeah.

RIDGEMONT LUNCH COURT - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nIt's packed. The school's outdoor dining area is\nactually just a small courtyard lined with fast\nfood machines and dominated by a large oak tree in\nthe center.

They sadly shake their heads at the\nsight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.\n\nAs we draw closer, we see the center of commotion.\nIt is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles\nJefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it\nto the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the\nmessage: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.\n\n<b>EXT.

The\nLincoln player is hit and keels over.\n\nCharles Jefferson sets up for another play. The\nball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another\nLincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was\nwho wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to\nspare any of them. There is pure madness in his\neyes. It has taken him over.\n\nThe Ridgemont points rack up.

Damone has\nalready poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the\ndetergent has created a huge bubble bath effect.\nDamone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi.\n\nStacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits\nkicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda\nstands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat\ntreads water and stares at both girls. Inside the\nHamilton living room, the family stereo plays the\nmusic of Deep Purple's \"Woman From Tokyo\".\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE \n</b>\tHey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.\n\tI'm a champion diver myself.\n\nBrad arrives home by the side gate and slams it\nbehind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He\nwalks out onto the patio and stands with his hands\non his hips. For the first time, our former campus\nhero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from\nCaptain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and\nwhite striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit,\ncomplete with black plastic sword at the side, and\na ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat.

We can read the emotions on\nThe Rat's face. He is still taken with Stacy, but\nhis big moment for her appears to have passed.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI\n</b>\nas they talk.\n\nUnderneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks\nagainst his. Then he feels her continue. Damone\nfeels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh.

You want to do\n\tsomething about it?\n\nDamone begins the classic high school fighting\nritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step\nback. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards\nhimself. Then Damone says the universally\nrecognized high school fighting words.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWell come on.\n\nThe Rat shows no fear.

He is the only shopper.\n\n<b>INT. 7-11 STORE\n</b>\nBrad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red\nand white striped shirt and cap, making fresh\ncoffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter.

A man in a windbreaker comes\nhurtling out of the car, into the store. He spray\npaints the scanning camera above the door. He\nhustles up to the counter, produces a .45 Magnum\nand points it chest high at Brad. There is a glazed\nand nervous speedy edge to his voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\tROBBER\n</b>\tI want money.

JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his\ncastle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A\nhuge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the\nwindow. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white\nshort-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's\nfat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his\nbong, all the while talking on the phone.

He grins and notices\nsomeone across the crowded dance floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBRAD \n</b>\tHey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!\n\nThey laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his\nelement at last. He moves into the main dancing\narea, works his way across the room, past the\nbleachers, when he hears a voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI (O.S.) \n</b>\tHamilton!\n\nBrad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the\nbottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back\nwith true respect.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n</b>\tAwesome.\n\nHe throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They\nsign.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n</b>\tEasy, mon.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBRAD \n</b>\tLater.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS\n</b>\nwhere several couples are passionately making out.\nFour teachers clomp up into the stands from\ndifferent angles. They pin the couples in\nflashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an\nescaping prisoner.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS\n</b>\nonstage, singing the Rolling Stones' \"I'm Free\".\n\n<b>EXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come\nbacking down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist\nis in the air.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI\n</b>\tSummer, mon! We're there!\n\nHe turns to his stoner bud.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n</b>\tLet's roll, my man.\n\nSpicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHey, bud! Watch yourselff\n\nSpicoli turns around to see he's backed into a\nsquad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis. They are all\nstanding on the steps, waiting.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSURF NAZI\n</b>\tAre you Jeff Spicoli?\n\nSpicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On\nthe end, he sees L.C.\n\n<b>\t\t\tL.C.\n</b>\tThat's him! He did it!\n\n<b>\t\t\tSPICOLI\n</b>\tHey, mon, I don't know what your\n\ttrip is, but...\n\nSpicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the\nSurf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him\nthrough the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and\ninto the night. They will never catch him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t  SLOW\n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE:\n</b>\n<b>INT. RIDGEMONT MALL\n</b>\nSchool is out and it's summer business as usual at\nthe Ridgemont Mall. We see the same stores, the\nsame packs of kids roaming the three tiers.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON MARK RATNER\n</b>\nwho stands against the railing in his Cinema Four\njacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice\nCream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to\nthe outdoor front tables, and almost look his way.\nThe Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her\ncalling out after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tHey Mark! Turn around!\n\nRatner turns around, affects total and complete\ncool. He waves across the mall to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tCome over here!\n\nHe looks back at his post at the theatre, decides\nit's okay to step away. He walks across the mall.\n\n<b>INT. SWENSON'S\n</b>\nStacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her\nare two empty stools. After a moment, we see The\nRat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds\nthe seat next to him with the palm of his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTHE RAT \n</b>\tYou. Sit.\n\nStacy turns to look at him, smiles. She sits.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tHi, Mark.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTHE RAT \n</b>\tHi, Stacy. How are you?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tI'm fine.

I want you to have this\n\tpicture, so you won't forget what I\n\tlook like.

I don't\n\tknow how much I'll be around... \n\t\t(breaks down, takes\n\t\tpicture)\n\tBut I'll give you a call sometime.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSTACY \n</b>\tI'd like that.\n\nShe gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and\nwalks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way\nthings sometimes turn out. He slips the picture\ninto his pocket, a satisfied young man.\n\n<b>INT./EXT. SWENSON'S AND MALL\n</b>\nThe Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed\ninto his street clothes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE \n</b>\tShe wants it, Rat.\n\nThe Rat snickers, shakes his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI saw you.

I don't\n\twatch as much television as you.\n\tI'm trying to feel things more. I'm\n\tlearning a lot about people.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAMONE \n</b>\tWhat do you read?
