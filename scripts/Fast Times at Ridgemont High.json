RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT\n\nFrom the outside parking lot it looks like an\nenormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for\nall the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the\nparking lot or stand by the mall entrance.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL\n\nThere are three levels of stores underneath a\nmassive fluorescent roof. Different music comes\nfrom each store. It looks seventies-modern, but\nalready used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise\nthe mall, eyeing each other and acting cool.\n\nINT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nThe teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie\nuniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with\ntheir orders.\n\nA good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and\nsits. He wears a plastic name tag that says:\n\"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON.\"\n\nTwo Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme\nindifference, and take their orders into the back\nkitchen.\n\nINT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHEN\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #1\n\tI think he looks like Richard Gere.\n\nThe two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One\nof them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old,\nretired sex queen of Ridgemont High.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 (CONT'D)\n\tI think he looks like... Richard\n\tGere. (Bruce Springsteen)\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tDid you see his cute little butt?\n\nA third waitress enters.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #2 \n\tLet's talk about C-19.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 AND LINDA \n\tWe were!\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #2 \n\tI think I'll drop over and change\n\tthe shakers.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNo, be cool, that's Stacy's\n\tsection.\n\nThrough the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is\nthe fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with\njust the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a\nglass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 \n\tHe's too old for Stacy, she hasn't\n\teven started high school yet.\n\nA flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHow's it going.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDo you think that guy's cute?\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS #1 \n\tIn a blow-dryed kind of way.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDoes anyone else want to take his\n\ttable?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tDon't you like him?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tYeah, but I fucked up.

Stacy reluctantly exits.\n\nINT. SWENSON'S DINING ROOM\n\nStacy goes to Ron's table.\n\n\t\t\tRON \n\tSo you working hard or hardly\n\tworking?\n\nStacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and\nlaughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her\nsoulfully.\n\n\t\t\tRON (CONT'D)\n\tYou look like you could still be in\n\thigh school.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI know, everyone says that.\n\nHe stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tWhat can I get for you tonight.\n\n\t\t\tRON \n\tHow about your phone number?\n\nStacy smiles nervously.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHT\n\nA teenage boy stands in front of an in-mall theatre\nacross from Swenson's. He wears a stiff over-sized\ntuxedo suit. He is Mark \"The Rat\" Ratner, a ticket\ntaker on the job.\n\nMike Damone, a transplanted Easterner, bops over\nfrom the record store, eyeing every girl he passes.\nHe stops at the movie theatre.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tDo you ever look at those girls who\n\twork at Swenson's? They're\n\tbeautiful. And I have to stand out\n\there and watch them six nights a\n\tweek.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tYou should work for yourself.\n\nTwo Junior High Kids spot Damone, walk up to him.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tWhat can I do for you, gentlemen?\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #1\n\tYou the guy with the Van Halen\n\ttickets?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tI could be.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #2\n\tWhat do you want for something in\n\tthe first ten rows?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tTwenty bucks apiece.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #1\n\tThose tickets were only twelve\n\tfifty!\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tSo don't buy 'em.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #2\n\t\t(to friend)\n\tAll the other scalpers are sold\n\tout, Arnold.\n\nDamone reacts indignantly.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tScalper? You call me a scalper? I\n\tperform a service, my friends. The\n\tservice costs money. Now do you\n\twant the tickets or not?\n\nThe Kids look at each other.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #1 \n\tAre you sure you can't go any\n\tlower.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tThese are my special back-to-school\n\tprices.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR HIGH KID #2 \n\tWe'll take 'em.\n\nDamone reaches inside his pants pocket for a wad of\ntickets.\n\nEXT. CARL'S JR. - NIGHT\n\nAt the other end of the mall is a neon-lit Carl's\nJr. Hamburger Restaurant. If Swenson's was the warm\nup, this is the main attraction of the Ridgemont\nMall.\n\nINT. CARL'S JR.\n\nBack-to-school banners hang from the walls. Many\nkids are lined up at the counters. In the middle of\nthe kitchen, directing all the orders, is a\nseventeen year old named Brad. He moves\nconfidently, observing the fryer, checking cup\nsupply, and giving an affectionate squeeze to a\npretty cashier named Lisa. She lets him kiss her,\nbut only once.\n\nA teenage Customer shouts to Brad from the front\ncounter.\n\n\t\t\tCUSTOMER \n\tHey Brad! I waited till you came\n\ton! I wanted your fries.\n\nBrad smiles, walks over to the fryer and discards\nthe fries left from the previous shift. He shouts\nto the other employees as he puts in a new batch,\n\"his\" batch.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tWe need fifteen Superstars, David!\n\n\t\t\tFELLOW EMPLOYEE #1 \n\tOkay, Brad!\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tI'll take care of the fry orders!\n\tJust get me the Superstars!\n\n\t\t\tFELLOW EMPLOYEE #2 \n\tFish sandwiches!\n\nBrad spots three surfers sitting in the dining\narea. None of them are wearing shirts.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tHey you guys! You had shirts on\n\twhen you came in here.\n\nANGLE ON THE MAIN SURFER\n\na bleary kid sitting at the head of the table. He\nruns a hand through his long, stringy blond hair.\nAfter a time, he speaks.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tSomething happened to them, mon.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tCome on, Spicoli. Why don't you\n\tjust put your shirts back on? See\n\tthe sign?\n\nANGLE ON HANDWRITTEN SIGN IN WINDOW\n\nthat reads: \"No Shirts, No Shoes, No Dice\"\n\nINT. CARL'S JR.\n\nA store manager, Dennis Taylor, bustles up to Brad.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tAny problems?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tNo, just a couple of surfers with\n\tno shirts on. I took care of it,\n\tDennis.\n\nANGLE ON SURFERS\n\ngrumbling, putting shirts back on. It pains them.\n\nDennis heads back to his office when he sees\nsomething in the trash bin.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tDid you throw away those fries,\n\tHamilton?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tThey were left over from the last\n\tshift.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tThose were perfectly good fries,\n\tHamilton. \n\t\t(glares at Brad)\n\tPerfectly good.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tBut they weren't mine.\n\nBrad laughs, goes back to work.\n\nINT. MALL - LATE NIGHT\n\nIt is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy\nand Linda walk through the large empty mall.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHe gave me his card. \n\t\t(lovingly)\n\t'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\t\t(amused)\n\tShould we buy a frame for that?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tCome on, Linda, I haven't had a\n\tboyfriend all summer. You promised\n\twhen I started working at the mall\n\tthat my life would change... Do you\n\tthink he'll call this week?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tListen, Stace, you want to know\n\tabout guys? I'll tell you. They're\n\tmostly chicken. Before I met Doug I\n\tchased after every guy I thought\n\twas cute. I thought if I gave out a\n\tvibe they'd get the message and\n\tcall me up. Well, guess what? They\n\tdon't call.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tSo what did you do?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI called them. If I was sitting\n\tnext to a guy and I wanted to sit\n\tcloser, I'd sit closer. If I wanted\n\tto kiss him, I'd just do it. You\n\twant Ron Johnson? Grab him.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI can't do that.\n\nThey pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says:\nLINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tFace it. With some guys you have to\n\tmake the first move. A lot of guys\n\tare just... wussies.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tReally?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy, what are you waiting for?\n\tYou're fifteen. I did it when I was\n\tthirteen. It's no huge thing. It's\n\tjust sex. If you don't, one of the\n\tother girls will.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(cute)\n\tHe was hot, wasn't he?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIf I didn't have a fiance in\n\tChicago, I'd go for it.\n\nA young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and\nStacy.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL \n\t\t(breathless)\n\tAre you Linda Barrett?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL \n\tI'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us.\n\tJudy Hinton from May Company told\n\tme I could ask you something.\n\nLinda nods.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL (CONT'D)\n\tI have this situation with my\n\tboyfriend, and I wanted to... \n\t\t(looks at Stacy, then\n\t\twhispers in Linda's ear)\n\nLinda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her\n\"sex expert\" mode.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tOkay, are you over sixteen?\n\nThe Girl nods.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tAll right, what you want to do is\n\tgo to the Free Clinic and tell the\n\tdoctor that you have sex regularly \n\t- several times a week -- and that\n\tyou need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL \n\tAnd they don't call my parents?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNot if you're over sixteen.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tOkay. Thanks a lot, Linda.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tAnd don't let them talk you into a\n\tdiaphragm either.\n\nThe Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to\nthe back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to\nopen the door.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI can't believe I start high school\n\ttomorrow.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tBelieve it.\n\nThey exit the mall, into the night.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n\nWe see all the elements of the first day of school.\nThe students carry new books, explore new lockers,\nbegin to stake out their ground.\n\nSomeone has taken the steel letters from the green\nvanguard out front. It reads: \"IDG MON SENOR HI\nHO.\"\n\nThe rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet\npaper. And a black spray paint message along the\nside of the front office building reads, \"LINCOLN\nSURF NAZIS.\"\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nBrad pulls into the Ridgemont High parking lot. He\ndrives a beat-up, four-door model LTD sedan. Three\nfriends wait for him near his parking space.\nThey are dressed in the same golf caps with brand\nlogos on the front like CAT, NATIONAL and CHAINSAW.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #1\n\tHamilton!\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #2\n\tThe cruising vessel! Hey -- Yooooo!\n\nBrad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tSix more payments, gentlemen.\n\nBrad joins his friends, and they walk towards the\ngymnasium.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT\n\nWe see a shiny, new, blue Mustang whip into the\nparking lot. Students scatter from the parking\nspace. Behind the wheel is football star Charles\nJefferson. A huge, black kid. The halls at\nRidgemont part for Charles Jefferson.\n\nRat and Damone are in the parking lot. Damone\nsurrounded by underclassmen (customers) selling\ntickets.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tSee that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave\n\tCharles Jefferson that car when he\n\twas a sophomore.\n\nThe underclassmen are impressed. They watch as\nJefferson opens his car door and stands to his full\nheight, over six-foot tall. He opens his trunk and\npulls out no books, just a football duffel bag. He\nslowly walks by Damone, Rat and the underclassmen.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tHow ya doing! That car looks great,\n\tCharles!\n\nJefferson gives Damone a death glare.\n\n\t\t\tJEFFERSON \n\tDon't... fuck... with... it.\n\nHe moves on. Damone resumes selling tickets.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tShit, that's my man.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT\n\nWe see a clutching, smooching couple walk by.\nCheerleader Cindy Carr and her boyfriend, Gregg\nAdams.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nThe Four Stoners (from Carl's Jr.) tumble out of a\nvan in the parking lot. They head towards the\ngymnasium.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - DAY\n\nStanding by the A-B-C-D-E registration counter in\nthe gymnasium, Brad waits to pick up his red ad\ncard. He stands surrounded by his buddies. They nod\nvigorously at everything Brad says. As he talks,\nfellow students all say hello or pat him as they\npass.\n\nOne troubled-looking boy, Arnold, walks up to Brad.\n\n\t\t\tARNOLD\n\tBrad, can I talk to you a minute?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tArnold. What's happening?\n\nArnold speaks confidentially to Brad.\n\n\t\t\tARNOLD\n\tBrad, I really fuckin' hate\n\tMcDonald's, man. Ever since they\n\tstarted in with the chicken,\n\teverything went downhill.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tYou want to work at Carl's?\n\n\t\t\tARNOLD\n\tOh, man, if you could swing\n\tsomething there, I'd do anything\n\tfor you. I want to work with you\n\tguys.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tI can probably get you in there.\n\tJust let me talk to Dennis Taylor.\n\n\t\t\tARNOLD\n\tAll right!!\n\nBrad notices Stacy and nods with complete inner\ncool.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tHi, Brad.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tSis.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD'S BUDDIES\n\tHey, Stacy.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tHi...

U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY\n\nStacy barely slips in the door before the final\nattendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as\nthe teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the\nclassroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the\naisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed\nstep to the door at the front of the class, kicks\nthe door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in\ntheir frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her\nfirst high school class.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tAloha. My name is Mr. Hand.\n\nMr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard\nbefore his class. Every letter is a small explosion\nof chalk.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\t\t(almost sweetly)\n\tI have but one question for you on\n\tour first morning 'together.' \n\t\t(pause)\n\tCan you attend my class? Pakalo?...\n\tUnderstand?... History has proven\n\tus one basic fact. Man does not do\n\tanything that is not for his own\n\tgood. It is for your own good that\n\tyou attend my class. And if you\n\tcan't make it... I can make you.\n\nAn impatient knock begins at the front door of the\nclassroom.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tWe have a twenty-question quiz\n\tevery Friday. It will cover all the\n\tmaterial we've dealt with during\n\tthe week. There will be no make-up\n\texams. It's important that you all\n\thave your Land of Truth and Liberty\n\ttextbooks by Wednesday. At the\n\tlatest.\n\nThe knock continues.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tYour grade is the average of all\n\tyour quizzes, plus the midterm and\n\tfinal, which counts for one-third.\n\tGot it?\n\nThe mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on\nthe front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History\nclass dares mention it, much less answer it.\n\nStacy grips her desk with the tension of her first\nday.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tAlso. There will be no eating in\n\tthis class. You get used to doing\n\tyour own business on your own time.\n\tThat's one demand I make. I don't\n\tlike staying after class with you\n\ton detention. That's my time. I\n\tdon't like wasting it. Just like\n\tyou wouldn't want me to come to\n\tyour house some evening and discuss\n\tU.S. History on your time. Pakalo?\n\nHand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the\nsound at the door and opens the door an inch.\nJeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes\nglistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and\nstreaming down the back of his white peasant shirt.\nHe grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as\nattendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy\nturns to his friends.\n\n\t\t\tSTUDENT \n\tThat guy has been stoned since the\n\tthird grade.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tYes?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tYeah. I'm registered for this\n\tclass.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tWhat class?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tThis is U.S. History, right? I saw\n\tthe globe in the window.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND\n\t\t(appears enthralled)\n\tReally?\n\nSpicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in\nthe door.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tCan I come in?\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\t\t(swinging door open)\n\tOh, please. I get so lonely when\n\tthat third attendance bell rings\n\tand I don't see all my kids here.\n\nSpicoli laughs. He is the only one.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tSorry I'm late. This new schedule\n\tis totally confusing.\n\nMr. Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it\nwith utter fascination.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tMr. Spicoli?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tThat's the name they gave me.\n\nMr. Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces\nand sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket.\nSpicoli watches in disbelief. His hands are frozen\nin the process of removing his backpack.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tYou just ripped my card in two!\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tHey, bud. What's your problem?\n\nMr. Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tNo problem at all. I think you know\n\twhere the front office is.\n\nIt takes a moment for the words to work their way\nout of Jeff Spicoli's mouth.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tYou... dick.\n\nIn the tense moment that follows, no one in the\nclass is sure what might happen.\n\nMr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if\nhe ceased to exist and coolly continues his\nlecture.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tI've taken the time to print up a\n\tcomplete schedule of class quizzes,\n\tand the chapters they cover. Please\n\tpass them back to the desks behind\n\tyou...\n\nHand begins passing out stacks of purple\nmimeographed sheets.\n\nANGLE ON STUDENTS\n\nall smelling the purple mimeographed sheets.\n\nStill standing in the doorway, hyperventilating\nwith fifteen-year-old adrenalin, is Jeff Spicoli.\nAfter a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card\nout of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT LUNCH COURT - AFTERNOON\n\nIt's packed. The school's outdoor dining area is\nactually just a small courtyard lined with fast\nfood machines and dominated by a large oak tree in\nthe center. Standing at the center of lunch court,\nunder the large oak tree, is Brad Hamilton and his\ngolf-cap Buddies.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tYou hear about the surfer in Mr.\n\tHand's class?\n\nHis Buddies shake their heads.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD (CONT'D)\n\tTold Hand to fuck off.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD'S BUDDIES \n\tWhoa!_\n\nBrad sees another friend pass through lunch court.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tThompson!\n\nBrad waits for him to pass.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD (CONT'D)\n\tI hear Thompson got canned at Bob's\n\tthis summer.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #1 \n\tYeah. They hacked his hours, so he\n\tquit.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tWhere is he now?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #1 \n\tMaking two eighty at Seven-Eleven.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tMan.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tThey make you wear a fuckin' candy\n\tstripe suit over there.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #2 \n\tPoor guy.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tPoor guy.\n\nEXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON THE 200 BUILDING\nBATHROOM\n\nnear the outer rim of lunch court. Jeff Spicoli\ncomes stumbling out into the daylight, surrounded\nby a small group of Ridgemont Stoners. Marijuana\nsmoke billows out behind them.\n\n\t\t\tSTONER BUDDY #1\n\tIt was so bitchin', mon. Everybody\n\tis talking about it.\n\n\t\t\tSTONER BUDDY #2\n\tTotally.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tThe motherfucker pissed me off.\n\n\t\t\tSTONER BUDDY #2\n\tTotally. You don't have to take\n\tthat shit.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tI didn't take that shit.\n\nThey all laugh, flip hair out of their eyes.\n\n\t\t\tSTONER BUDDY #1 \n\tTell us again. What happened after\n\the ripped up your ad card?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI called him a dick. And then I\n\treached for his class notes, and I\n\tripped 'em up. I said, 'Hey bud.\n\tTwo can play this game.'\n\nThe Stoners go wild.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tI'll tell you this.

They look\nout at lunch court, see it teeming with straight\nkids. They turn and walk towards the parking lot.\n\nEXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON STACY AND LINDA\n\nas they walk onto lunch court. They take a seat on\nthe outskirts of the area and watch all the\nstudents crowding onto the eating area.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI hear some surfer pulled a knife\n\ton Mr. Hand this morning.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tNo way! He just called him a dick.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tGod. People exaggerate so much at\n\tthis school.\n\nThe school couple, Cindy and Gregg walk by.\n\n\t\t\tCINDY \n\tHi, Linda.

Gregg and Cindy move on, repeating\nthe same scene a few feet away.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIf there's one thing that never\n\tchanges... it's a cheerleader.\n\nStacy turns to see a girl with short, black hair\npassing by, wearing tight black spandex pants, and\ndark lipstick.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tLinda. That girl looks just like\n\tPat Benatar.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI know.\n\nThey watch her pass.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tActually, there are three girls at\n\tRidgemont who have cultivated the\n\tPat Benatar look.\n\nLinda gestures out on lunch court.\n\nANGLE ON ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE\n\nwearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black\nhair with dark lipstick.\n\nANGLE ON STILL ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE\n\nwearing blue spandex pants and short black hair.\nShe stands a good distance away from the other two.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tNone of them talk to each other.\n\nLinda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is\nwondering.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDo you think guys find that\n\tattractive?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tOh, give me a break, Stacy. You're\n\tmuch prettier than them.\n\nThey sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her\nperennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tYeah but they look more\n\tsophisticated. You'd probably think\n\tthey'd be better in bed.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat do you mean 'better in bed.'\n\tYou either do it or you don't.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tNo there are variables that, like,\n\tI might not be good at.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat variables?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(shyly)\n\tLike, you know, giving blow jobs.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat's the big deal?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWell I never did it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tThere's nothing to it.\n\nShe takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her\nthroat. Stacv tries one but chokes.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tYou just have to practice a little\n\tfirst. \n\t\t(feels her throat)\n\tRelax these muscles. Think of your\n\tthroat as an open tunnel.\n\nThe girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their\nthroats without gagging.\n\nANGLE ON A BOY\n\nat the next table; sees them and points them out to\nhis companions.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhat happens... don't laugh at me,\n\tbut when a guy has an orgasm... you\n\tknow, like, how much comes out.\n\nStacy stops practicing and looks horrified. Linda\nlaughs.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tJust kidding. About 10cc.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(enlightened)\n\tOh! That's where that group got its\n\tname from.\n\nThey continue practicing as the boys look on. Stacy\nmanages to get almost a whole carrot down her\nthroat to Linda's amazement.\n\nThe group of boys break out in applause.\n\nStacy looks very embarrassed.\n\nINT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY\n\nThe class is situated so that all students sit at\nBunson burner tables lining the room.\n\nPat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes\na seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of\nher. It contains a pig embryo. She listens to the\nconversation next to her.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL STUDENT \n\tI'll tell you right now. I'm not\n\tgoing.

Stacy pulls\nback the covers. She is fully dressed.\n\nEXT. STACY'S WINDOW - NIGHT\n\nWe see the window to Stacy's room slide slowly\nopen, and watch her slip outside. She hikes down a\ndrainage pipe to the street.\n\nEXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT\n\nA brown MG pulls up. Stacy jumps from the shadows\nand hops in. The car drives away.\n\nINT. RON'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nRon sits behind the wheel, humming casually along\nto the music on his car stereo.\n\nRon has on a light-brown leather jacket.

THE POINT - NIGHT\n\nStacy and Ron sit in the car, listening to music.\nThe \"point\" is a natural lookout spot that lovers\ncan \"discover.\" It is behind the baseball field and\ndugout of Ridgemont High School.\n\nStacy and Ron get out of the car and walk to the\nbaseball dugout.\n\nINT. DUGOUT - NIGHT\n\nThey sit side-by-side. Above them, a single light\nbulb shines a very private fifty watts on things.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tThat's a nice shirt.\n\n\t\t\tRON\n\tThanks. Thanks a lot.\n\nSilence. They look at each other, look away.\n\n\t\t\tRON (CONT'D)\n\tIt's very warm out tonight.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tIt is. It's very warm. I wonder how\n\tlong it will last?\n\nRon leans over and kisses Stacy lightly on the\ncheek. Stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking,\nwas that the first move? Then she lunges at Ron and\nkisses him square on the mouth. At first surprised,\nRon then holds her there and kisses her in return.\nAfter a time, he breaks away.\n\n\t\t\tRON\n\tAre you really nineteen?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tYes... I am really nineteen.\n\nThey continue making out.\n\n\t\t\tRON\n\tI think I better take you home.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tWhat about those other guys you\n\tlive with?\n\n\t\t\tRON\n\tNo. I mean back to your home.\n\nBut they make no moves in any direction. They\ncontinue making out. Ron begins unbuttoning her\nblouse and massaging Stacy's breasts. A moment\nlater, he tugs at her pants. Awkwardly, she starts\nto help him. He tilts her backward onto the\nconcrete dugout bench. They kiss feverishly, her\nhand pulling off her shoes, then her pants. Ron\ngoes to work.\n\n\t\t\tRON (CONT'D)\n\t\t(whispers)\n\tIs this your first time?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tYes.\n\nSTACY'S POINT OF VIEW\n\nas she feels a man enter her for the first time, we\nsee the graffiti above her:\n\t\t\t\t\tSurf Nazis \n\t\t\t\t\tLincoln was here --  Sieg Heil \n\t\t\t\t\tLed Zeppelin \n\t\t\t\t\tDan y Roberto (Disco Fags)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nEXT.

HAMILTON HOME - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nStacy arrives home. The Hamilton home has that\nanonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others\nin this lower-middle class neighborhood.\n\nBrad washes his car in the driveway and listens to\nthe car radio.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tMom says to clean up the pool.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhy can't you do it?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tYour friends use the pool.

HAMILTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nThe furniture in the Hamilton living room looks\nlike it was gleaned for a sale at Pic 'N Save.\nThrough the living room, one can see a very small,\nkidney-shaped pool.\n\nStacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet\nnear the refrigerator. There are two names on it:\nBRAD/STACY. Brad's side is filled with messages.\nStacy's is empty.\n\nShe notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement.\nStacy reads the attached note. It reads: \"Memories\nof You, Ron Johnson.\" She quickly gathers it up and\ncarries it back outside. She fans the door several\ntimes to dispel the odor.\n\nEXT.

DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nDamone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters\nfull of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk.\nMusic is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands\nThe Rat a drink and checks himself out in his\nmirror.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tSee that moustache coming in, Rat?\n\nThere is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms\nit anyway.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tSee?

'I don't\n\tknow'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand,\n\twill I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr.\n\tSpicoli, I don't know'. I like\n\tthat.\n\tI think I'm going to leave your\n\twords on this board for all my\n\tclasses to enjoy. Giving you full\n\tcredit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.\n\nWe hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy and\nthe other students get up to leave. Spicoli stays\nin place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin'\ncomeback... and his mouth is forming the first\nword, when Mr. Hand cuts him off.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tYou can go now.\n\nHand turns back to his desk. The rest of the\nstudents have already left. Spicoli's audience is\ngone. He shrugs and lopes out the door.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL - AFTERNOON\n\nIt's Christmas time at the Ridgemont Mall. All\nthree tiers are strung with neon lights, and we\nhear the sound of the bell-ringing Santas.\n\nINT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON\n\nStacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the\nChristmas season madness. They sit at the sundae\nbar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she\nmakes a sundae.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYou've got to get used to working\n\tChristmas. People are always\n\tscreaming and yelling... then they\n\tget home and they're all\n\tChristmasy.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI think Christmas brings out the\n\tworst in people.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI guess Ron hasn't called yet.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tNot since November.\n\nLinda nods her head, always the coach.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy, it doesn't look good for the\n\trelationship.\n\nStacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the\nscoops onto the stainless steel dish.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(sighs)\n\tDon't you think it meant anything\n\tto him. Even if I am fifteen?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy. What does it matter? He's a\n\tstereo salesman. You want to marry\n\thim? You want to have kids with\n\thim? You want this guy to come\n\thome, fifty years old, and he's\n\tstill got that little Pacific\n\tStereo badge on? Come on.\n\nANGLE ON GREGG AND CINDY\n\nwho are seated at a back table, feeding each other.\n\nStacy looks at her finished sundae.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI should quit this job. I'm going\n\tto get so fat working here...\n\tnobody will ever take me out.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy. How many times do I have to\n\ttell you? You are really going to\n\tbe beautiful... someday.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThanks a lot.\n\nLinda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss.\n\nWe follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room\nto serve the sundae.\n\nINT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAY\n\nWe see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in\nformation, hunched over, sneering and wearing\nsleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these\ndamaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen.\nThey pass to reveal this legend on their backs:\nLINCOLN SURF NAZIS.\n\nAngle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are\nstanding by the upcoming concert list posted on the\ndoor to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf\nNazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still\nwearing his Cinema Four jacket.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tThe business is changing, Rat. I'll\n\ttell you, these kids today... they\n\tdon't even listen to Aerosmith.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI hear they all dress like that at\n\tLincoln now.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tThere used to be three or four of\n\tthose guys. Now we see 'em every\n\ttime we come to the mall.\n\nDamone is approached by a couple of young ticket\nCustomers.\n\n\t\t\tCUSTOMER #1 \n\tGot any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tNo Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of\n\tBlue Oyster Cult tickets last time\n\taround. I was this close to working\n\tat 7-11. No Cult.\n\nSuddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone\nand his customers see someone menacingly coming\ndirectly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles\nJefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up.\nWith him is a thick, tough, miniature version of\nhimself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in\nfront of Damone.\n\n\t\t\tJEFFERSON \n\t\t(after long look)\n\tWhen is Earth, Wind and Fire\n\tcoming?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\t\t(respectfully)\n\tI'm really not sure. I haven't\n\theard anything yet, but I'll let\n\tyou know the second there is the\n\tslightest news, sir.\n\n\t\t\tJEFFERSON\n\tI'm taking my little brother.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tExcellent. So that will be two\n\ttickets... All right. Fine, sir.\n\nJefferson and L.C. push past the customers.\n\n\t\t\tCUSTOMER #2 \n\tWow. He really lives here. I\n\tthought he just flew in for the\n\tfootball games.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\t\t(gaining composure)\n\tShit, he's my man. He knows where\n\tto come for tickets.\n\nDamone turns to The Rat.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tWell, Rat. Are you ready for the\n\tmoment of truth?\n\nThe Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tShe is immune to my charms.\n\nThey walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat\ndrapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his\nshoulders, like a French film director. Damone\nwalks a few steps, then stops Rat.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHey, Rat.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tAce the jacket.\n\nThe Rat considers the suggestion, gets rid of the\njacket. They continue towards Swenson's.\n\nEXT. SWENSON'S - DAY\n\nThe Rat pulls open the door to Swenson's. He walks\ntoward the counter to Stacy Hamilton.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHi. May I help you?\n\nThe Rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but\nbarges through nonetheless.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tYes. I have two questions. I was\n\tcurious...\n\nHis voice becomes a shade deeper. He begins to pull\nThe Attitude together.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\tWhat do you do with the jackets\n\tpeople leave here?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(smiling)\n\tWe keep them.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tYou keep them.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWe keep them, in case the people\n\tcome back.\n\nShe reaches under the counter and pulls out a\ncardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other\nitems.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tHere they are. You can look through\n\tit, if you want.\n\nThe Rat chuckles to himself, struggling with The\nAttitude.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tIt's cool. It would take too much\n\ttime to go through all that stuff.\n\tI'll just pick up a new one.\n\nStacy smiles. He's obviously awkward, and she likes\nit.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhat's your other question?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tMy other question is... can-I-have\n\tyour-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you\n\tout-sometime?\n\nTo The Rat's surprise, Stacy continues smiling.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDo you have a pen? This one's out\n\tof ink.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tOh... yes.\n\nHe pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to\nher. Stacy writes her name and phone number on a\nscrap of paper and gives it to him. The Rat looks\nat the paper.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\tStacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My\n\tname is Mark Ratner.\n\nHe sticks out his hand, and they shake. We see The\nRat turn around and walk out of Swenson's.\n\nEXT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON\n\nThe Rat exits with ultimate cool. He sees Damone\nwaiting just off to the side, talking to some\ngirls. The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up.\nDamone returns the gesture. All-Attitude.\n\nEXT. CARL'S JR. - MORNING\n\nCarl's is happening tonight. There are lots of kids\ninside. We hear charging rock music -- \"Girls Got\nRhythm\" by AC/DC -- coming from a radio in the back\nkitchen.\n\nINT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNING\n\nInside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the\nCarl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message\nnear the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses\nand catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his\nhair.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\t(talking to mirror) \n\tLisa? I have something to tell you.\n\tLook, I'm a senior now.\n\tI'm a single, successful guy and\n\tI've got to be fair to myself.\n\tLisa... I think I need my freedom.\n\nBrad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD (CONT'D)\n\tAw, don't do that... don't take it\n\tpersonally, okay? Please? I knew\n\tyou'd understand, because...\n\nThe bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who\nBrad got a job.\n\n\t\t\tARNOLD \n\tBrad! I know you're on your break,\n\tbut would you cover me on register\n\tthree?\n\nBrad nods, exits:\n\nINT. CARL'S JR. COUNTER\n\nBrad stands at the register.\n\nWe see a prominent display over Brad's head: TRY\nOUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. The last of many\nharried businessmen customers gets his breakfast\norder and takes his seat.\n\nBrad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant\nManager.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tCome on. Clean that counter off\n\tBrad. Let's go. Play ball.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tOkay, Dennis.\n\nBrad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor\nreturns to his office at the back of the kitchen.\n\nBrad watches him disappear behind the door that\nsays: ASSISTANT MANAGER.\n\nAs soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the\none Businessman in the place rises and returns to\nthe counter.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD (CONT'D)\n\t\t(nervously)\n\tMay I help you?\n\nThe Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He\nspeaks in a whine.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\tYes. This is not the best breakfast\n\tI ever ate.\n\nThe Businessman points to the huge display over\nBrad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\n\tAnd I want my money back.\n\nBrad begins searching under the counter.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tWell, I believe you have to fill\n\tout a form. There's a pad right\n\taround here.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\tNo. I want my money back right now.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tWell, that's not the way it works,\n\treally. And you ate most of your\n\tfood already, too...\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\tSee that sign? It says 100% Money\n\tBack Guarantee. Do you know the\n\tmeaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do\n\tthey teach you that here? Give me\n\tmy money back.\n\nBrad begins looking to the restroom. \"Where's\nArnold?\"\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tI can't do that. But if you wait a\n\tminute...\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\t\t(as if talking to a\n\t\tkindergartner)\n\tLook. Just put your little hand\n\tback in the cash register and give\n\tme my $2.75 back. Okay? \n\t\t(looks at name tag)\n\tPlease, Brad?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tI'm sorry, sir. Just let me find\n\tthe forms here.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN\n\tI am so tired. I am so tired of\n\tdealing with morons. How hard is it\n\tto...\n\nBrad looks up from under the counter. No amount of\npay will make him take that kind of insult.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tMister, if you don't shut up, I'm\n\tgonna kick 100% of your ass.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN\n\tManager!!\n\n\"Bam!\" The door to the Assistant Manager's office\nswings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the\nback.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tCan I help you, sir? Is there a\n\tproblem?\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\tYou bet there's a problem! Your\n\temployee used profanity and\n\tthreatened me with violence! I'm\n\tshocked, frankly. I've eaten here\n\tmany times and I've always enjoyed\n\tthe service -- until today!\n\nAngle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold\nstarts towards the register. He quickly sees the\nincident with the irate Businessman and ducks back\ninside the bathroom.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)\n\tAll I wanted was my money back for\n\tthis breakfast. It was a little\n\tundercooked. And this young man\n\tthreatened me. Now I plan to write\n\ta letter! I plan to...\n\nDennis wheels around to Brad.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS \n\tDid you threaten this man or use\n\tprofanity in any way?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tHe insulted me first. He called me\n\ta moron.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS\n\tDid you threaten this customer or\n\tuse profanity in any way?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tYes, sir.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS\n\tYou're fired.\n\nBrad looks around, expecting his friends to defend\nhim. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their\nwork. Brad is stunned.\n\n\t\t\tDENNIS (CONT'D)\n\t\t(to Businessman)\n\tI'm very sorry this happened to\n\tyou, sir.\n\n\t\t\tBUSINESSMAN \n\tThank you very much.\n\nThen Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it\non the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out\nof the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom\ndoor with his fist.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tI hope you had a hell of a piss,\n\tArnold.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nINT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAY\n\nHe arrives back in his room and locks the door. He\nyanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it\ninto the trash. Then he takes it back out of the\ntrash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic\nframe in half.\n\nDARKNESS\n\nWe are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a\nmoment, a pinprick of light appears in the\ndistance. We head towards the light. We are being\nled somewhere important.\n\nAs we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to\nreveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear\nthe voice of Merv Griffin.\n\n\t\t\tMERV GRIFFIN (O.S.) \n\tWill you please give a warm welcome\n\tto... Jeff Spicoli!\n\nThe Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv\nGriffin Show version of AC/DC's \"Highway to Hell\".\nSomeone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works\nthe studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the\nwords to \"Highway to Hell\": Merv Griffin show\nstyle.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\t\t(singing)\n\t'Layin' ladies!\t\t   \n\tDrinkin' wine!\t\t\n\tYou gotta dollar --\n\tYou're a friend of mine!     \n\tGettin' loose!\t\t\n\tFeelin' fine!\t\t\t\n\tYou and me -- It's get down time!\n\tWe're on the Highway to Hell!   \n\tThe Highway to Hell!'\n\nSpicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. The\naudience goes wild as Merv Griffin greets him\nwarmly, and guides Spicoli to his seat. Spicoli\nmotions for the cheers to die down. Griffin is\nobviously happy to see him. He touches Spicoli's\narm lightly.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN \n\tHow've you been?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tOutrageous, Merv. Nice to be here.\n\tI feel great.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN \n\tI was going to say... your eyes\n\tlook a little red.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI've been swimming, Merv.\n\nThe audience howls. It's a famous Spicoli line.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tSeriously, Merv, everything is\n\tgreat.\n\tI was thinking about picking up\n\tsome hash this weekend, maybe going\n\tup to the mountains.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN \n\t\t(concerned)\n\tI wanted to talk a little bit about\n\tschool, if I could...\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tSchool.\n\t\t(sighs)\n\tSchool is no problem. All you have\n\tto do is go to get the grades. And\n\tif you know something, all you have\n\tto do is go about half the time.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN \n\tHow often do you go?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI don't go at all.\n\nThe audience is howling again. He is Merv's\nfavorite guest.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN \n\tI hear you brought a film clip with\n\tyou. Do you want to set it up for\n\tus?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tWell, it pretty much speaks for\n\titself. Peter, you want to run with\n\tit?\n\nEXT. A MASSIVE WAVE - DAY\n\nThe film clip begins. It is a mammoth wave cresting\nagainst the blue sky.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (V.O.) \n\tMerv, this is the action down at\n\tSunset Cliffs at about six in the\n\tmorning.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN (V.O.) \n\tFascinating.\n\nA tiny figure appears at the foot of the wave.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN (CONT'D)\n\tWho's that?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tThat's me, Merv.\n\nThe audience gasps.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN (V.O.) \n\tAre you going to ride that wave?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tTotally.\n\nWe watch as Spicoli catches the perfect wave, and\nit hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water.\n\n\t\t\tGRIFFIN\n\tWhat's going through your mind\n\tright here, Jeff? The danger of it\n\tall?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tMerv, I'm thinking... I've only got\n\tabout four good hours of surfing\n\tleft before these little clowns\n\tfrom junior high start showing up\n\twith their boogie boards.\n\nThe audience is howling once again... when suddenly\nwe hear the loud noise of a door opening, followed\nby a shrill voice. It is Spicoli's eight-year-old\nbrother, Curtis.\n\nJeff Spicoli's dream of glory evaporates.\n\nINT. SPICOLI'S TRAILER HOME - MORNING\n\nIt is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by\nthe sea. Spicoli's area is small, but he has made\nit his own. The walls are covered with posters,\nalmost all of them naked centerfolds. It is obvious\nSpicoli's parents are not welcome in his room.\n\n\t\t\tCURTIS\n\tDad says you have to get up!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tUgh.\n\nHe groans, starts to struggle out of bed.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tLeave me alone!\n\n\t\t\tCURTIS\n\tDad says you're late again, you\n\tbutthole!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tLeave me alone.\n\n\t\t\tCURTIS\n\tDad says!\n\nSpicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed.\nHe pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the\ndoor and his little brother. It bounces off the\nwall and doesn't even hit Curtis, but the kid\nstarts crying anyway.\n\n\t\t\tCURTIS (CONT'D)\n\tDaaaaaaaad! Jeff threw a snorkel at\n\tme!!!!!!\n\nSpicoli gets out of bed, groans again, and kicks\nthe door shut.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM\n\ncelebrating the big game with rival Lincoln High\nSchool.

We see footage of a serene,\nmiddle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the\nglass windshield of a car. Judging from the other\nvehicles parked on the street, the film is from the\nearly Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi\nArnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent.\n\n\t\t\tARNAZ \n\tDriving ess an important part of\n\teach and every one of our da-ily\n\tlives. Ees a responsibility like no\n\to-ther and ess a matter of life\n\tand...\n\nA ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A\nsmall child runs out after it.

In the class, the\nDriver's Training students are howling.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - EARLY EVENING\n\nThe parking lot is full. Kids and shoppers stream\nthrough the entrance in groups of all sizes.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL\n\nAll three levels are teeming with kids.\n\nANGLE ON THE VIDEO PINBALL ARCADE\n\nwhere we see Jeff Spicoli manning the Missile\nCommand machine. Spicoli wears a red bandana across\nhis forehead. A cigarette dangles from his mouth.\nHe is surrounded by a fleet of young surfers who\nlisten to him with reverence.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tBe noble. Be aggressive. The thing\n\tabout Missile Command is to\n\tdecimate before you can be\n\tdecimated. Just like in real life. \n\nThe youngsters hang on every word of the sage\nadvice.\n\nANGLE ON A GANG OF SURF NAZIS\n\nwalking in formation.\n\nANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE AND MARK RATNER\n\nwalking the mall.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tCheck it out, Rat. The Surf\n\tNazis... out for a Sunday stroll.\n\nDamone and The Rat walk on. The Rat is barely\ninterested. He appears deep in thought.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tWhat do I say after she gets in the\n\tcar?\n\nDamone, obviously in his element here at the mall,\nstops to flash a winning smile at a well-built\nolder housewife.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tNo problem, Rat. What you need is\n\tmy special Five Point Plan.\n\nAs he talks, Damone passes a Country Farms shop. He\nplucks a free sample of cheese and sausage.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tKnock it off, Damone. I need real\n\thelp.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tWhat do you mean? Men have died\n\ttrying to obtain this information.\n\tI will give it to you for free.\n\nThe Rat and Damone continue on.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tOkay. Tell me. What's the Five\n\tPoint Plan?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tAll right. Pay attention.\n\nThe Rat nods, always the student, as they pass a\nWherehouse Record store. Damone stops right in\nfront of a seductively posed life-sized cardboard\nstand-up of Debbie Harry, the alluring rock singer.\n\nDamone begins his speech.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tFirst of all, Rat... never let on\n\thow much you like a girl.\n\nDamone turns to the cardboard cutout of Debbie\nHarry to demonstrate.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(disinterested)\n\tOh. Hi.\n\t\t(turns back to The Rat) )\n\tTwo. Always call the shots.\n\nHe turns to Debbie Harry, who looks on with an\ninviting cardboard smile.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tKiss me.\n\t\t(to The Rat)\n\tThree. Act like wherever you are,\n\tthat's the place to be.\n\t\t(to Debbie Harry;\n\t\tdebonair) )\n\tIsn't this great?\n\t\t(to The Rat)\n\tFour. When ordering food, find out\n\twhat she wants and then order for\n\tboth of you... it's a classy move.\n\t\t(to Debbie Harry; Cary\n\t\tGrant)\n\tAnd the lady will have...\n\t\t(to The Rat)\n\tFive. And this is most important.\n\tWhen you get down to making out,\n\twhenever possible, put on the first\n\tside of Led Zeppelin IV.\n\t\t(to Debbie Harry;\n\t\tseductive)\n\tWhy don't you put this tape on? It\n\tsounds great in the back of my\n\tvan... why don't we listen from\n\tthere?\n\nANGLE ON DEBBIE HARRY\n\nwith the same inviting smile.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tAnd that is how you talk to a girl,\n\tRat. Voila. You can't miss.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI think I've got it. Once I get\n\tgoing, I'll be okay. But... how do\n\tI get started? I mean, I hardly\n\tknow her.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tYou wuss. It's no problem. One\n\tperson says something to the other\n\tand that's how it starts...\n\nStanding there in the front of the Wherehouse, The\nRat nods his head and smiles. He's finally\nbeginning to understand, and we...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n\nEXT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\nWe see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo.\nStacy sits beside him. They are driving the streets\nof Ridgemont.\n\nINT. THE RAT'S CAR\n\nThis is it. The Big Date. \"Led Zeppelin IV\" is on\nthe car stereo of his sister's van.\n\nFinally...\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThanks for coming to get me.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tSure thing.\n\nSilence.\n\nEXT. THE RAT'S CAR\n\nHe rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon\nfast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive.\n\nINT. THE RAT'S CAR\n\nYet another silence has fallen. Then, after a\ntime...\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tThis is a nice car.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tYeah. It's my sister's.\n\nSilence.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tDo you have Mrs. George for\n\tEnglish?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tYeah. She is pretty good.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tYeah. She is pretty good.\n\nEXT. ATLANTIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nThey pull into the parking lot of a steak and\nlobster house called The Atlantis.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tJoey at Cinema Four said this is a\n\tpretty good restaurant.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI've heard that, too.\n\nThe Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the\nlot, grateful that the long silence is over. He\nwalks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis.\n\nINT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHT\n\nThe Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a\nnearby table. They are given large wooden menus.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tDo you know what you want?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI think I'll have the Seafood Salad\n\tSpecial.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tExcellent.\n\nThe Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to\nfeel in control now. Then something hits him. The\npanic sweeps across his face.\n\nSlowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet.\nIt's gone.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tAre you all right?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\t\t(weakly)\n\tOh yeah.\n\nCool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\tDo you mind if I excuse myself for\n\ta moment?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tNot at all.\n\nJust as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress\napproaches the table.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS \n\tAre you ready to order here?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tWell... sure. \n\t\t(settles back down)\n\tShe will have the Seafood Salad\n\tSpecial. And I will have... the\n\tsame.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS \n\tAnything to drink?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tTwo Cokes.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS \n\tOkay. Thanks.\n\nThe Rat gets back up again, looking paler by the\nminute. He excuses himself and walks over to the\npay phone by the Atlantis toilets.\n\nThe Rat dials a number. Damone answers.\n\nINT. DAMONE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nHe is sitting in a chair, leaning onto the back two\nlegs, watching television.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tYo.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (V.O.) \n\tDamone. It's Mark.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tMark. What happened to your date?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tIt's happening right now. I'm here\n\tat the Atlantis. Everything's fine\n\texcept... I left my wallet at home.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tDid you go home and get it?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tNo. It's too late. The food is\n\tcoming and everything. Damone, I've\n\tgot to ask you this favor, and I'll\n\tnever ask you for anything again in\n\tthis lifetime or any other. Will\n\tyou please borrow your mom's car,\n\tgo by my house, get my wallet, and\n\tmeet me back here?\n\nThere is silence.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\tDamone, are you there?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\t\t(world-weary sigh)\n\tI'm really pretty busy...\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE'S TELEVISION\n\nas we see the flickering images of Leave It To\nBeaver.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tYou owe me for this one.\n\nINT. ATLANTIS\n\nThe Rat hangs up, mildly relieved, and returns to\nthe table.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nINT. STACY AND THE RAT'S TABLE - AN HOUR LATER\n\nThe Rat and Stacy have finished the meal, and\ndesert.\n\nANGLE ON THE CHECK\n\nas it sits in a little tray before The Rat.\n\nThe Waitress approaches the table. It is clear she\nwants to make room for other customers and bigger\ntips.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS \n\tAre you sure there's nothing else I\n\tcan bring you?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI'll have one more Coke... Do you\n\twant another Coke, Stacy?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\t\t(quizzical) )\n\tSure. I'll... have another Coke.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tTwo more Cokes.\n\n\t\t\tWAITRESS \n\t\t(sarcastic)\n\tTwo... more... Cokes.\n\nANGLE ON FRONT DOOR\n\nas Mike Damone finally walks in. Damone looks over\nthe diners, then feigns great surprise when he sees\nThe Rat.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHey, Mark. Is that you?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tDamone! You come here?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tI come for the seafood. It's great!\n\tHey... you know what, Mark? I found\n\tyour wallet the other day. You want\n\tit back?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tWow. I've been looking for that\n\tthing! Hey, Damone, have you met\n\tStacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike\n\tDamone.\n\nStacy smiles politely, with the slightest sparkle\nin her eye, as the Waitress returns with the two\nCokes.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tWell, I've gotta be running.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tOkay. See ya.\n\nANGLE ON STACY\n\nlooking strangely at the proceedings.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tNice to meet you, Stacy.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tNice to meet you.\n\nDamone leaves. The Rat takes a few quick gulps of\nCoke, and gets up to pay the bill. As he moves out\nof camera range, we see the strange look on the\nfaces of waitresses and diners.\n\nINT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATE EVENING\n\nThe Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de\nsac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tI had a really nice time tonight.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tMe, too. I'm real sorry someone\n\tbroke in and stole your tape deck.\n\nThe Rat nods glumly.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tI never thought it would happen at\n\tThe Atlantis. Jeez.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tDo you want to come inside?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tAren't your parents asleep?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tNo, they're away for the weekend.\n\tBrad and I are watching the house.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tOkay. Sure. I'll come in.\n\nWe see a confused but interested look on The Rat's\nface.\n\nINT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING\n\nThey walk in the front door. The Rat stands\nuncomfortably in the doorway to the living room.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tWhere's your brother?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI don't know. Probably out. Want\n\tsomething to drink?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tNo. That's okay.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tWell, I'm going to change real\n\tquick. I hope you don't mind.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tNaw. I don't mind.\n\nStacy turns her back and pulls up her hair.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tWill you unzip me?\n\nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE\n\nas the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This\ncan't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her\nbra, down to the small of her back. It's the first\ntime he's ever done anything like that.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tThanks!\n\nShe walks down the hall to her room, easing out of\nher dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her\nroom open.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tYou can come in, if you want!\n\nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE\n\nHe is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to\nwalk down the hall. His heart pounds into his\nthroat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's\nroom.\n\nINT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost\nseethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to\nnotice.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tSo... pretty nice house you've got\n\there.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThanks. So... \n\t\t(puts hands on hips)\n\tWhat do you want to do?\n\nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE\n\nas he struggles with the memory of Damone's words.\n\"Always call the shots.\"\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDo you want to see some pictures? I\n\tkept a lot of scrapbooks and\n\tpictures and stuff from junior\n\thigh. How stupid, right?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tSure.\n\nStacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the\nbooks from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe\nslip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him.\nHer knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The\nRat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the\naction of putting his arm around her. He almost\ndoes, but then reacts as she says suddenly...\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThis is me in the eighth grade. Did\n\tyou have Mr. Deegan?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\t\t(looking pained)\n\tOh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.\n\nHer knee grazes him again. Does she expect\nsomething?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\tLook, Stacy, I want you to know\n\tthat...\n\nThe Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem\nto cross the line. He can't make his move. He is\nwoeful as he completes the sentence.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT (CONT'D)\n\t... I've got to go home.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tDo you really have to go?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tWell... it's getting kind of late.\n\nSuddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. He\nreaches one hand around her right shoulder and\nplants the other hand directly on her left breast.\nIt looks something like a wrestling hold. The Rat\nlooks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. The\nRat is absolutely frozen.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI guess it is getting late, Mark.\n\nShe shrugs him off, walks him to the door.\n\nEXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHT\n\nWe see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards\nhis car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't\nthat late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat\nturns and begins walking back up the Hamilton\nsteps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light\nclicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tYou blew it, asshole.\n\nBehind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont\nDrive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang.\n\nEXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHT\n\nJeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to\nhim is Little Charles, \"L.C.\", Jefferson's younger\nbrother. They're smoking grass and holding\nLowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is\nblasting the music of Rick James.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tHey, slow down. This is my\n\tbrother's car.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tI thought he was out of town.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tHe is.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tThen don't hassle it.\n\nThey speed off down Ridgemont.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tSeen the new Playboy?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tNaw.

The car behind him slows down.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tThis is a cop. He's definitely\n\tcruising me at busting distance.\n\nThe high beams switch on behind Spicoli.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tWhat the fuck is this guy doing?\n\nThe car behind Spicoli then advances to the point\nwhere it is now almost touching the blue Mustang.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tWhat the fuck is this guy doing?\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tThis ain't no cop.\n\nThe mystery car bumps them lightly from behind.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.

Die, Granada Jocks!\n\nSpicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and\neasily overtakes the Granada. Spicoli is proud of\nhimself. He checks himself out in the rearview and\nturns to L.C.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tWould you roll your window up,\n\tL.C.? It's messing my hair.\n\nSpicoli pulls way ahead of the Granada, while L.C.\nrolls his window up. Spicoli looks over to L.C. and\nsmiles wickedly.\n\nNow Spicoli wants to show off. He pushes the pedal\nto the floor.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tWe just missed the turnoff to the\n\tparty.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tYou know the thing I love about\n\tMustangs? The steering wheel.\n\nSpicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tWith a genuine Mustang steering\n\twheel, you can negotiate a hairpin\n\tturn with ease, my man.\n\nEXT./INT. MUSTANG\n\non the word \"ease\", Spicoli curls his finger into\none of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips\nit clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side\nstreet and head back to the party. But instead, at\nthe moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting\nto switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his\nfinger farther into the bubble than he expected.\nThe car swings in a complete circle, a circle that\nincludes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant\nrips the side of the car open like a can of tuna.\nThere is a silent moment of terror.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tAre you okay?\n\nThere is silence. Outside the smashed car, the\nGranada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C.\n\n\t\t\tGRANADA JOCKS \n\tFuck youuuuuuuuuu!\n\nThen L.C. stirs and utters his first words.\n\n\t\t\tL.C. \n\tMy brother is going to kill us.\n\tHe's gonna kill you and then he's\n\tgonna kill me.

It is just inches away from\nscrap iron.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI can fix it.\n\nMONTAGE OF SHOTS\n\nas we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big\nHomecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of\nshots of kids talking about it, wagering on the\nchances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many\nsigns and placards all over school, proclaiming\nRidgemont revenge. We see students lining up to\nvote for Homecoming King and Queen in the\ngymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has\nshown this year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nEXT.

They sadly shake their heads at the\nsight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.\n\nAs we draw closer, we see the center of commotion.\nIt is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles\nJefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it\nto the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the\nmessage: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT\n\nThe Ridgemont football bleachers are full of\ncheering students. We see the same basic groups\nfrom lunch court, and many more.\n\nThe cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr,\nDina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader\n\"husbands\" sit directly in front of them in the\nstands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with\nsome of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit\nseveral rows above them, watching.

The ball is snapped, and Charles\nJefferson comes directly at the player with both\nelbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The\nLincoln player is hit and keels over.\n\nCharles Jefferson sets up for another play. The\nball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another\nLincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was\nwho wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to\nspare any of them. There is pure madness in his\neyes. It has taken him over.\n\nThe Ridgemont points rack up.

Linda resumes applying the lotion.\nStacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats\npass.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHow long does Doug take?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI don't know.

It is Mark Ratner and Mike\nDamone. They are already wearing swimsuits.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHey! We came over to help you with\n\tMath homework!\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tOh, really?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tReally. We figured you needed the\n\thelp.

She leans over to Linda and speaks\nconfidentially.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tI think they're both virgins.\n\nStacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tI didn't ask for any help.

Okay?\n\nEXT. HAMILTON POOL\n\nMike Damone yells \"banzai!\" and dives into the\nsmall pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi,\nwhich is separated by a tile wall. Damone has\nalready poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the\ndetergent has created a huge bubble bath effect.\nDamone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi.\n\nStacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits\nkicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda\nstands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat\ntreads water and stares at both girls. Inside the\nHamilton living room, the family stereo plays the\nmusic of Deep Purple's \"Woman From Tokyo\".\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.\n\tI'm a champion diver myself.\n\nBrad arrives home by the side gate and slams it\nbehind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He\nwalks out onto the patio and stands with his hands\non his hips. For the first time, our former campus\nhero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from\nCaptain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and\nwhite striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit,\ncomplete with black plastic sword at the side, and\na ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad\ncarries the hat under his arm.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tDoes Mom know you have company?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tIt's just Linda. And Mark from\n\tschool.\n\nBrad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda\non the board in her maroon bikini.

He is just out of\nearshot when they begin talking about him.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tGod, he hardly even talks anymore.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI know. He hates to have to wear\n\tuniforms.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tPoor guy.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tReally.\n\nStacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water,\nsurfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the\nJacuzzi. She sits next to Damone, looking\nmischievous.\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI\n\ntalking while the others are at the other end of\nthe pool.\n\nANGLE ON THE RAT\n\ncasually catching sight of them together from the\nother side of the pool. We can read the emotions on\nThe Rat's face. He is still taken with Stacy, but\nhis big moment for her appears to have passed.\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI\n\nas they talk.\n\nUnderneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks\nagainst his. Then he feels her continue. Damone\nfeels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh. Moving\nupwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his\ntrunks.\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE\n\nas it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit.\nThis is uncharted territory, even for Mr. Attitude.\n\nANGLE ON LINDA\n\nwho is now sunning herself by the side of the pool.\nShe rubs her legs against each other, slowly,\nenjoying the hot afternoon.\n\nEXT.

Not right \n\tnow.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tChicken!\n\nLinda, for one, loses interest quickly. Standing by\nthe side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear\nand wiggles it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy! I've got water in my ears.\n\tDo you have any Q-Tips?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tGod, I don't think so. Better look\n\tin the house.\n\nLinda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton\nhouse.

She reaches out and grabs\nhim for a kiss, pulling him close. Then she pushes\nhim away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps\nthe top of her bathing suit. The incredible Linda\nBarrett's breasts fall loose.\n\nShe takes Brad's hands and places them on her, as\nshe begins unbuttoning his shirt.

Burt Reynolds.\n\nThere is no humor on Mrs. O'Rourke's face.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. O'ROURKE \n\tI realize it's important to have\n\tfun in your senior year, with your\n\tfriends, but there comes a time\n\twhen you have to get serious about\n\tyour future, think about college,\n\tand put aside all this fun.\n\nBrad looks up suddenly.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tYou know what, Mrs. O'Rourke? I\n\tbroke up with my girlfriend this\n\tyear. I lost my job at Carl's, and\n\ttwo other places. I wake up at 5:30\n\tto work at 7-11, then I go to\n\tschool, then I go back to 7-11. I\n\thave to pay rent, you know. My\n\tgrades haven't been that bad, and\n\tnow you're telling me that the fun\n\tis over. Well, I'm still waiting\n\tfor the fun to start.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. O'ROURKE \n\tBrad, I'll see you when I'm through\n\twith the rest of the seniors. If\n\tyou want to visit the career\n\toffice, go right ahead. I'll talk\n\tto you when you're more prepared.\n\nBrad gathers his books and opens the door to leave.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. OIROURKE\n\tNext!\n\nAn absolutely exuberant Cindy Carr pops her head in\nthe door.\n\n\t\t\tCINDY\n\tHi-yeeeeeeee!!!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT HALLWAY - MORNING\n\nThe bell has just rung, and Mike Damone comes out\nof Youth and Law class. He has an absorbed, driven\nlook on his face. He walks past the rows of\nlockers, and doesn't even notice as he passes Stacy\nHamilton standing by her locker. She smiles, grabs\nhis arm affectionately.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHi Mike!\n\nDamone turns to see her, is thoroughly unimpressed.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tOh. Hi.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI didn't see you this morning.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tLook, I'm kind of in a hurry.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI'm in a hurry too. I just thought\n\tI could say hi to you.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHello.\n\nHe pulls away, leaving a bewildered Stacy standing\nby her locker. She grabs some books and hurries in\nthe other direction.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY\n\nThe bus pulls up to the front entrance of\nUniversity Hospital. The students file out and\ncollect next to the front door. Mr. Vargas\ngleefully addresses the class. This is his favorite\nfield trip.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS\n\tToday we're going to explore how\n\tthis hospital works to preserve\n\thuman life.\n\tWe'll be visiting every floor,\n\tevery level where these fine\n\tdoctors and nurses take care of us,\n\tin life... and in death.\n\nINT. MATERNITY WARD\n\nThe class exits from a hospital elevator, onto\nanother floor. They are now standing outside the\nmaternity ward. We hear the loud noise of babies.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS\n\tOver thirty children are delivered\n\there each day...\n\nThe class moves on.\n\nINT. THE BOTTOM FLOOR\n\nThe class exits another hospital elevator.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS\n\tThis is part of your third quarter\n\texam, and I'd advise you to take\n\tcareful notes on what we're about\n\tto see.\n\nANGLE ON DR. MILLER\n\na young intern who has joined the class for the\nlast part of their tour.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS\n\tMay I just ask you one last time to\n\tconduct yourselves with the utmost\n\tmaturity...\n\nThe kids are beginning to get very nervous now as\nthey are led down the hall to the \"Cold Room.\" The\ndoor to the \"Cold Room\" has only one sign on it. It\nreads: CADAVERS -- MEDICAL EXAMINATION ONLY. Mr.\nVargas opens the door, and the class seems to gasp.\n\nINT. THE COLD ROOM\n\nThere are six examination tables in the \"Cold\nRoom\". Each of them contains a cadaver covered by a\nwhite sheet. Mr. Vargas has gathered the class\naround one table in particular. He fingers the edge\nof the white sheet as he talks.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS \n\tAs you know, all the bodies in this\n\troom are recently deceased human\n\tbio-structures.\n\nA student raises his hand.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS \n\tYes, Randy?\n\n\t\t\tRANDY \n\tWho are these guys?\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS \n\tMost of them were derelicts, Randy.\n\tThey sold the right for medical\n\texamination of their bodies for\n\tmoney. Something like thirty\n\tdollars, I believe. Isn't that\n\tright, Doctor Miller?\n\n\t\t\tDR. MILLER \n\tTwenty-five dollars.\n\nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI\n\nwho turns to Stacy.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tTwenty-five bucks is pretty good.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS \n\tNow this gentleman here is named\n\tArthur. Arthur died from heart\n\tfailure last week and we are\n\tfortunate enough to view his body\n\tin its pristine state.\n\nMr. Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and\nwe see the body of Arthur. The students' eyes\nwiden. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Others\nbegin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body of\nArthur is smallish and withered. It is orange,\nflaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut has\nbeen made in Arthur's chest.\n\nMr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better\nstudent view. He gestures to the deep cut made in\nArthur's chest.\n\nThe tension mounts.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS (CONT'D)\n\tThis incision allows us to pull\n\taside the skin covering of the\n\tchest cavity and really observe the\n\thuman organs as they exist in their\n\tnatural state.\n\nANGLE ON ARTHUR\n\nand his shrunken face, which seems to say please\ndon't.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS (CONT'D)\n\tI want all of you to take a look at\n\tthe chest cavity for just a moment.\n\nMr. Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chest\ncavity covering, and rips it open.\n\n\t\t\tMR. VARGAS (CONT'D)\n\tHere we have the human lungs and\n\theart, which you can see is\n\tactually located in the center of\n\tyour chest.\n\nWith a squish, Mr. Vargas reaches inside Arthur and\npulls out the human heart for display. The class\nstands in silent shock. Only one comment escapes\nfrom any of them.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tBitchin'.\n\nANGLE ON STACY HAMILTON\n\nwho goes running out of the \"Cold Room\", holding\nher mouth. The Rat runs after her.\n\nINT. BOTTOM FLOOR HALL\n\nRat and Stacy sit side-by-side on some orange\nplastic chairs, by a nurse's desk. Stacy is shook\nup.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI made a fool of myself.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tNobody noticed. Don't worry about\n\tit. We'll just stay out here until\n\teveryone comes out, we'll blend\n\tback in.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhat about the notes?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI'll get you the notes.\n\nShe squeezes his arm.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON\n\nThe students file out of the hospital, looking like\nthey've just been through a war.\n\nINT. LINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nIt is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching\nFantasy Island.\n\n\t\t\tMONTALBAN \n\tYou see, Tatoo, what this man\n\tdoesn't realize is that he must one\n\tday leave Fantasy Island. And he\n\tmust continue his life as an\n\tincurable leper.\n\nStacy is fighting back tears. Linda looks angry.\n\nTelephone rings. Linda jumps to get it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHello.\n\nLinda obviously is disappointed when she hears a\nfemale voice.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tYeah... you're kidding... What did\n\the say... What did you say... How\n\tmuch did it cost? Look, tell him he\n\tcan have a relationship with you or\n\ta 'more open' relationship with\n\tsomeone else... Listen, Debbie, can\n\tI call you later. I'm waiting for\n\tDoug to call.\n\nShe plops back on the couch with Stacy.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tI'll bet he forgets to call again.\n\nShe notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tGod, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's\n\tjust David Soul and Ricardo\n\tMontalban.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI don't know, I'm just so\n\tdepressed. Everything is just so...\n\tdepressing.\n\nLinda shuts off the television.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYou have been acting very strange\n\tthe last few weeks.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI don't know... I just don't feel\n\tright.\n\nLinda sits down next to Stacy on the bed.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat do you think it is?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWhat do you think it is?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIt couldn't be.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tIt could be. I had a pregnancy test\n\tat the clinic. I'll find out\n\tMonday. I guess it was Damone.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tOf course it was Damone. If it was\n\tRon Johnson, you'd be out to here!\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI'm not going to tell him. He's an\n\tasshole. I hate him.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tBut it costs money to have an\n\tabortion. Even at the Free Clinic.\n\tYou tell Damone to pay for it. It's\n\tthe least he can do. It's the guy's\n\tresponsibility too.\n\nShe puts the TV back on and they watch.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tYou know, there's one thing you\n\tdidn't tell me about guys.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tYou didn't tell me that they can be\n\tso nice, so great... but then you\n\tsleep with them and they start\n\tacting like they're five years old.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYou're right. I didn't tell you\n\tthat.\n\nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - TWO DAYS LATER\n\nStacy Hamilton is walking towards Mike Damone on\nthe football field. We see him from a distance,\ntiming track runners.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tWhat's going on?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tMike, there's something that's been\n\ton my mind and I have to tell you\n\tabout it.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tWhat? Now?\n\nHe clicks off the time on a runner, and then turns\nto face her.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tWhy don't you call me up tonight?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tMike. I want you to know that I'm\n\tpregnant.\n\nANGLE ON STACY\n\nas she looks down. They are words she never thought\nshe would be speaking.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHow do you know it's mine? We only\n\tdid it once.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI know it's yours.\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE\n\nas he realizes she is sincere, and he truly begins\nto panic.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tYou made me do it! You locked the\n\tdoor. You made me do it! You wanted\n\tit more than me!\n\nANGLE ON STACY\n\nShe does not flinch.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tTake that back.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tAll right, I take it back.\n\nANGLE ON DAMONE\n\nHe hugs his arms tighter across his chest, and\ndecides to try a more mature tact.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tThere's only one thing we can do.\n\tWe've got to get rid of it. We've\n\tgot to get an abortion.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tWe've got to get an abortion?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tYeah. My brother Art got his\n\tgirlfriend one once.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tIt's already planned, Mike. It's\n\tgoing to cost $150 at the Free\n\tClinic.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tDoesn't sound free to me.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tSo you want me to pay for it?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tHalf. Okay?\n\t\t(bites back tears)\n\tSeventy-five dollars. And a ride to\n\tthe clinic.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tSeventy-five dollars, and a ride.\n\tOkay.\n\nStacy stands there, hands folded, nodding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nINT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nHe is working at his desk, counting through a wad\nof money.\n\nANGLE ON THE LIST\n\nin front of him, which has a split line down the\nmiddle. People Who Owe Me -- fifteen dollars Rick.\nPeople I Owe -seventy-five dollars REO Speedwagon\ntickets, seventy-five dollars abortion. Damone\ncounts fifteen dollars into his stack, crosses out\nRick. Then he counts through the money. Seventy\nfive dollars exactly. He crosses out REO Speedwagon\ntickets. This leaves him no money for the abortion.\n\nEXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON\n\nHere, at the same corner where she once waited for\nRon Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone. Cars pass, no\nDamone.\n\nINT. HAMILTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON\n\nStacy is on the phone, calling Damone. We see the\nphone messages sheet that lists two calls for\nStacy, and none for Brad. The line rings four\ntimes, then it's answered.\n\n\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE\n\tHello?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHello... is Mike there?\n\n\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE \n\tHold on.\n\nStacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on\nthe kitchen wall. It's getting late...\n\n\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)\n\tHe says he's helping his father in\n\tthe garage and he'll call you back.\n\nStacy is stunned.\n\n\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)\n\tHello?\n\nStacy hangs up. She punches out another number,\nquickly.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. BARRETT (V.O.) \n\tHello?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there?\n\n\t\t\tMRS. BARRETT (V.O.) \n\tShe went off to the beach. She'll\n\tbe back later, though.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tOkay. Thanks.\n\nShe looks at the clock again, then hears a noise in\nthe driveway.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tBrad! Hey, wait a second!\n\nShe runs out.\n\nEXT. CRUISING VESSEL - AFTERNOON\n\nBrad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tYeah. This is it. I have some\n\tshopping to do.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tSee you later.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tThanks a lot, Brad. I really\n\tappreciate it.\n\nShe gets out of the car.\n\nEXT. FLEA MARKET\n\nStacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away. Then\nshe looks to both sides, and walks on. She passes\nthe entrance to the Flea Market. She walks around\nthe corner to another building marked BIRTH CONTROL\n- FREE CLINIC. Brad follows her in the rearview\nmirror.\n\nINT. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC\n\nStacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress. Her\nhair is stuffed in paper shower cap. She looks\nanxious. In a bed next to her an older girl is\nbeing affectionate with her visiting boyfriend.\n\nA Nurse comes in with an IV.\n\n\t\t\tNURSE\n\tThis is going to prick a little.\n\nShe sticks the needle into Stacy's hand. Stacy\nlooks pained but doesn't yell. The Nurse pats the\nrolling bed.\n\n\t\t\tNURSE (CONT'D)\n\tNow scoot over here.\n\nStacy moves onto it. Looking up from her point of\nview, we see the ride out of the room and into:\n\nINT. OPERATING ROOM\n\nStacy gets wheeled in. The Doctor looks down at\nher.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\tHello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell.\n\nStacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse\nand Doctor get ready.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tAny questions before we begin?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThis is going to hurt, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR \n\tWe'll use a local but you'll feel\n\tsome pressure. It doesn't last that\n\tlong.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDoes it hurt more to have a baby?\n\nThe Doctor pauses and considers her question.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR \n\tYes... but I think you mind it\n\tless.\n\nStacy looks up at the lights and listens to the\nsound of suction tubes.\n\nINT. B.C. WAITING AREA\n\nThe other girl and Stacy sit at a table eating\ntoast and jelly. The girl is reading. The Nurse\nenters.\n\n\t\t\tNURSE \n\tHow are we doing in here? Debbie,\n\tready to leave?\n\nThe girl nods and gets up.\n\n\t\t\tNURSE (CONT'D)\n\tRight through here. Stacy, I can't\n\tlet you go unless you have a ride\n\thome.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tUh, my boyfriend said held be\n\twaiting downstairs.\n\nThe Nurse studies her, decides she's telling the\ntruth and allows her to leave.\n\nEXT. ENTRANCE TO THE FREE CLINIC\n\nStacy walks back out into the sunlight, slowly and\nweakly. She is surprised and amazed at who she sees\nstanding outside, waiting for her.\n\nANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON\n\nHe stands, hands on hips, just outside the door.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tBrad!\n\nHe puts an arm around her and leads her toward his\nwaiting car.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tSince when do you shop at the Flea\n\tMarket anyway?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tBrad. Please don't tell Mom and\n\tDad...\n\nHe helps her into the cruising vessel. He starts up\nthe car and drives off.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tWho did it?\n\nStacy stares out the window. Tears well in her\neyes.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD (CONT'D)\n\tYou're not going to tell me, are\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tAll right, then. It's your secret.\n\nStacy smiles at Brad. Brad smiles back. The car\ndrives on.\n\nINT. LINDA'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStacy is in Linda's room, sitting on her bed. Her\neyes are red and moist from crying. Linda listens\nto her story.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI really thought he would show up.\n\tI waited... and waited... and\n\twaited...\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tThat little prick.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tThen I called his house, and his\n\tmother told me he was in the garage\n\thelping his father.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tThat little prick.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tI paid for it and everything.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tThere goes your stereo for another\n\tyear. Mike Damone is a no-brain\n\tlittle prick. I'm not letting him\n\tget away with this.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tDon't do anything, Linda. I'd\n\trather just forget about it. I\n\tdon't even like the guy.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tStacy, he's not a guy. \n\t\t(loud)\n\tHe's a little prick! \n\nStacy lies back on the bed.\n\nEXT. DAMONE HOUSE - MORNING\n\nThe front door to the Damone house opens, and out\nwalks Mike Damone carrying some books. He looks\ntroubled, burdened, and stares down at the walkway\nas he moves towards his car. He walks around,\nstarts to pen the car door, then he sees it. There,\nin white spray paint across the driver's door, is\nthe message: PRICK.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tShhhhhhhhhit.\n\nHe looks both ways, and starts back towards the\nhouse.\n\nEXT. DAMONE CAR\n\nMike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making\nthe turn into the school parking lot. There is a\nlarge cardboard panel taped on the side of his car.\n\nEXT. DAMONE'S LOCKER\n\nHe arrives at his locker, where, in white spray\npaint, there is another message: LITTLE PRICK.\nSeveral girls walk by, they laugh knowingly.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL #1 \n\tHi, Mike!\n\n\t\t\tGIRL #2 \n\tHi, mike!\n\nDamone backs up against the locker, with a sick\nsmile on his face.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tHi... girls.\n\nMore students pass, looking strangely at the young\nman pinned against his own locker.\n\nEXT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nDamone exits the boys locker room. Just as he does,\nhe is accosted by The Rat. We have never quite\nheard this tone in The Rat's voice before.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tDamone? What happened between you\n\tand Stacy?\n\nDamone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head. Damone\nsighs.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tLet me tell you something, Rat.\n\tSometimes girls just go haywire. It\n\twas a month ago, I've been trying\n\tto think of a way to tell you ever\n\tsince. We started messing around\n\tand... \n\t\t(shrugs)\n\t... something happened. It's all\n\tover with. It's no big deal. I\n\tnever called her again.\n\nThe Rat says nothing.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tIf you ask me, she's pretty\n\taggressive. You understand what I'm\n\tsaying?\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tNo Damone. I don't understand.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tShe wasn't really your girlfriend\n\tanyway.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tHey fuck you Damone. There's a lot\n\tof girls out there and you mess\n\taround with Stacy. What have you\n\tgot to prove?\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tJesus. I'm sorry.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT \n\tI always stick up for you. Whenever\n\tpeople say 'Aw, that Damone is a\n\tloudmouth' -- and they say that a\n\tlot -- I say 'You just don't know\n\tDamone.' When someone says you're\n\tan idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not\n\tan idiot. You just don't know him.'\n\tWell, you know, Damone, maybe they\n\tdo know you pretty good. And I'm\n\tjust finding out.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE \n\tFine. Get lost.\n\nDamone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves\nhis shoulder hard.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tAll right, Rat. You want to do\n\tsomething about it?\n\nDamone begins the classic high school fighting\nritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step\nback. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards\nhimself. Then Damone says the universally\nrecognized high school fighting words.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE (CONT'D)\n\tWell come on.\n\nThe Rat shows no fear. As other kids begin to crowd\naround the two boys, Rat throws his own books down.\nHe takes a step back, goes into the crouch. He\ngestures toward himself.\n\n\t\t\tTHE RAT\n\tYou come on.\n\nThey stand there, gesturing, neither one of them\nwanting to make the first move.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tNo. You come on, you wuss.\n\nAssistant Coach Mr. Sexton comes running out of the\nboy's locker room, and steps in front of the two\nboys.\n\n\t\t\tSEXTON\n\tHey! Knock this crap off!!\n\nThe Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of\nonlookers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT DRIVE - NIGHT\n\nThe Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars,\ncruising for parties. There is a lot of honking,\nand yelling out windows. Everyone is headed towards\nthe beach. We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the\nfreeway entrance.\n\nEXT. 7-11 STORE - NIGHT\n\nA yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the\nempty parking lot. It does not stop.\n\nThen, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli. We see\nhim in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep\ninto the pockets of baggy jeans. He walks inside\nthe store. He is the only shopper.\n\nINT. 7-11 STORE\n\nBrad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red\nand white striped shirt and cap, making fresh\ncoffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter. He\nlooks at Brad. Brad looks at Spicoli. There is an\nunspoken edge between them.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tHey, mon, can I use the bathroom?\n\nBrad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the\nback room door.\n\nANGLE ON\n\nsign which reads: Rest Room For Employees Only.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tGo ahead. Just make it quick.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tTotally.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tIt's the first door on your left.\n\nSpicoli disappears into the back room. Brad sighs,\nlooks at the clock. It reads: 11:15. Then he hears\nSpicoli from the back room.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (O.S.)\n\tI can't find it, mon!\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tIt's the first door on your left!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (O.S.)\n\tOn the ledge?\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tFirst door on your left!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (O.S.)\n\tThere it is!\n\nBrad sighs again. He loads a new filter into the\ncoffee maker.\n\nEXT./INT. 7-11 STORE\n\nA moment later, the yellow Firebird pulls into the\n7-11 parking lot. A man in a windbreaker comes\nhurtling out of the car, into the store. He spray\npaints the scanning camera above the door. He\nhustles up to the counter, produces a .45 Magnum\nand points it chest high at Brad. There is a glazed\nand nervous speedy edge to his voice.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER\n\tI want money. And I want it all --\n\tnow.\n\nBrad looks pale and young under the fluorescent 7\n11 light.\n\nHe speaks slowly.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tThey empty and close the big safe\n\there at midnight.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER\n\t\t(getting tougher)\n\tI know this store. I know where the\n\tsafe is.\n\nHe bangs the gun on the counter, hard.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER (CONT'D)\n\tOver there behind the donut case.\n\tNow move!\n\nBrad slowly moves to the donut case, like a zombie.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tI'm instructed to tell you that we\n\tare on a video alarm system and\n\tthere are other hidden cameras in\n\tthe store ...\n\n\t\t\tROBBER\n\tJust give me the money. Move it.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tOkay.\n\t\t(legs are shaking)\n\tI just started here, and they just\n\ttaught me the procedure. I'll give\n\tyou the money, just let me figure\n\tthis out.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER\n\t\t(very menacing)\n\tMove it. Move it.\n\nBrad opens the phony back of the donut case and\nfiddles with the strongbox combination.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER (CONT'D)\n\t\t(more menacing)\n\tLet's go, stupid.\n\nBrad looks at the gunman.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tYou motherfucker. Get off my\n\tfuckin' case.\n\nThe Robber is about to react when the bathroom door\nopens and Jeff Spicoli starts out, wiping his hands\non his pants.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tNo towels, mon...\n\nThe Robber turns to look at Spicoli, and that is\nall that Brad Hamilton needs. Just like it is the\nmost natural thing in the world, Brad reaches for\nthe hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and\nthrows it into the gunman's face and hands.\n\n\t\t\tROBBER\n\tAaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!\n\nThe .45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the\nfloor. The gunman is still grabbing his face, and\nlooking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad\nsnaps up the gun. In the parking lot, the gunman's\naccomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow\nFirebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of\nthe parking lot.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD\n\tThere goes your ride home.\n\nBrad pulls the under-counter alarm with newfound\nconfidence. Jeff Spicoli stands there, mesmerized\nat the entire event.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tAwesome. Totally awesome.\n\nEXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - NIGHT\n\nKids are pouring into the Ridgemont mall. Summer\nbanners are already up.\n\nINT. THE MALL - NIGHT\n\nIn the midst of all the kids and shoppers, we see\nThe Rat walking slowly down the promenade. He is\nwearing an Army surplus jacket, and his hands are\nburied deep in his pockets. \n\nTwo girls pass his way. One smiles briefly at him,\nand The Rat turns to watch her pass. He is about to\nsay something to her, then no. He walks on, sees\nSwenson's Ice-Cream Parlor up ahead. The Rat\ndecides to walk the other way.\n\nINT. SWENSON'S - NIGHT\n\nThe place is busy again, filled with shoppers and\nteenagers in summer-type clothing.\n\nWe see Stacy Hamilton, once again, at the cash\nregister wearing an Assistant manager name tag and\na hostess gown.\nShe handles a customer's bill, then stands there a\nmoment, looking glum. Linda Barrett approaches.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tAnother summer of working at\n\tSwenson's.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tCome on. There's lots of men around\n\there.

JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his\ncastle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A\nhuge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the\nwindow. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white\nshort-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's\nfat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his\nbong, all the while talking on the phone. The music\nof Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" plays on the radio.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI... am... so... wasted, mon. What\n\tis in this shit?\n\t\t(pause)\n\tDoesn't that stuff cause brain\n\tdamage?\n\t\t(pause)\n\tBitchin'.\n\nSpicoli listens for a moment. He rubs his eyes,\nshakes his head. He is really buzzed.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tHey, mon, I am going to Mexico as\n\tsoon as school is out. Two more\n\tweeks, bud. Week from Wednesday.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tI am gonna take both boards, my\n\tduck feet, many cases of beer, and\n\tjust jam.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tNo, mon, from school. I'm leaving\n\tas soon as school gets out. I'll be\n\tat Sunset Cliffs by nighttime.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tTotally.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tLater.\n\nSpicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his\ntie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the\ndoor to his room flies open and Spicoli's little\nbrother Curtis bursts in.\n\n\t\t\tCURTIS \n\tJeff you have company!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tGo away, Curtis. If you can't\n\tknock, I can't hear you.\n\nCurtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later\nthere is a knock.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tThat's better. Come in.\n\nThe door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in\nstoned shock at the sight before him. There,\nstanding in the doorway of his room is Mr. Hand.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tMr... Mr. Hand.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tThat's right, Jeff. Mind if I come\n\tin?\n\nSpicoli can only nod.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\t\t(calling downstairs)\n\tThank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli.\n\nHand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit\njacket and lays it on the chair back. He stops a\nmoment and catches the stare of Miss January\nPenthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tWere you going somewhere tonight,\n\tJeff?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tYeah. The Graduation Dance Mr.\n\tHand. It's the last school event of\n\tthe year.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tI'm afraid we've got some things to\n\tdiscuss here, Jeff.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tDid I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?\n\nHand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from\nanother chair and sits down. He sets his briefcase\non Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and\nopens it up for easy access.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tDo you want to sit there, Jeff?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tI don't know. I guess so.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tFine. You sit right here on your\n\tbed. I'll use the chair here. \n\t\t(pause)\n\tAs I explained to your parents just\n\ta moment ago, and to you many times\n\tsince the very beginning of the\n\tschool year -- I don't like to\n\tspend my time waiting for late\n\tstudents, or detention cases. I'd\n\trather be preparing the lesson.\n\nMr. Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks\nat it. \n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tAccording to my calculations, Mr.\n\tSpicoli, you wasted a total of\n\teight hours of my time this year.\n\tAnd rest assured that is a kind\n\testimate.\n\nHe returns the sheet to his case and looks into\nSpicoli's weed-ravaged eyes.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tNow, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare\n\tmoment for me. Now I have the\n\tunique pleasure of squaring our\n\taccount. Tonight, you and I are\n\tgoing to talk in great detail about\n\tthe Davis Agreement, all the\n\tassociated treaties, and the\n\tAmerican Revolution in particular.\n\tNow if you can just turn to Chapter\n\t47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tHey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tWell, then, I'm glad I remembered\n\tto bring an extra copy just for\n\tyou.\n\nHand reaches in his case and produces the book. He\nhands it to Spicoli.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\t\t\t\t\t  TO:\n\nINT. SPICOLI'S ROOM - HOURS LATER\n\nWearily, Spicoli is trying to grasp the material.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\t... so, like, when Jefferson went\n\tbefore the people what he was\n\tsaying was 'Hey, we left this place\n\tin England because it was bogus,\n\tand if we don't come up with some\n\tcool rules ourself, we'll be bogus,\n\ttoo!' Right?\n\nANGLE ON MR. HAND\n\nwho nods his head.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tVery close, Jeff.\n\nHand reaches over and gets his case.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND (CONT'D)\n\tI think I've made my point with you\n\ttonight.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tHey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a\n\tquestion?\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tDo you have a guy like me every\n\tyear? A guy to... I don't know,\n\tmake a show of. Teach other kids\n\tlessons and stuff?\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tWell, you'll find out next year.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\t\t(smiling)\n\tNo way, mon. When I graduate U.S.\n\thistory I ain't even coming over to\n\tyour side of the building.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tIf you graduate.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\t\t(panicked)\n\tYou're gonna flunk me?!\n\nMr. Hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the\nnearest approximation of a grin we have seen all\nyear. It isn't much, but it's noticeable. His lips\ncrinkle at the ends.\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tDon't worry, Spicoli. You'll\n\tprobably squeak by.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI \n\tAll right! Oh, yeah!\n\nMr. Hand has now gathered all his material, and he\nstands to approach Spicoli's door. Jeff jumps up,\nextends his hand.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tAloha, Mr. Hand!\n\n\t\t\tMR. HAND \n\tAloha, Spicoli.\n\nMr. Hand exits the room, and descends the staircase\nof the Spicoli household. Spicoli kicks the door\nshut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie.\n\nINT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\n\nTight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead\nsinger in a cheesy high school band called the T\nBirds. He is bathed in a blue light, singing the\nlast verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'.\n\nWe pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner\nreading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the\ngym for this event. Many have brought their annual\nyearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his\nfingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart\nof the City'. Some students start to dance.\n\nEvery one of our characters is either here, or\nabout to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli\nto Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying\ntogether. But, just as in the beginning of the year\non lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off\ninto their distinctive cliques.\n\nANGLE ON MORE STUDENTS ARRIVING\n\nat the Last Dance. They see Mr. Hand signing\nannuals by the door. They all say the same thing as\nthey pass, \"Aloha, Mr. Hand\". He nods in return.\n\nANGLE ON STACY\n\nsurveying the growing mob of annual-crazed\nstudents. From behind her comes Linda Barrett in a\nlow-cut black dress.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tWhere's Doug?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tHe's not coming.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY\n\tNot coming?

It's his\n\tloss.\n\nANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE\n\nin another part of the dance, by the Junior class\nsponsored food counter. Damone is standing, talking\nto several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr.\nAttitude.\n\n\t\t\tDAMONE\n\tSign my annual, honey. \n\nThe girls look at each other, laugh.

Sign my annual.\n\nSpicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The\nstoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and\nlingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual.\nThey are all drug-related messages from fellow\nstoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs:\n\"Thanks for the reds. Todd.\"\n\n\t\t\tTODD\n\tHey, mon, good thing we're going to\n\tMexico this summer. 'Cause you're\n\tgonna get kicked out of your house\n\twhen your parents read your annual.\n\nINT. GYMNASIUM - ANGLE ON DOOR\n\nBrad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his\nentrance into the Last Dance. There is a lot of\nactivity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad\nas he walks into the dance. Fifteen kids\nimmediately gravitate towards him. They all want\nBrad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11\nincident. Onstage, the T-Birds play the Beatles'\n\"It Won't Be Long\".\n\nWe see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him.\nHer new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm\naround her.\n\n\t\t\tLISA \n\tI saw your picture in the paper.\n\tYou had the greatest look on your\n\tface!\n\n\t\t\tANOTHER STUDENT \n\tFront of the Metro Section.

He signs, and gives her his. We\nthen see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come\nup, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad\nstudies them warily.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #1 \n\tFuckin' manager of 7-11!\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY #2 \n\tGet us jobs over there, Brad!

He grins and notices\nsomeone across the crowded dance floor.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tHey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!\n\nThey laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his\nelement at last. He moves into the main dancing\narea, works his way across the room, past the\nbleachers, when he hears a voice.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (O.S.) \n\tHamilton!\n\nBrad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the\nbottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back\nwith true respect.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tAwesome.\n\nHe throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They\nsign.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI (CONT'D)\n\tEasy, mon.\n\n\t\t\tBRAD \n\tLater.\n\nANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS\n\nwhere several couples are passionately making out.\nFour teachers clomp up into the stands from\ndifferent angles. They pin the couples in\nflashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an\nescaping prisoner.\n\nANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS\n\nonstage, singing the Rolling Stones' \"I'm Free\".\n\nEXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT\n\nWe see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come\nbacking down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist\nis in the air.\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tSummer, mon!

They are all\nstanding on the steps, waiting.\n\n\t\t\tSURF NAZI\n\tAre you Jeff Spicoli?\n\nSpicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On\nthe end, he sees L.C.\n\n\t\t\tL.C.\n\tThat's him! He did it!\n\n\t\t\tSPICOLI\n\tHey, mon, I don't know what your\n\ttrip is, but...\n\nSpicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the\nSurf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him\nthrough the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and\ninto the night.

He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to\nthe outdoor front tables, and almost look his way.\nThe Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her\ncalling out after him.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY \n\tHey Mark!

He waves across the mall to her.\n\n\t\t\tSTACY (CONT'D)\n\tCome over here!\n\nHe looks back at his post at the theatre, decides\nit's okay to step away. He walks across the mall.\n\nINT.
