Rabbit's home.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rolling out of its bank, the bomber begins a steep climb revealing the fact that it is carrying a small delta winged shuttle on it back.

Understand we are go for crossbow.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly a rocket engine on the back of the modified bomber fires thrusting the plane into steep climb.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. B-1 FLIGHT DECK-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE PLANE VIBRATES. The pilot and co-pilot are busy in their seats. Behind them sits a third pilot wearing a space suit.

A CROWD-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A blond haired, blue-eyed man with a small walkie-talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering Central American peasants and townsfolk. He is disguised as one of them.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON VILLA BALCONY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The uniformed President of this formerly sleepy, now strategically critical nation is waving to his people. He is flanked by military guards. He turns and walks into the villa.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. B-1 BOMBER-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The bomber approaches the top of it's arc.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat, straps in and checks his instruments.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SHUTTLE PILOT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">All systems check.

BOMBER FLIGHT DECK\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The pilot pushes his yolk forward.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. BOMBER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As the bomber falls way, the shuttle's booster ignites with a roar, thrusting it toward space.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. SPACE-LOOKING BACK\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see a tiny glowing speck coming towards us. very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it is the shuttle. Suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE FROM BEHIND\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We follow the shuttle. The engine stops. There is a small explosion, which pushes the booster rocket away. Small maneuvering rockets fire and the shuttle establishes itself in a nose down altitude.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SHUTTLE PILOT (V.O. FILTERED)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Crossbow is established.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BOMBER PILOT (V.O./FILTERED)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Roger, we have ground confirmation. Reference grid seven.

Moving Target Indicator, engage.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Behind and above the cockpit a large hatch opens and a large circular spinning mirror rises and locks into position.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The pilot reaches above him and pulls down a viewfinder and begins looking through it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. THE SHUTTLE.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A target sighting lens moves from right to left, stops, and then moves back but this time with the mirror moving in unison.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. THE SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">While still looking through the viewfinder, the pilot manipulates the targeting controls.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">INSERT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">PILOT'S POV OF THE SCREEN\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Crosshairs, a grid patter and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the Earth's topography as the pilot searches for his target. Then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people. One of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. VILLA PATIO-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The president and his aide are chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries. There is a jovial atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter. The president is proudly displaying one of his medals to his guests. it has a very unique jewel-like object in its middle.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. THE SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The pilot is watching through the viewfinder.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PILOT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(into mike)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Scanner on. Target locked. Tracking locked.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. THE SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The mirror and sighting lens adjust as they track the target.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. VILLA PATIO\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The President is served a cup of coffee. He asks the waiter for sugar. The waiter turns back to his cart.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. THE SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The pilot puts his hands on the joysticks and flips open the trigger covers.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PILOT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nice and easy does it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. THE SHUTTLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Dead silence, then the mirror erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the Earth. Behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes into space.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. VILLA PATIO\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The beam strikes the president like the finger of god. He vaporizes. The waiter turns back with the asked-for sugar to find a smoking hole where the President once stood.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. SPACE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The shuttle finishes its work and the beam shuts down. The mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the screen preparing for re-entry, firing small retro rockets.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PILOT (V.O)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm coming home. Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. A HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM-NO WINDOWS \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A large screen at one end of the room continues to show the re-entry.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The Crossbow Project. There's no defense like a good offense.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In the middle of the room is a giant donut of a round conference table. Another circle hangs above and casts light downward in such a way as to light the table-top but caser those sitting around it in shadow. We can see them but not well. There are SIX MEN in suits. The look is sinister as Hell; but the talk is for Rotary Club meeting.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A MAN, sitting at three o'clock, wearing an Air force major's uniform, points at a remote control device at the screen and stops the film. The lighting does not change. he turns to the man sitting at twelve o'clock.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nice little weapon isn't it, Dave?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I guess so, but gosh, Don, it's a movie. You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Polite laughter all around.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, sometimes I think I might as well.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to one of the others)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you think of what you saw, Roy?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I think there weren't enough girls.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">More polite laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is this thing for biological targets only?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's the kill potential?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">When that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Carmichael shrugs the sign for \"who knows?\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Seriously, Don, I have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule. We have plans for your little ray's gun this summer.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(Trying to cover)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">As I understand it, guys, there's some major practical difficulties. I'm pushing as hard as I can.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you've got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or I'm pulling the plug on the funding.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(very nervous)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm assured they're on the verge of a major breakthrough.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good. Just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by June. Right, general?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I wouldn't know, Dave. I haven't had a working weapon since Korea.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DECKER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Right.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to assistant)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Larry, let's see the film on blinding techniques, then we'll have some lunch, all right?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. EXHIBITION HALL -DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE OPEN on a sign: \"Effects of marijuana on Rodents.\" A cage is divided in half. One side is marked \"NO Marijuana.\" A chinchilla is running furiously on a treadmill. The other side is marked \"Marijuana.\" A chinchilla is lying in a little hammock.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">DOLLY BACK TO WIDE SHOT. We see we are in a large hall. There are dozens of booths and exhibits. A banner strung across the hall lets us know that this is the \"WESTERN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WINTER SCIENCE FAIR.\"\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON a pretty female student at a booth standing in front of a clear glass cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected to it. There are two colored gases inside the cylinder. A sign behind her says: HOW TORNADOS ARE FORMED.\" A small group of boys stand watching her in as sexist a way as possible.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIRL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It doesn't seem to be working; but if it was, these gases would be going around.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">A BOY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We don't care.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON another part of the hall. Two blond-haired, male twins stand proudly in their booth. \"THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF HEAVENLY BODIES.\"  A large, crudely painted diorama of the Milky Way is in the background. Several painted balls are suspended in front, labeled \"Mercury,\" \"Venus,\" etc. The sun is represented by a large electromagnet. All the \"planets\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON a booth near the entrance. A ROBOT attracts a crowd. It has a video screen for a face which reads: \"Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age.\"  With jerky motions he extends his mechanical arms and shakes hands with passersby. He is speaking to a small KID.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HARRY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age...midget mutant; weight... \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The kid shoots it in the neck with a toy space gun. The ROBOT SHORT CIRCUITS: sparks shoot out, its arms fly in circles until a FUSE BLOWS and it SIZZLES to a burning stop.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE PAN OVER TO the door just in time to see the entrance of DR. JERRY ATHERTON, professor of physics at Pacific Tech, and a popular host of a PBS television show about science. His manner and bearing mark him as a classic anal retentive. He is a perfect cross between Carl Sagan and Jerry Brown. Brilliant, intense, seemingly sincere but, in fact, incredibly manipulative. There is an intentional aura of superiority surrounding him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We FOLLOW him in and down an aisle where he draws the attention of the crowd in the manner of the celebrity he is. An OLD LADY stops him. He beams a smile at her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you Dr. Atherton?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, dear.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I just love your television show.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, thank you. We try.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's Albert Einstein really like?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dead.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, I thought you had him on.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, that was just an actor.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is everyone an actor, then?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beginning to tire of this)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, I'm a physicist.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But Einstein isn't?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(dismissing her)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nice talking to you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He walks away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON a booth where we meet MITCH SIMON, aged fifteen. Mitch is a genius. He's known that since he was old enough to understand the word, which was on his first birthday. He was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade. Although he's intellectually precocious, he's still only 15 years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent. His shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He stands with his PARENTS near a demonstration table. Unlike some of the other exhibits we've seen, there is nothing amateurish about this one. In fact, it is an impressive display of a dye laser. We can see the beams of multi-colored rays bouncing between mirrors, moving through liquids, combining with gases.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">MITCH is trying to explain his work to MR. SIMON, who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">See, Dad, it's coherent light.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It talks?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ATHERTON APPROACHES. He is seen by MRS. SIMON, who greets him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, no. I just thought I'd stop by, bring you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee. We did it. Mitch is in.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Isn't that wonderful.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello, Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(shyly)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nice little display?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's your medium?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Just Argon. But I have it all structured for HF if I could get some.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That would be interesting.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's all theoretical at this stage, but I have the power supply completely worked out.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Very nice.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(a kid again)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ATHERTON turns to Mitch's parents.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You must be very proud. he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I image he's the youngest, too.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, actually. The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(almost in tears)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Fifteen year old and off to college. Image.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hoping this is not going to be a problem)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, no...but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don't you agree?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, I guess. It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(polite for Mitch's sake)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I guess we scientists are a little different than athletes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Cheaper.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Smarter\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not when it comes to getting cars.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We just want the best for Mitchie.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(changing gears)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and I have a question for you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, yes?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is that your real hair?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I wondered that, too.\n\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(struggling for manners)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is \"real\" or actually just an \"image\" being broadcast.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Didn't look real. Anyway, listen, I got to get something to eat or I'm gonna die.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on, let's look for something.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They start away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS.

We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you'll BE amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I've put you on my personal research team.

Passing through this Disneyland of Science is a well-dressed executive. ROBERT JENSEN, who is guiding Chris on the tour. Chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter Pacific Tech.  He proved to be even smarter than many of his professors. He also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter Pacific Tech. his antics are legend. Unimpressed with authority, pomposity and bullshit in general., Chris dresses on the sloppy side of life.

This is the Sunday before the beginning of the Winter Term.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We pick up MITCH SIMON and FOLLOW him as he crosses campus. He is wearing a tie and jacket, which only adds to his general sense of being out of place. He is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again. He stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

THE PATIO AND GROUNDS OF THE HOUSE-CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The returning freshman class has gathered for a social. Mitch is the only one in a tie. He stands on the patio with Mrs. Meredith whose husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator, is about to speak to the assembled.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">People, if I might get your attention.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The din begins to quiet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all put the Christmas break to good use?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is good-natured jeering.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering.  This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is some applause and good-natured banter. Mitch is truly moved. This environment is exactly what Mitch has hoped for all his life.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There are cheers and applause.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I say this to every freshman class. Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Almost jubilant cheering and clapping.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith continues in his cherry manner.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We want only the best. Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or M.I.T. might take you, but you don't fit in here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic. Welcome back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse. Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MRS. MEREDITH \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Gene, this is Mitch Simon.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, sir.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And I understand you're already on his project.

This one also turns the map right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of. As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers, DR. BRADFORD. The students have decorated him with a muffler, earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. APPLIED PHYSICS BUILDING-MOMENTS LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch walks down a long corridor. He passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch stops in front of a closed door. He checks the number, then looks down at a card in his hand. He turns the card right-side up. He OPENS the door to REVEAL a darkened lab. In the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams. A voice calls out from the darkness.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.C.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.C.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come in here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Kent is an elitist, intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as Atherton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. I'm Mitch Simon. I'm a student. Dr. Atherton told me to come up here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, you're the new stud, are you.

I wanted that job.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Why?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why. Plus travel, car, stock options...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh. Well, I'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date. Check it over.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Check it over.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">For what?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mistakes, I guess.

Evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what Christ died for.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let's get something very clear here. Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here. Which means when jerry's not here, you do what I say. From God to Jerry to me, get it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Atherton ENTERS.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi Jerry.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did I?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good to see you, Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to the group)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm sure you're all going to become fast friends.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We're well on our way already.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He'll be in charge of the group.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What? I mean, good choice, Jerry.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're doing it again, Kent.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Am I?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where's Chris?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He didn't bother to come in today.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BODIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He said he didn't feel like it; and then I said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what?'; and then I said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so I said 'okay, but I'm telling.'\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank you Bodie. I notice you've stopped stuttering.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BODIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, I've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm sorry he isn't here. I wanted you to meet your hero.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hero? That clown? Look at this.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units. The others gather around it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARTER (Cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We heard he wasn't coming in. Kent and I figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him. And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Another costly mistake.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you sure?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Positive.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Positive.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(reading from notes)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Negative.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(innocently, to Carter and Kent)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There's a mistake all right, but I think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARTER\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(grabbing the notes)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't make mistakes...\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(reading)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">...Usually.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Damnit, don't touch other people's things.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(adjusting the equipment)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This shouldn't take too long to fix.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm glad that you were here, Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't bother with that now. I'm sure you want to go get settled.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(relieved)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, it has been kind of a long day.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Atherton starts to leave.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Anything, Jerry.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Stop it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started  checking everything tomorrow.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">My pleasure.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it.\n\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shall we?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sure.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Atherton exits, followed by Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BODIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. DORM HALL- LATE AFTERNOON\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. ROOM\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The room is small, cramped, and more than a little disheveled. PEI, NASA and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds. Junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere. In one corner is a fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch crosses to his bed and sits. He is exhausted and depressed. The door opens and Mitch see a strange, tall, bulkily- built, hermit-looking kind of a guy enter. He is carrying a McDonald's bag. He stops when he see Mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second, then crosses to the closet, opens the door and exits into it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Getting no response, Mitch rises, goes to the closet, opens it and looks in.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is no one there.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What kind of place is this?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch crosses to his luggage. he opens a bag and, to his surprise, he finds it empty. he then looks in the other bag and find they've all been cleaned out. Puzzled, he shuts the bags.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly, the door swings open and CHRIS KINSLEY , who we saw earlier at PEI, ENTERS. He's dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment. it is, in fact, a baseball pitching machine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch stares.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What is this thing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's a penis stretcher. You want to try it out?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A baseball pitching machine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris is setting it up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I was here for a second this morning...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(frightened)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You didn't straighten the place up, did you?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looks around at the mess)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good. 'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A ball is pitched. Chris connects and the ball smashes through the window.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I put your stuff away for you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Another pitch. He smashes a ball into a wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one's for you, little Johnny.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He whacks another pitch. He does a crowd cheer and circles the bases.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What a game. I'm Chris Kinsley.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, no.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. MOVING CAR- SAME TIME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Dr. Atherton is riding in a rental car with DON CARMICHAEL, a government contract monitor. These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We're falling way behind, Jer.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's a good one. I'll have to remember to use that, Jer.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The new boy is quick.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You can't dictate innovation.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me put this another way, Jer. You  know all that money we've been spending for development?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I see.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The car pulls up to Atherton's house, where there is a great deal of construction going on. Once the work is completed, this is going to be beautifully restored, rather large Victorian home.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looking out)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Having a little work done on the old place, are you? Looks nice.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. MITCH'S ROOM-THAT NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch is gathering up some books. He looks at a chart on the wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Library... library...205.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The door to the room opens while Mitch is looking the other way. We catch a glimpse of the same tall, bulkily-built man opening Mitch's closet door and disappearing inside. Mitch turns just in time to see the door close. he goes into it, opens it and looks inside. Nothing. he goes to the door of his room. Mitch opens the door, steps into the hall and slips, landing on his ass. His books go flying.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HALLWAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The hall floor is covered with ice wall-to-wall. Skating MUSIC is playing on a cassette somewhere. A few students, dressed for winter, are skating. Chris skates over and helps Mitch to his feet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Welcome to Pacific Tech's \"Smart People On Ice.\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He whirls away, leaping from wall to wall, sliding quickly down the ice. He stops in front of a short, roly-poly kid of Japanese descent, MARK ICKAGAMI, better know as ICK. Ick is a bio-chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing memory.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(with a proletariat accent)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ice turned out real good, Ick.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, it worked., didn't it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What did you use?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(teasing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(yelling down the hall)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on, people. Nobody's skating.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">A STUDENT (O.C.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Moles and trolls.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study. I'm hurt. I know that's it's not like me but I'm sorry. I'm starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later. Why do I even bother?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris skates off.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How does he do it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I'm not an expert, but I think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not skating. The horsing around. The never studying. I know he's smart. but nobody's that smart.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know how smart he is. Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How he pulls the grades, I don't know.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Just then, ROARING down the hall, face down on a sled, comes JORDANS COCHRAN. She is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper-kinetic kindergarten class. She crashes at Mitch's feet. He reaches down to help her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You okay?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, not emotionally, no I'm not. I'm disappointed... not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster. It's okay, though, I know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, I'll just have to re-design the blades. I can do that, that's easy. I can do that here; but I have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Maybe another half an hour.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's great, that's good. I can do that, no problem, lots of time.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's your name?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mitch\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks for the help. See you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And in a flash she is gone.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your welcome.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who was that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">That? that was...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jordan rushes back.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm Jordan, I realized I'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you have a bed?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, I was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay. Well, I gotta go, I'll see you later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As she races off, KENT enters carrying several binders.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's all this suppose to be?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This? This is new kind of shovel.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kent can't stand to be laughed at.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(Dumping the binders into Mitch's hands)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This should keep you busy for awhile. This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ha ha.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I suppose you're in on this, too. Did you make this stuff?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not saying.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who's going to clean it up?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't have to. It's going to go from solid form directly to gas.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Really? What is it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're all a bunch of degenerates.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We are? What about that time I caught you naked with a bowl of Jello?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(flustered)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I...you... I was hot and I was hungry. And anyway...Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Number one what?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(pointing to Mitch)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Really? I guess you think you're pretty hot stuff?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(uncomfortable, unsure if this is real)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well...no, I mean\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move. Just as he's about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas. Chris disappears in the cloud.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(excited)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It worked!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's neat.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(teasing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now if we can just keep it from exploding.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kent runs away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(from inside the growing cloud)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, Ick.  Is it okay to breathe this stuff?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ick?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ick?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The cloud fills the screen.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-THE NEXT MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Perfect morning light streams through the window, making even this dump look beautiful. Chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed, proving that even asleep he is eccentric. We Pan across the room to Mitch. He has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that Kent had given him the night before. We HEAR the sound of the door opening, followed by some heavy footsteps. This causes Mitch to wake up. it takes him a second to realize where he is. He sits up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">MITCH'S POV\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door. He is holding a \"McDonald's\" bag. He closes the door behind him.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON MITCH\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">To say the least, he's thrown by this strange intrusion.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He waits a beat, listening. Nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet, looks inside.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">OVER MITCH'S SHOULDER INTO CLOSET\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There's nothing in there but clothes. Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON MITCH\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He shakes his head. This is getting frustrating.

I hope I got the size right, I'm pretty sure I did, I have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one because I was, you know, up. Peeing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I never sleep. I don't know why. It drove my roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but I don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause I'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and I'm usually up and I wouldn't mind, okay?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks, I will.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you finished yet?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I can't start.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because I'm here?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I think so.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Isn't that weird?

THE LOBBY AREA OF THE DORM- A LITTLE LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area. He is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm. As he crosses past the self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen. Mitch follows him inside.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Something strange happened to me this morning.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Why am I the only person who has that dream?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Before Mitch can ask another question, Chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos-like container. He takes it over to the cutting board, then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers, a pair of tweezers, and a little box that looks like a dental floss kit. He opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Liquid nitrogen?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container. he puts it down on the board and, using the tweezers, pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube. Then, from the dental floss kit, he pulls out a length of very fine wire, which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin \"coins\" and slides then into the lid of the container, which he picks up and takes out the door with him. Mitch follows.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VENDING MACHINE AREA\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Coffee?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Using the tweezers, Chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines. There is a high-pitched squeak. To Mitch's astonishment, the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So, what's happened?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh. There's a guy living in our closet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You've seen him too?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junky's treasure trove of goodies.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who is it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hopsfield.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is he... safe?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So far.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris exits.

CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">it is late but Mitch is still hard at the books. Hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet. Mitch doesn't even notice anymore.

LECTURE HALL-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch, dressed more informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54. This time, however, there are several empty seats.

ATHERTON'S LAB-LATE NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch is working alone. He adjusts the laser and turns it on. It burns through a very thick block of wood, but Mitch is still not pleased.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HALLWAY-NEXT MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A very tired Mitch heads for the lecture hall.

CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-ANOTHER NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In need of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He examines the walls and the floor and looks, for hidden switches or secret mechanisms, all to no avail. As he's about to give up, the closet door swings closed. When it closes, the wall opens to reveal a small elevator-like cage. Mitch steps in and the cage descends. It hits a lever and stops. But before Mitch steps in and the can get off, it begins to move sideways, triggering another pulley, and goes down again into the steam tunnels, then drags along the floor and stops. Mitch gets out. It's spooky. In the distance there is a glow of light.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch goes forward until he can see the home of Hopsfield. It's a very utilitarian example of life on the edge, with all the comforts. At the console of an amazing, hand-built computer sits amazing Hopsfield. Mitch watches in awe from the darkness.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is an experiment in progress. A large laser is building up an energy load. Atherton, Kent, Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment. Things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen. Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled. Suddenly, a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost over everything. Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARTER\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(checking the valve)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's nothing. It's just mechanical.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">GOOD. Don't bother changing it. I want you and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size. Should hold up, right Mitch?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sure, as long as we go with H.F.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, gentlemen, now what?

He's working his guts out for you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him.

Mitch is annoyed.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up.

He then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror. Mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">All set, I think.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch throws a switch.

What's a whiss?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme...when I was three years old, I balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell the bell curve. Sound familiar?

Went to work for some chemical company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science was the answer for everything.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">Mitch\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Am I gonna wind up in a steam tunnel?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking.

When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you?

ANTHERTON'S LAB-DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chris enters and prepares to test the new equipment. He aligns the secondary laser and let it charge up. He makes some final checks and then throws a switch. The laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy. The new laser overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes. Chris tries to shut it down but to now avail. he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring, but he's too late. We see everything melting away as the machine eats itself. We also see a message left for Chris just before it too melts. It reads: \"1 laser=1car.\" Chris is on the verge of a complete mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(in anguish)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No!!!!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is nothing but the echo of his voice in response. The main laser stands like a huge, frozen bird in the empty room. In anger and frustration he swears at the machine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You bastard. This is your  fault.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of getting rid of some of this anger; but, instead, all he gets is the basket bouncing back and hitting him in the shin.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shit! I deserve that.

But never mind that now. It came to me. The power problem. I solved it. Echoes! It's so simple, four little mirrors. It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself. I've got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten-fold at least. If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab.

They are engaged in all sorts of silly, mindless activities, ranging from tiddly-winks and video games to watching cartoons. There are supplies of \"brain food\" and health drinks around. Mitch, Ick and Jordan are in the corner. Chris runs up to them.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, Chris. How did it go?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Great. It was a snap.

Are you all right?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank you, Jordan. I do feel terrible but I can't talk about it right now. I need Mitch. Gotta go.

I've already told you you've burned out and you've failed me and yourself miserably.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, I know that. But I thought you might be interested.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not interested in anything you have to say.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Just then a pretty COED starts to come down the stairs.

ATHERTON'S LAB-LATER THAT NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Atherton, Kent, Bodie and Carter stand by the laser as Chris explains what he's done with formulas on the blackboard.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">As you know, I was working on supercharging the DF by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser. Well, when I tried it, I discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone looks at Kent in disgust.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And I want to thank him for the thought.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What????\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough space by themselves, right? Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is a complete waste of time.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration. He is struggling to lift several thick metal plates.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kent does and everyone stands back.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay, Mitch do it. This should work.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch switches on the main laser. It comes to life. Gases flow and a beam appears, hitting the plate without effect.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now we open the vacuum chamber.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He turns a valve and the beam begins to heat up the plate.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So far so good. And now, cross your fingers.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He throws a switch. There's a beat. And then, suddenly, the beam glows intensely brighter, cuts through the plate, the  cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night. Chris and Mitch jump shut the whole thing off.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry about the wall, sir.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looking through the hole)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And the tree across the quad.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(in awe)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Screw the wall, you did it!

You can't. That's my job. I've done everything you've ever asked. I get your laundry, and I finished the mirror. Look.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kent runs out of the room as Mitch and Chris exchange a look and Atherton shakes his head. Kent returns, rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KENT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good, Kent.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Chris, in a hurry)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I have to go.

Where are you going?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SHERRY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've got a little survival place in Wyoming.  We're going to live there.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, it's getting too weird around here.  See ya.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They climb into the Winnebago and it pulls away. The others watch it go.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ICK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You think it's getting too weird around here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Absolutely.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I didn't notice.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I like it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In the background, the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot. The whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As we PULL BACK, Atherton's car pulls up and he gets out, dumbstruck.  Dr. Meredith walks over to him and confronts him. Kent joins Chris and the others who watch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE END.\n\n</p></div>\n\n<b>\n</b><b>\n</b>\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Real Genius</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Neal Israel\" title=\"Scripts by Neal Israel\">Neal Israel</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Pat Proft\" title=\"Scripts by Pat Proft\">Pat Proft</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Peter Torokvel\" title=\"Scripts by Peter Torokvel\">Peter Torokvel</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Real Genius Script.html#comments\" title=\"Real Genius comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:14:11.969647"}
