By first\n          buying controlling interest in his\n          own company at a devalued price,\n          he then brokered a merger with\n          Sirrus that immediately sent\n          Iodyne into the gains record book--\n          the only record book that matters.\n          Look out that window, there isn't\n          a single plane or helicopter or K-\n          Harrier that isn't powered by\n          Iodyne fuel cells.

Burns knew he\n          was going to win. It was already\n          decided. A week before the Prix,\n          Goldman and Sirrus met with\n          several other major players at the\n          Carlyle Hotel. They met there as\n          they had for years, just as their\n          fathers had met, and as their sons\n          and heirs will still meet. They\n          met to negotiate the finish order\n          of the Grand Prix. No race is more\n          important and no race is more\n          controlled. That year Goldman was\n          supposed to win, but he knew if he\n          sold his win to Sirrus, whatever\n          that win might be worth, was\n          nothing compared to what could be\n          gained.\n          He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal.\n\n<b>          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)\n</b>          That's why I paid three million\n          dollars for this burnt and twisted\n          piece of metal.
