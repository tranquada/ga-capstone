Greek. Chinese. Meaningless.\n          He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards\n          the 12. Then back at the test.\n\n          Something suddenly clicks.\n\n           He stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the\n          second hand hits the 12 and he's off-\n          Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could\n          possibly be reading the questions.\n\n          INT.

He flips a few of the\n          pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two\n          cars collide.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          He continues to draw as the background of the classroom\n          fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that\n          he is drawing on.\n          We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars\n          battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed\n          makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound\n          as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one\n          another as --\n          The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash,\n          crossing the finish line still in the air.\n          Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of\n          the roaring crowd.\n          The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees\n          him lost in his fantasy world.\n          A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning\n          to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is\n          no one in the entire school like him.\n          The teacher is about to say something when the bell\n          rings.\n          Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion\n          before anyone else.\n\n          TEACHER\n          Alright, pencils down, bring your\n\n          TESTS--\n          Thwack!

In this\n          world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car\n          collector show; vintage and concept cars are as\n          ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world.\n          Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc\n          around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark\n          fin circling until--\n          The car door pops open and snaps shut.\n          The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a\n          chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window.\n          Speed smiles.\n\n          REX\n          .I take it you're ready to go?\n          Speed nods.

Driving a\n          rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne .\n          Industries, Potts spun out in the\n          second lap and went down as a DNF.\n          A forgettable and pathetic finish.\n          So bad, that afterwards Iodyne\n          stock dropped six points.\n          Again we see the history told in flashback.\n\n          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)\n          Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling\n          cold fresh milk in victory lane, a\n          thousand cameras taking his\n          picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw\n          almost a twelve point gain which\n          immediately block Penninsula Power\n          Cell from being able to afford the\n          price of a complete take-over.\n          This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of\n          Iodyne Inc. in the exact position\n          he wanted to be in. By first\n          buying controlling interest in his\n          own company at a devalued price,\n          he then brokered a merger with\n          Sirrus that immediately sent\n          Iodyne into the gains record book--\n          the only record book that matters.\n          Look out that window, there isn't\n          a single plane or helicopter or K-\n          Harrier that isn't powered by\n          Iodyne fuel cells. That's what\n          racing is about. It has nothing to\n          do with cars, or drivers. All that\n          matters is power and the\n          unassailable might of money.\n          His greed is as tangible as any drug.\n\n          INT.

Burns knew he\n          was going to win. It was already\n          decided. A week before the Prix,\n          Goldman and Sirrus met with\n          several other major players at the\n          Carlyle Hotel. They met there as\n          they had for years, just as their\n          fathers had met, and as their sons\n          and heirs will still meet. They\n          met to negotiate the finish order\n          of the Grand Prix. No race is more\n          important and no race is more\n          controlled. That year Goldman was\n          supposed to win, but he knew if he\n          sold his win to Sirrus, whatever\n          that win might be worth, was\n          nothing compared to what could be\n          gained.\n          He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal.\n\n          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)\n          That's why I paid three million\n          dollars for this burnt and twisted\n          piece of metal.

VICTORY LANE\n\n\n          REPORTER 2\n          Speed, does this mean you've\n          signed with Okamoto?\n\n          SPEED\n          Uh, no. This was... a mutually\n          beneficial opportunity.\n\n          KATSU\n          Yes, well put.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          127.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          REPORTER 3\n          Katsu, does this mean you will be\n          running in the Grand Prix this\n          weekend?\n\n          KATSU\n          We'll see. Right now I'm just\n          going to enjoy this victory.\n\n          INT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE\n\n\n          OKAMOTO\n          The price is 78 a share.\n\n          REMMINGTON\n          That's outrageous! The price is\n          barely above 50! This is\n          extortion! Blackmail! I'll sue\n          you! Tie up every asset you own\n          up for the next 20 years!\n\n          OKAMOTO\n          As you wish Mr. Remmington. Have\n          a nice day.\n\n          REMMINGTON\n          Wait!\n          He grinds his molars until they are smooth.\n\n          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)\n          Seventy-eight a share. I'll have\n          the papers drawn up.\n\n          OKAMOTO\n          A pleasure doing business with\n          you.\n\n          INT. OKAMOTO'S OFFICE\n\n          sit across\n          Okamoto hangs up the phone. Katsu and Horuko\n          from him. He smiles.\n\n          OKAMOTO\n          You have done very well for us, my\n          son.\n          Katsu smiles the same smile as his father. The only\n          person not smiling in the room is Horuko.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          128.\n\n          INT. RACER FAMILY GARAGE\n\n          Speed kicks over a tool box giving voice to his rage with\n          a cacophony of clattering metal.\n          He jumps into the Mach 5. The engine guns the wheels\n          screech as he peels out and away leaving--\n          Inspector Detector standing with this hat in hand, his\n          frown mirrored by Pops.\n\n          SPARKY\n          I don't get it. What just\n          happened?\n\n          POPS.\n          Okamoto played us for chumps. All\n          he wanted was our help to drive up\n          the stock on his family's company.\n          Even if there was a file, he had\n          no intention of turning it over.\n\n          SPARKY\n          You mean that whole race was for\n          nothing?\n\n          INT. MACH 5\n\n          Speed screams as loud as he can strangling the steering\n          wheel as he rockets through a series of familiar with\n          curves.\n\n          EXT. THUNDERHEAD\n\n          Without the lights or banners or crowds, the race track\n          echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral. It\n          is here that Speed has always found himself.\n          But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless\n          abandon, it becomes clear that he is chasing something\n          that he has lost.\n          He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger,\n          wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life.\n          Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his\n          prayer, a miracle--\n          His brother.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          129.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          For a moment he believes that he is again driving beside\n          the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up\n          against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost--\n          It's Racer X.\n          The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his\n          anger and Speed swings his car, wielding it like a club,\n          trying to clobber him.\n          Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have\n          at one another, banging, shoving one another into the wall--\n          Until Speed can't take it anymore and he goes at X as\n          ferociously as he can, throwing him into a tailspin--\n          Crashing him into one of the grand stands.\n          Silence embraces the track.\n          Speed climbs out of the Mach 5.\n\n          SPEED\n          X? Racer X?\n          There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as\n          though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too\n          far.\n\n          SPEED (CONT'D)\n          Racer X?!!\n          He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes\n          the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He\n          practically falls out of his car.\n\n          RACER X\n          Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I\n          haven't been thrown like that in\n          years.\n\n          SPEED\n          What are you doing here?\n\n          RACER X\n          The inspector told me what\n          happened., I came looking for you.\n\n          SPEED\n          Why?\n\n          RACER X\n          Thought you'd take it hard and\n          maybe do something stupid.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          130.\n\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n\n          SPEED\n          Why would you care?\n\n          RACER X\n          Because you're a fighter. And a\n          friend.\n\n          SPEED\n          Why don't you just tell me the\n          truth?\n          Racer X stares at him hard.\n\n          SPEED (CONT'D)\n          You're Rex, aren't you?\n\n          RACER X\n          You mean your brother?\n\n          SPEED\n          Youfirstappeared two years after\n          Rexdied.You drive just like\n          him.Youknew I'd be here because\n          thisis where he always used to\n          takeme.Just tell me the truth.\n          mask.\n          After a long hard moment, Racer X pulls off his\n          He is not Rex. Speed is stunned.\n\n          SPEED (CONT'D)\n          You're... not Rex.\n\n          RACER X\n          No. I'm sorry Speed but your\n          brother is dead.\n          He pulls his mask back on.\n\n          SPEED\n          I'm sorry.\n\n          RACER X\n          Don't be. I'm sure where ever\n          your brother is, he is immensely\n          proud of you.\n\n          SPEED\n          For what? Making the same\n          mistakes he did?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          131.\n\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n\n          RACER X\n          For trying to make a difference.\n          From what I've read, that's all he\n          tried to do.\n\n          SPEED\n          And what good did it do? He got\n          killed for nothing. Racing hasn't\n          changed and it never will!\n\n          RACER X\n          It doesn't matter if racing never\n          changes. What matters is if we\n          let racing change us. Everyone of\n          us has to find the reason to do\n          this. You don't climb into a T-\n          180 to be a driver. You do it\n          because you're driven.\n\n          SPEED\n          I don't know why I'm doing it\n          anymore.\n\n          RACER X\n          That's obvious. At Fuji, you were\n          trying to prove something. At\n          Cristo, you were looking for\n          justice. Neither are the reason\n          you belong behind a steering\n          wheel.\n\n          SPEED\n          If you know so much, why don't you\n          tell me why I should keep driving?\n\n          RACER X\n          Sorry. That's for you to figure\n          out.\n          He climbs back into his car.\n\n          RACER X (CONT'D)\n          I just hope when you do, I'm there.\n          to see it.\n          He roars away leaving Speed alone.\n\n          INT. SPEED'S ROOM\n\n          Speed is furiously packing. There is a knock on the door\n          but he ignores it.\n          Sprittle opens the door, Chim-chim following him in.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          132.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Hey watcha doin?\n\n          SPEED\n          What's it look like?\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Where ya goin?\n\n          SPEED\n          I don't know. I just gotta get\n          away from here.\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Why?\n\n          SPEED\n          Because.\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Because why?\n\n          SPEED\n          Because I have to.\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Can we come with you?\n          Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu.\n\n          SPEED\n          What?\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Can we come with you?\n\n          SPEED\n          No.\n\n          SPRITTLE\n          Why?\n\n          SPEED\n          You'll understand when it's your\n          turn.\n          He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door.\n\n          INT. RACER FAMILY LIVING ROOM\n\n          there,\n          Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already\n          sitting, waiting, a heaviness in his.limbs.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          133.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          POPS\n          Speed, before you go, I'd like to\n          say a few things. Will you sit\n          with your old man for a minute?\n          Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag.\n\n          SPEED\n          Don't try to stop me.\n\n          POPS\n          I won't. I made a mistake trying\n          to tell you what to do at Cortega.\n          You were right. I was wrong. I\n          won't make that mistake again.\n          Speed sits.\n\n          POPS (CONT'D)\n          I want you to know that I acted\n          rashly. I said things I wish I\n          hadn't. Your mother usually\n          protects me from making an ass out\n          of my self but I was determined to\n          do it this time and I guess I did\n          a pretty good job of it. I wanted\n          to make sure you understood how\n          sorry I was.\n\n          SPEED\n          Thanks.\n\n          POPS\n          The truth was, I couldn't have\n          been more proud of you son. Not\n          because you won, but because you\n          stood up, you weren't afraid and\n          you did what you thought was\n          right.\n\n          SPEED\n          So? It didn't amount to anything.\n          It was completely meaningless.\n\n          POPS\n          How could it be meaningless? I\n          saw my son become a man. I\n          watched him act with courage and\n          integrity and drive the pants off\n          of every driver on the road. This\n          is not meaningless. This is the\n          reason for a father's life.\n          Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          134.\n\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n\n          POPS (CONT'D)\n          I admit I went to Cortega because\n          I was afraid that what happened to\n          Rex was going to happen to you.\n          And I just couldn't take that. I\n          couldn't loose another one of my\n          boys like that again. But what I\n          realize in Cortega was that I\n          didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I\n          lost him here. I lost him when he\n          walked out of this house and I let\n          him go without telling him how\n          proud I was of him and how much I\n          loved him. I let him think that a\n          stupid motor company meant more to\n          me than he did. You'll never know\n          how much I regret that mistake,\n          but it's enough that I'll never\n          make it again.\n          He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him.\n\n          POPS (CONT'D)\n          I love you Speed. I understand that\n          every child leaves home but I want\n          you to know that door is always\n          open and you can always come back.\n\n          SPEED\n          I love you Pops. I'm just so\n          confused right now. I don't what\n          I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm\n          locked up in some kinda tailspin\n          and no direction makes sense.\n\n          POPS\n          I know what that's like. When Rex\n          died I didn't even. know if I\n          wanted salt on my eggs, let alone\n          if I wanted to keep building cars.\n          Then, do you remember when we sat\n          here, that night, watching old Ben\n          Burns and Dugazi? You remember\n          that?\n          Speednods vaguely.\n\n          POPS (CONT'D)\n          Sittin' here, cheering with you,\n          something just clicked, like a\n          light being switched on inside of\n          me and after that, I never had\n          trouble remembering how I liked me\n          eggs.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          135.\n\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n\n          SPEED\n          Jeez Pops. That's just it.\n          That's part of my problem.\n\n          POPS\n          What?\n\n          SPEED\n          That race. The '43 Prix. Burns\n          and Dugazi? It was fixed.\n          Remmington told me the whole\n          story. It was all about some DNF\n          names Rotts. They've known the\n          winner of every Grand Prix for the\n          past 50 years. It's always fixed.\n          That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow.\n\n          POPS\n          I don't believe that.\n          Remmington's a crook. You can't\n          believe a crook.\n\n          SPEED\n          I don't think he was lying, Pops.\n\n          POPS\n          The Grand Prix? A sham?\n          Ding dong.\n\n          POPS (CONT'D)\n          Who could that be?\n\n           WITH\n          Speed opens the door. She seems to glow, radiating\n          her own incandescence.\n\n          SPEED\n          Horuko?!\n\n          HORUKO\n          Forgive me for intruding but I had\n          to come before it was too late.\n          Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another\n          set-up.\n\n          HORUKO (CONT'D)\n          This is not a trick. I swear to\n          you. I am not my brother.\n\n          POPS\n          You going to ask the lovely lady\n          in?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          136.\n\n          CONTINUED: (4)\n\n          SPEED\n          Yeah, sure.
