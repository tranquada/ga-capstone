There's a long silence.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AARON (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          He had his... shortcomings, but he\r\n          took care of his family. He loved his\r\n          family. He loved this house. He\r\n          worked hard. All I wanted today was\r\n          to show him how much we all loved and\r\n          admired him. To give him the respect\r\n          that he deserved... Is that really so\r\n          much to ask? We all get so distracted\r\n          by the... little things in life. We\r\n          forget about the important things.\r\n          Like the fact that we lost a great\r\n          man.\r\n          The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AARON (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          So maybe he loved \"Dreamgirls\" more\r\n          than most men. We don't know why a\r\n          man makes the choices he makes. But I\r\n          do know that my father made the best\r\n          choices he could make. Life is\r\n          complicated. We're just thrown here\r\n          together in a world filled with chaos\r\n          and confusion... and we do our best.\r\n          And Dad did his best...\r\n          Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of\r\n          Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by\r\n          Aaron's words.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AARON (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          He taught us to go for what we wanted\r\n          in life, because you never know how\r\n          long you're going to be here... And\r\n          whether you succeed... or you fail...\r\n          the important thing is that you tried.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n<b>          117.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         CONTINUED: (5)\r\n</b>          A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see\r\n          the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AARON (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          So when you all leave here today, I\r\n          want you to remember Dad for who he\r\n          really was... A decent, loving man\r\n          who never condemned anyone for how\r\n          they lived. Who never cast\r\n          disparaging remarks or held prejudices\r\n          against race, gender... height. If\r\n          only we could all be as giving, as\r\n          generous, as understanding as my\r\n          father... Even dead, my father has\r\n          more character than everyone in this\r\n          room. If I am half the man my father\r\n          was, my child will be incredibly\r\n          blessed.\r\n          Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go.\r\n          Michelle follows him out of the room.\r\n\r\n<b>                         FADE OUT:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         FADE IN:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT.

He\r\n          walks over and takes a seat.\r\n\r\n<b>                         AARON\r\n</b>          How's Mom?\r\n\r\n<b>                         RYAN\r\n</b>          She's resting.\r\n          A beat.\r\n\r\n<b>                         RYAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          I've asked Mom to come live with me\r\n          for awhile. It'll give you and\r\n          Michelle a chance to breathe a bit,\r\n          you know.
