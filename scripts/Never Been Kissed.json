We hear the chanting of a crowd.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CROWD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie! Josie! Josie!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know in some movies how they have a dream sequence only they don't tell you it's a dream?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Pull out to reveal Josie on pitcher's mound of a--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. A BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's packed. Reporters line the field. All eyes are on Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n<b> (V.O.)\n</b></p><p id=\"dia\">This is so not a dream.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The stadium clock sets at 5:00. The crowd goes crazy. Josie takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, \"Oh God.\"\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. ELECTRONICS STORE -- CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Multiple images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n<b> (V.O.)\n</b></p><p id=\"dia\">It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. BASEBALL STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The clock starts to tick down. The crowd yells again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n<b> (V.O.)\n</b></p><p id=\"dia\">Trust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. CHICAGO SUN TIMES BULLPEN -- DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Packed with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the crowd.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Told you. I'm over there.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The camera swings to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RHODA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Theater--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Standard American calls for \"er\". Standard British is \"re\". So go for \"er\", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her wake.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RHODA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he talks, ignoring Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(into phone)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Josie)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Messages?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Merkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie. Disgusted, she takes it by one corner.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(into phone)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Seriously? No way. No way--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie's still standing there.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Merkin, do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Merkin swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone call.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(back into phone)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay, I'm back, so--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie sighs, walks to her door. It's marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy Editor. She adjusts the plate so it's perfectly straight.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles, satisfied, ready for another day.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita Brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi-unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Guess who I did it with last night...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(duh)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Roger in Op/Ed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who told!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, \"I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him.\"\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie just stares at her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Once it didn't happen for sure.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus Strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy onto Josie's desk.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(emphasizing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It is hoped that it's not a mess. \"Hopefully\" is an adverb. It means \"with hope\". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus and Anita just stare at Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, excuse me for caring about words.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Anita)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, man! Who told?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita flounces off.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How many times have I fired her?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Five-- Six--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(shrugging, giving up)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Eh.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus turns to exit.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(disappointed)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You've done five of my ideas.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A flack jacket.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(not getting it)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A--flack jacket.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey--I can be out of control.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus smiles. On his way out he re-adjusts Josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(over his shoulder)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Copy by five.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUNCHROOM -- DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Actually, a pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch--Anita eats Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Be honest. Do you think I'm aggressive?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita ponders a moment.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You stood for like a month.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cynthia, an affable African-American woman in her 40's, enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Just because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie, you listen to me. If you feel you're a writer--(touching her chest)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Here, deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You write obituaries.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Cynthia, aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I eat 'em one at a time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Josie)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Y'know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Forget it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm concentrating on my career right now.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(embarrassed)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Anita!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy\u0097\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie laughs in spite of herself.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">When I finally get kissed, I'll know.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita and Cynthia trade looks.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">\"That thing\"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita and Cynthia take this in.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Damn, girl. You are a writer.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. TIKI POST -- DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Basically a Mailbox Etc. store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold Fedex envelopes.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with \"Tiki Post\" emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the cash register.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Monty Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The place is empty.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONTY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(of course)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONTY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian music. Monty puts a lei over her head.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONTY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aloha! Welcome!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Monty takes the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through the cash inside.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks, Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked outside.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That is so--weird that you name your car.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No it's not. Guys name their penises.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okaaaay....(then)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">That car's going to bankrupt you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">She just needs a new windshield wiper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob hands the money back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Y'know what? Take it. I don't want it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie hands it back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your \"things that make you a better person than me\" list.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Better person than I.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">See!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(whispering)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This--this is a luau that sells packing material!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Someday this luau is going to be all mine!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She exits. The music starts up again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONTY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come again!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever seen. Lots of books on shelves.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says: \"LOVE\". She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There. What d'you think, guys? Where should it go?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie looks around the living room.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hmm.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(She pretends to listen to the turtles.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's that? Bedroom? Great idea!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She walks into the bedroom with the pillow.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A perfectly arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Perfect.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. A CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">An older man, Dutton, smiles proudly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Dutton's face falls. Everyone looks horrified.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You heard me. Out. Out.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Dutton shuffles out. Josie takes a big bite of donut.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So. Happy March everybody!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(by rote)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Happy March Mr. Rigfort.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">To celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone looks underwhelmed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- \"hair today, gone tomorrow\"? Hat's off to you, Bruns.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We pan over to Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods sadly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Or should I say \"hat's on\"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Howard smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RIGFORT\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family.

TIKI POST BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie has just gotten violently ill. She rises off her knees, grabs some toilet paper to wipe her mouth.

HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage JOSIE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">braces, heavy glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking down the corridor with a huge backpack on her back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk Sprite into her backback.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kids smile and snicker as Josie continues down the hallway.

Josie follow Billy's gaze down to between her feet where a pool of Sprite has gathered. Billy starts to laugh. Kids around him join in. As the laughter echoes around her we DISSOLVE BACK TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. TIKI POST BATHROOM - SAME (PRESENT DAY)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie stares into the mirror.

THE MALL - TEEN CLOTHING STORE - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita and Josie cruise through a teen clothing store, carrying large bags from a stationery store.

How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">SMASH CUT TO: CLOSE UP - AN ALARM CLOCK\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">on a bedside table. Surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair color, a stack of index cards, ripped magazine pages of teen looks, issues of Teen Beat and YM. The clock slips to 7:00. NPR starts playing. A hand reaches over, hits the radio off. SOUND EFFECTS: A school bell. As the bell continues to ring, we widen to:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie sits up in bed, covers pulled up to her chin in terror.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. A CHICAGO STREET - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">MUSIC UP: \"Morning Train\". Crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto the stairs leading up to the El.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A big yellow car jerks into frame, backfires noisily. It's Josie at the wheel of Bambi. She jerks out of frame.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. SOUTH GLEN SOUTH HIGH SCHOOOL - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A suburban campus anchored by a main building. Cars pull into the parking lot for the beginning of the day. Kids greet each other, converge on the front doors of the school. General mayhem.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bambi pulls in. She jerks into a spot, backfiring once more for effect. The entire scene stops. Kids freeze, look at Josie. A beat, and they they continue on their way.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. BAMBI - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie takes a few deep breaths.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay, I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do this.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie steps out of the car wearing the maribou jacket, earrings, and white jeans. She shuts the door behing her, starts walking. She has unknowingly shut her jacket in the door and as she walks, a piece of maribou rips, trailing behind her like a tail.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, okay. Feeling good...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie merges with the throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby. She stares around, overwhelmed. \"Go Rams!\" banners share space with signs that read: \"63 DAYS TIL PROM!\" She inches her way along the wall until she is stopped by a guard who grabs her arm.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey--where are you going?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, I'm a student. Most definitely a student. In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(greeting random kids)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi. Hi there.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them, to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through. Josie smiles, \"whoops,\" walks back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(under his breath)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Freak.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - MINUTES LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie's stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell phone, laptop, mini tape recorder, electronic organizer, pager, being scrutinized by the guard. Josie's sure she's been found out. Camera widens. Down from Josie, we see other kids' belongings spread out. They have the identical high-tech equipment. The guard picks up Josie's nail file, examines it -\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Weapon.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And throws it in the trash.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, totally lost. She approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi--um, I'm looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth - a tongue pierce. Josie does too. We zoom in on that shiny little metal ball. Josie is fixated. So fixated that we stop hearing the boy's voice. All we see is the mouth - and that ball - moving. The mouth closes. He's done. Josie's face is contorted in imagined pain.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ow.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(catching herself)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I mean, wow. Wow. Great directions. Clear.

HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks up to Room 204. Opening the door, she's met by a sea of faces.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ms. Knox, mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the front of the class.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi - hello. Wilkommen. Entre.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks in. Kids whisper and snicker.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry I'm late.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, well, I'm sorry I forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es su casa.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. The class titters. She sits in front of two girls, Kirsten and Kristen, beautiful and intimidating.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That is so sad --\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie, in my classroom, tardiness is unacceptable --\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm really sorry --\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ms. Knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk. The class laughs in recognition.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not as sorry as I am.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ms. Knox puts the sombrero on a less-than-thrilled Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ole! Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard --it's filled with precise script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins --\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">My name is Josie. I'm a high school student. I came from --\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Just then the classroom door opens. We see from Josie's perspective a blinding light, Josie squints. From the light emerges a shadowy vision of Billy Prince.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Billy?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie blinks, REVEAL not Billy, but a beautiful guy, Guy. He stands very close to her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(catching herself)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Bali.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(another beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm from Billy-Bali. It's a suburb of Bali proper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to Ms. Knox, and moves to his seat.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MS. KNOX\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Bali. Fascinating! What did your family do there?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie looks around in panic, sees a student in a South Glen South windbreaker with huge ram on the back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We were--sheep--farmers. We raised sheep. In Billy-Bali.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie realizes the trouble she's gotten herself into.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(caught)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God--do I miss Billy-Bali.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It had--a really great...aquarium.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She sits. Defeated.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie rushes down the hall, still toting her enormous bag. A huge banner - SOUTH GLEN, OUR NATION'S BEST PROM - hangs prominently. She talks covertly into a hand-held tape recorder.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Note to self--Research Bali. Kill Anita for picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. CLASSROOM - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie and her enormous bookbag enter. She takes a seat toward the back of the room.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kristen, Kirsten and GIBBY, another beauty, enter and head to the back of the room.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kirsten and Gibby stand over Josie, staring at her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We sit here.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh. Sorry--I didn't know these were assigned.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY:\n</p><p id=\"dia\">They're not.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward, next to two empty seats. TWO STONERS shuffle over to Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STONER 1\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry. We sit here.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(indicating two empty seats)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Couldn't you two--sit there?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STONER 2\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Right. Except there are three of us--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Stoners eye each other, then the two seats. A look of horror comes over Stoner 1.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STONER 1(cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dude--we left Jed at the 7-11!\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Again!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie picks up her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in the room-in the front row, surrounded by \"Denominators\" who all wear orange Denominator sweatshirts.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sitting next to Josie is ALDYS, a Denominator--intense, wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. She smiles at Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie smiles back and looks up as MR. COULSON enters the room. He's a ruggedly handsome twenty-something Yale grad.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He grabs a notebook out of his bag, goes around to sit on the front of his desk, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, everyone.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(Spots Josie)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don t think we've met.

HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's - finally- the end of the day. Josie makes her way down the hall, clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed and shoved by kids as they storm outside. A huge banner hangs overhead reading: \"SIGN UP FOR SENIOR NIGHT!\"\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we see, as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag, it is completely blank.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR.

Bambi is gone.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks around the lot, getting visibly upset.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In the corner of the lot, we see a group of Denominators removing a BIG METAL CHAIN from around a group of tightly packed cars.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALDYS\n<b> (O.S.)\n</b></p><p id=\"dia\">They do it to all the new kids.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie finds Aldys standing next to her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who's of they?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aldys motions up to a second floor window.

Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J.

Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus slams down his phone.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(into a dead phone)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You didn't taste the pimento loaf.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She looks back to the table where Aldys is dividing the check.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR.

Josie points to the left, Aldys looks, and Josie stuffs a whole brownie in her mouth. They laugh uncontrollably as Josie starts to choke and cough up most of the brownie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We pan down a row of nervous looking Denominator faces as they watch Josie, sitting head to head against a DIGIT, an opposing Math-a-lon competitor. They both work furiously on a problem. A judge sits between them. A makeshift scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her card. He looks it over, and gives her team five points. They win.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Denominators erupt into cheers. They're jumping all over Josie, going crazy. As we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty, except for a handful of Denominators going crazy on one side, and a janitor sweeping up on the other.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. MALL BOOK STORE - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Smiling at each other, Josie and Aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line.

And it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CU on Josie's face. She's clearly uncomfortable.

CLASSROOM - DAY (FLASHEACK)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE BACK to Josie, now seventeen and mortified, nervously standing in class and reading a poem. Billy Prince sits to the side--she glances at him throughout the poem, it's clearly about him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Does he notice me? Does he hear my heart screaming his name-- sometimes it's so loud I think the Gods can hear my pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The CLASS laughs at her except for Billy, who smiles at her, looking slightly touched.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY (FLASHBACK)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Seventeen-year-old Josie is surrounded by an elaborate, color-coded index card system for her research paper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Her friend, SHEILA, over-weight and pimply, comes running across the library at breakneck speed. She sits down next to Josie, visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SHEILA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">O.K., what have you wanted for like ever but you didn't think it would -ever happen?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie looks at her for a moment, mulling it over.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That they'd start an Olympic team for grammar - like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I'm scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I'm so young. But then there's talk of me in the '96 games-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SHEILA.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No-, better. Something better\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie smiles.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm the most popular girl in school, and Billy Prince is taking me to prom.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie laughs at the absurdity.

Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out.

Coming out to sniff some hydrants?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie is frozen, but not Aldys.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALDYS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, Guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that's all the time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Tyke gets it, and laughs.

She reads the headline, looking very surprised.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie, I am appalled.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie picks up the paper, and starts reading intently.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Jeez, so am I. I had no idea that these kids- let's see- turn to A14-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She tries to turn to A14, but Gus grabs the paper out of her hands in a rage.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(trying to keep his cool)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh. Right.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus angrily tries to fold the paper back 'up. He's having a hard time. Josie tries to help, but he yanks it away. Gus reads aloud from the newspaper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call \"The Court.\" Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, \"Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night.\"\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(disbelieving)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Kristen got a quote?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus looks up at Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, urm, she's right.

Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus looks like he may combust. He opens the newspaper, finds what he's looking for, and shoves it in Josie's face. It is a picture of all of the popular kids at Southglen- Kristen, Kirsten, Gibby, Guy- they are all posing for the picture at The Court, smiling and holding beers.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He points to the picture in the paper of the Popular Kids.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you even know these kids?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(trying)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">They hid my car--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus leans in very close.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Get to know them.

No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God! You're at Southglen South?

Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in.

HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NEXT MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie approaches the school.

No one pays much attention to her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">GEORGE, thirty-something African-American, the epitome of cool, waves Josie over to an open van side door.

A realization sweeps over her face.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym clothes. She is clearly beaten.

She's trying her best to keep her game face on. The CARNY opens the gate, the Kids pile onto the ride, two by two. Josie reaches an empty car--the last one--and gets in. The Carny holds the safety bar open.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARNY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where's your partner?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't--I don't have one--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CARNY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(yelling loudly)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN!\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Crowd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">SINGLE!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you have to yell like that?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam, standing by a vendor, looks over and notices Josie's predicament.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TOMMY (O.S.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Of course it's Loser that's holding up the ride!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam walks up to the Josie's bucket.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This seat taken?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(relieved)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He gets in.

Suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out of their reverie.

JOSIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie is getting ready for prom. She wears her bathrobe and is doing her make-up. She looks over at her dresser where she eyes the camera/flight wings pin tentatively.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. DEN - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob, in boxers, a dress shirt, and socks is filling flasks with vodka. Josie comes in the door wearing a lovely Elizabethan gown. She looks absolutely beautiful.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wow, Josie- you look really-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hopeful)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rufus?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes.

Tom Cruise. \"Risky Business\".\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He puts on his black wayfarer sunglasses, and does the famous slide into the living room. Josie laughs.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob smiles and exits.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie nervously checks her reflection in the T.V. - just like she did eight years ago. She takes a deep breath, and goes out.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. FRONT PORCH - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie comes out on the porch, and sees the limo rounding the corner, just like eight years before. The sunroof opens. And Guy stands up - holding something.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie panics - and starts to take cover - but then sees he's holding a dozen white roses. And holding them out to her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on beautiful - what are you waiting for?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie, smiling, runs down the driveway to the limo.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Prom night. And it really is magical. Twinkling lights dot the trees, MUSIC wafts out from the club. A neon sign that says \"Meant For Each Other\" blinks above the building.- COUPLES make their way inside. We see MORK a MINDY, ANTONY a CLEOPATRA and Sera dressed as a RABBIT. Annoyed, she turns back to her lagging date, Brett, dressed as a TORTOISE.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SERA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello! If you don't hurry up we're gonna miss the whole thing!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen exit limos with their DATES. They all wear the same straight blonde wig, and look at each other in horror.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kirsten's wearing a short, tight miniskirt.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And I'm Evening Gown Barbie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Right. That's not an evening gown.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It is on Barbie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie and Guy approach, dressed in Elizabethan costume. They look great.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie, you look Rufus.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who are you guys?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't tell me\u0085you're Medieval Barbie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rosalind and Orlando.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(nothing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">From \"As You Like It\"?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(more blank stares)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shakespeare?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's like talking to a sack of hammers. Guy interjects.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look! I get to have a sword!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And they all ooh and ahh.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB \u0096 CONTINOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE FOLLOW Josie and the group into the prom. The place looks amazing. Lights, ice sculptures, champagne fountains. WE PAN DOWN the buffet.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A BOY dressed as a jar of PEANUT BUTTER and his date, JELLY, are getting food. Peanut Butter turns away from the buffet and bumps into a GIRL dressed as a CHOCOLATE BAR.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PEANUT BUTTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">oh, sorry.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There's a magical beat as they smile at each other.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHOCOLATE BAR\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's okay--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jelly looks on, chagrined.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We reach two OLDER GENTLEMEN in tuxes who carry clipboards and wear big buttons that read: NATIONAL PROM JUDGE. They contemplate the ice sculpture.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JUDGE #1\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's deft and unique without being derivative.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JUDGE #2\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looking off)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey! Pigs in blankets!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he runs off.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie sits with the COOL GROUP at a table. Kristen is making odd faces.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Kristen, what are you doing?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm practicing my surprised face for when we get named to prom court.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">JOSEPH and a very pregnant MARY approach their table and try to sit down.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry. There's no room at this table.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Joseph and Mary amble off. Guy turns to Josie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You having fun?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(meaning it)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Candles are lit. George's Date sits on the couch. The monitor is on showing the JOSIE CAM POV.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He flips the switch, the lights dim and a small disco ball starts moving slowly. George settles in next to his Date.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The entire office is crammed into Gus's office. Anita sits up front, spellbound, watching the JOSIE CAM. Gus stands in back. Okay, he's a little interested too.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is the most beautiful prom I have ever been to.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cynthia runs in with a bowl of popcorn.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CYNTHIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did I miss the crowning?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, but I'm closing the pool in five minutes.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Merkin holds out a bowl of cash.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MERKIN\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie's odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of the night.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE PAN ACROSS the dance floor where we see POPEYE &amp; OLIVE OYL, SONNY &amp; CHER, the BLUES BROTHERS.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE HOLD on ROBIN dancing with BATGIRL. BATMAN approached and taps Robin's shoulder--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BATMAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">May I have this dance-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Batgirl steps aside--Robin and Batman dance happily away.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE ON ROB trying to slow dance with Tracy\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">(dressed like REBECCA De MORNAY), but she is so-drunk she's having trouble balancing.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TRACY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you having fun?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah. Definitely.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He tries to stand her up on her own.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TRACY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good. Gibby gave me champagne.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Maybe we should sit.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He helps her to a chair next to the dance floor. They both sit. Next to them, a ravenous MISS PIGGY eats with her date KERMIT looking on. She picks up an hors d'oeuvre and stares at it horrified.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MISS PIGGY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God! Is this a pig in a blanket?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Tracy looks at Rob, and gets serious.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TRACY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rob, I've - I've thought about it a lot. And I think- I mean, I know. You're the one. My penguin.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob looks at her. She's young. She's beautiful. She's tipsy. She's trying to put her legs behind her head.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wow - I-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TRACY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He looks around. It's high school prom. A skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner. Other kids are sneaking smokes. He can't do this.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ROB\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm gonna get you some water. And then, I think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rob gets up, kisses Tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment table. Tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into Kermit's lap. Kermit looks down, surprised and interested. Miss Piggy notices, gives him a big \"Harumph\", tosses her hair, and leaves.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE BACK ON: THE COOL TABLE.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gibby is staring O.S. in horror.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did I say that out loud?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE FOLLOW Kristen's stare to the prom entrance where Aldys and the Denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. They cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their unwieldy, tied-together conga line. They approach the Cool Table.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So what are you supposed to be? Other than freaks?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALDYS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We're DNA. A double helix. But I guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kristen reaches out and touches the rope binding Denominator #1 to Aldys. Denominator #1 slaps her hand away.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENOMINATOR #1\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Please don't touch the hydrogen. It's rented.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kristen reacts.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ON THE STAGE \u0096 LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam takes the stage, with a card in his hand.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, the moment has arrived.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He looks at the card.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Our 1999 prom court - the princesses are - Miss Kristen Rey, Miss Kirsten Leosis and Miss Gibby Zarefsky. And the princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob -\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam looks at the card, and then looks around. Nobody can help him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mr. Rob ... Mr. Rob!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The crowd cheers. Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen all jump in preplanned delight. Rob seems genuinely surprised. Jason carries Tommy up to the stage piggyback. The girls make their way to the stage, and put on their \"PROM COURT\" sashes. Sam looks to the card again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Next up - Southglen's Prom King\u0085\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy is already halfway to the stage-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Guy Perkins!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The crowd goes wild. Guy reaches the stage and takes his crown and scepter.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And - this year's prom queen -\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam looks at the card, then at Josie. Josie is standing; eyes open, staring at the podium...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Crowd is rapt, waiting for the announcement. Anita has her eyes squeezed shut, praying for the win...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ANGLE ON SAM.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ladies and gentlemen \u0096 Josie Geller!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Crowd CHEERS like crazy, Josie smiles.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR.

Yes!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita gives Gus a big hug. Gus is completely taken aback. Merkin dolefully hands out money.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie is hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, elated, to the stage. Sam places the Queen's tiara on her head and hands her a bouquet of flowers. They lock eyes for a moment.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And now - as it is custom - the king and queen will have their first dance.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ON THE DANCE FLOOR:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy and Josie begin to dance. From Josie's P.O.V., it's in SLOW MOTION, the world glittering and wonderful around her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey--what are you thinking about?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--\"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold\".\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What about you? What are you thinking about?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(taking a beat, happily)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">My sword.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's like a switch has been flicked on in Josie's brain.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You said that already.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - BUFFET - MINUTES LATER\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face with Sam. They're both taken aback by the other's beauty.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks. So do you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They both laugh, embarrassed, at Josie's flub.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">An awkward beat.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You wanna--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He gestures towards the dance floor. Josie smiles.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, okay--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And they walk off onto the dance floor.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE ON: THE SIDE OF THE DANCE FLOOR.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy approaches Aldys.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, listen--it's prom. How about we let all the old shit go. Would you like to dance?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aldys can't help it.

They're so final. Graduation.

And you can't really promenade alone, can you?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam smiles at this.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're amazing, Josie Geller.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE ON: GUY AND ALDYS as they dance, WE SEE the Cool Girls and Jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing Gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a CAN OF ALPO. She hands it to Jason who pulls a CAN OPENER out of his pocket, opens the lid. He hands it to Kirsten who take the lid off. She hands the can to Kristen, who hands the can to Tommy.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SAM\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, I have.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSE UP on Josie's HAND as she subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There's something I have to tell you--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Her foot comes down on top of it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">George is making out with his Date when the monitor suddenly FRITZES OFF.

She spots Aldys, who smiles at her. Josie's eyes travel up to the can of DOG FOOD.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">FLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">on the porch, facing Billy and his Date.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">FLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">with egg dripping all over her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">BACK TO PRESENT.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">NOOOOOOO!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">SLOW MOTION as Josie lunges for Aldys and pulls her to floor as Tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down Guy's front. The Crowd stops dead, staring. The can, now empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise ECHOING in the silence.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Josie)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What is your problem?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GIBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I knew it. You are a loser.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KRISTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You ruined the whole thing!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KIRSTEN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You so do not deserve to be prom queen.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone is still staring. It's dead quiet.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me tell you something.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It is still silent. Josie takes a deep breath, and looks around the room.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't care about being the prom queen. I am twenty five years old.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Looks of confusion and teenage disgust. Rob is pissed.

She's on a roll.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I want to tell you something. You people- Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss out on so much.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(indicating Aldys)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Why her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my friends only after my brother, Rob...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She points out Rob in the crowd. He's mortified.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">posed as a student and told you to like me. But y'know--l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But not as good as being myself.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(turns to crowd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And to all of you-- there's a big world out there. Bigger than prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. What matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are-What if Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn't \"cool\"?

Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore!

It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie stands.

SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie, looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase, bounds up the steps, two at a time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks down the hall, purposefully - she is on a mission. Groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this time, Josie doesn't even notice.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As Josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with Guy, who is at his locker. He looks at her. She smiles. And now it is Guy that is nervous. He drops a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. Josie looks at him - and for the first time we see it register on her face - this guy is just a seventeen- year-old kid.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh, hey, umm--Ms. Geller. This is totally embarrassing but my mom, she's all worried about me getting a job after graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me, at the Sun Times?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie smiles big.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll do what I can. And tell your mom not to worry - you'll do O.K.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie continues down the hall.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. LOCKER ROOM - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The guys' locker room. A bunch of GUYS are getting dressed after P.

COVER UP WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SEEN!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And with that Josie comes walking into the locker room, completely unruffled, and storms over to Coach Romano's office, just as he is leaving it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller, from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the Sun Times, Jim Lakin?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COACH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sure, every coach in the area tries to get Jim to cover his team.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie puts her arm around the coach, and leads him back into his own office.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, what would you say if I told you that I could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COACH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'd say you can have whatever the hell you want.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie smiles, together they enter his office and close the door.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie sits at her disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Someone once told me that to write well you have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. GUS' OFFICE - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gus comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the \"Life and Style\" section.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And there it is. Front page - \"NEVER BEEN KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER.\" There are three pictures next to the article. One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">High school was more of the same. Then, at seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke. I have never fully recovered.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUHCHROOH - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Anita and Cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch room, over a shared bag of microwave popcorn. They are astounded-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, it is embarrassing to share this with the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I learned it, without sharing this humiliating history.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. A HOUSE - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Sun Times lies on the front mat. The door opens; we see a pair of bare feet. A hand reaches down to grab the paper. WE PAN UP to reveal Sam in all his depressed glory--sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I received an assignment, my first as a reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst nightmare.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam shuts the door.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kids stream into school.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What I found?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. MRS.

The ones that, even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The BASEBALL TEAM as they practice-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The athletes - and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SCIENCE LAB - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aldys and the Denominators- making smores over a bunson burner getting into a melted chocolate and marshmallow fight- and laughing hysterically-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The smart kids. Who everyone else always knew as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my friends.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy, Tommy and Jason, as they get out Guy's car, in the parking lot-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And there's still that one guy, the one who is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We focus in on Guy, as he takes the front steps two at a time-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">- to the way he, in his own way, struggles to uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him. High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the same without him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Guy, his buddies, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, sign yearbooks, hang out by the lockers-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">All of these things made me miserable at seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us. A time that makes us who we are, for years to come.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HANDS grab Chicago Sun Times at the newsstand-\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">High school- going through it the first time- helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that who I am is O.K. I always wanted to be \"in\", but seven years later, when they finally opened the door, I somehow gained the confidence to stay outside, firmly, happily.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. \"EL\" TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">About 75% of the people have their Life and Style sections opened, reading Josie's piece.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is not the article I was sent in to write. This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second, my regrets are down to one.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The kitchen of a depressed guy--empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant. Sam pours milk into a bowl of Lucky Charms while he reads the Sports Section of the paper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A certain teacher was trampled in my path to self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no way makes up for what I did to him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He's not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl, soaking the table.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">To this man, you know who you are, I am so sorry.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up the remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash can. He leaves the kitchen. WE HOLD ON the empty room.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And, I would like to add one more thing - I think I am in love with you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. BASEBALL, STADIUM PARKING LOT \u0096 NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And so I propose this - as an ending to this article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game \u0096 where my friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR.

If this man accepts my apology, I ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real kiss.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Five minutes may seem like a short time, but trust me, when you've been waiting twenty-five years, it's usually the last five minutes that kill you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CU: THE PICTURE TAKEN OF JOSIE AND SAM AT THE PROM.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I went back to high school and discovered I was a loser, again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WIDEN TO REVEAL the picture on the fridge in--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - EVENING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam enters, still in sweats, carrying a book. He opens the fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it, is confronted by Josie's picture. He takes it down, looks at it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And then I discovered it wasn't so bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that I'm ready to start living the rest of my life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sam lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WE FOLLOW Sam's stare down into the trash and see the photo lying on top and to the side of Josie's article--the photos from the article are clearly visible.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">ANGLE ON HOT DOGS, POPCORN CHANGING HANDS being sold by the truckload at the stadium. The crowds are over capacity. Way over. People fill the parking lot, they cover every other inch of school grounds, as well. They stand on the roofs of nearby buildings, they sit on top of their cars. It looks like most of Chicago is either already there, or on their way.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Some WOMEN hold signs for Josie, others hold and wave her article.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie sticks her head out of the dugout, and looks out at the fans. TV REPORTERS are everywhere, including several on the field. She looks like she may faint. She ducks back in.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INTERIOR. DUGOUT - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The team is dressed, ready, excited. Anita and Aldys stand next to Josie. Josie looks up at the crowd, amazed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wow. It's packed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANITA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALDYS\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well I'm so glad that you guys are.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie then starts to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her ankles. Anita and Aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to Josie. She hyperventilates into it. Coach Romano approaches. Josie puts the bag down.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COACH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there'd be all these TV crews here. This thing's gonna be on every station in the country.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COACH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You more than kept your end of the bargain. Now go out there and get 'em.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass. She hugs Aldys. Then Anita gives Josie a big hug, and won't let go. Josie has to pull Anita pulls back. Josie struggles to get out of the hug- Anita won't let her. Finally, they are both laughing.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Josie walks out of the dugout, and onto the field.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She walks, alone, out to the pitcher's mound, clutching a microphone. The crowd goes berserk. She stands until they quiet.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JOSIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Could I have five minutes on the clock, please?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The scoreboard clock reads 5:00.
