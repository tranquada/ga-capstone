We hear the chanting of a crowd.\nCROWD\nJosie! Josie! Josie!\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nYou know in some movies how they have a dream sequence only they don't tell you it's a dream?\nPull out to reveal Josie on pitcher's mound of a--\nEXTERIOR. A BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT\nIt's packed. Reporters line the field. All eyes are on Josie.\nJOSIE\n (V.O.)\nThis is so not a dream.\nThe stadium clock sets at 5:00. The crowd goes crazy. Josie takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, \"Oh God.\"\nINTERIOR. ELECTRONICS STORE -- CONTINUOUS\nMultiple images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered.\nJOSIE\n (V.O.)\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here.\nEXTERIOR. BASEBALL STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS\nThe clock starts to tick down. The crowd yells again.\nJOSIE\n (V.O.)\nTrust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd...\nINTERIOR. CHICAGO SUN TIMES BULLPEN -- DAY\nPacked with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the crowd.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nTold you. I'm over there.\nThe camera swings to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand.\nRHODA\nTheater--\nJOSIE\nStandard American calls for \"er\". Standard British is \"re\". So go for \"er\", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British.\nJosie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her wake.\nRHODA\nNo. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember?\nJosie stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he talks, ignoring Josie.\nMERKIN\n(into phone)\nNo way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on.\n(to Josie)\nWhat.\nJOSIE\nMessages?\nMerkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie. Disgusted, she takes it by one corner.\nMERKIN\n(into phone)\nSeriously? No way. No way--\nJosie's still standing there.\nMERKIN\nWhat\nJOSIE\nMerkin, do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're--\nMerkin swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone call.\nMERKIN\n(back into phone)\nOkay, I'm back, so--\nJosie sighs, walks to her door. It's marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy Editor. She adjusts the plate so it's perfectly straight.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS\nJosie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles, satisfied, ready for another day.\nAnita Brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi-unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling.\nANITA\nGuess who I did it with last night...\nJOSIE \n(duh)\nRoger in Op/Ed.\nANITA\nWho told!\nJOSIE\nYou did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, \"I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him.\"\nANITA\nWell, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.\nJosie just stares at her.\nANITA\nOnce it didn't happen for sure.\nGus Strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy onto Josie's desk.\nGUS\nComputer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.\nJOSIE\n(emphasizing)\nIt is hoped that it's not a mess. \"Hopefully\" is an adverb. It means \"with hope\". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.\nGus and Anita just stare at Josie.\nJOSIE\nWell, excuse me for caring about words.\nGUS \n(to Anita)\nSo. You and Roger in Op/Ed.\nANITA\nOh, man! Who told?\nGUS\nRoger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.\nJOSIE\nIntra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.\nANITA\nAnd what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?\nAnita flounces off.\nGUS\nHow many times have I fired her?\nJOSIE\nFive-- Six--\nGUS\n(shrugging, giving up)\nEh.\nGus turns to exit.\nJOSIE\nHey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?\nGUS\nYeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.\nJOSIE\n(disappointed)\nOh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.\nGUS\nGeller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.\nJOSIE\nYou've done five of my ideas.\nGUS\nYou know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?\nJOSIE\nThey don't have to be in the office Christmas show?\nGUS\nA flack jacket.\nJOSIE\n(not getting it)\nA--flack jacket.\nGUS\nEvery Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.\nJOSIE\nYou don't think I can grab bulls' balls?\nGUS\nGeller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.\nJOSIE\nHey--I can be out of control.\nGus smiles. On his way out he re-adjusts Josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it.\nGUS\n(over his shoulder)\nCopy by five.\nINTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUNCHROOM -- DAY\nActually, a pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch--Anita eats Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her.\nJOSIE\nBe honest. Do you think I'm aggressive?\nAnita ponders a moment.\nANITA\nOkay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?\nJOSIE\nYeah.\nANITA\nYou stood for like a month.\nCynthia, an affable African-American woman in her 40's, enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave.\nJOSIE\nJust because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write.\nCYNTHIA\nJosie, you listen to me. If you feel you're a writer--(touching her chest)\nHere, deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being.\nJOSIE\nYou write obituaries.\nCYNTHIA\nHey, if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art.\nThe microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look.\nANITA\nCynthia, aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time?\nCYNTHIA\nI eat 'em one at a time.\nANITA\n(to Josie)\nY'know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date.\nJOSIE\nForget it.\nANITA\nI swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?\nJOSIE\nI'm concentrating on my career right now.\nANITA\nDo you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!\nJOSIE\n(embarrassed)\nAnita!\nANITA\nLook. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy\u0097\n(beat)\nIf you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.\nJosie laughs in spite of herself.\nJOSIE\nThe right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.\nANITA\nYeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.\nJOSIE\nWhen I finally get kissed, I'll know.\nAnita and Cynthia trade looks.\nANITA\nOkay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.\nJOSIE\nI've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--\nCYNTHIA\n\"That thing\"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days?\nJOSIE\nThat thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away.\nAnita and Cynthia take this in.\nCYNTHIA\nDamn, girl. You are a writer.\nINTERIOR. TIKI POST -- DAY\nBasically a Mailbox Etc. store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold Fedex envelopes.\nRob Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with \"Tiki Post\" emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the cash register.\nMonty Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The place is empty.\nROB\nHey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?\nMONTY\n(of course)\nI'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?\nROB\nI think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.\nMONTY\nChange is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!\nROB\nI thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.\nJosie walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian music. Monty puts a lei over her head.\nMONTY\nAloha! Welcome!\nROB\nRelax, Monty. It's just my sister.\nMonty takes the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through the cash inside.\nROB\nThanks, Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too.\nRob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked outside.\nJOSIE\nThat is so--weird that you name your car.\nROB\nNo it's not. Guys name their penises.\nJOSIE\nOkaaaay....(then)\nThat car's going to bankrupt you.\nROB\nShe just needs a new windshield wiper.\nJOSIE\nBecause I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.\nRob hands the money back.\nROB\nY'know what? Take it. I don't want it.\nJosie hands it back.\nJOSIE\nRob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.\nROB\nNo, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your \"things that make you a better person than me\" list.\nJOSIE\nBetter person than I.\nROB\nSee!\nJOSIE\nI know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--\nROB\nI'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.\nJOSIE\n(whispering)\nThis--this is a luau that sells packing material!\nROB\nSomeday this luau is going to be all mine!\nJOSIE\nHow can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?\nROB\nOh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!\nJOSIE\nFor your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!\nShe exits. The music starts up again.\nMONTY\nCome again!\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\nWe pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever seen. Lots of books on shelves.\nWe find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says: \"LOVE\". She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.\nJOSIE\nThere. What d'you think, guys? Where should it go?\nJosie looks around the living room.\nJOSIE\nHmm.\n(She pretends to listen to the turtles.)\nWhat's that? Bedroom? Great idea!\nShe walks into the bedroom with the pillow.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS\nA perfectly arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles.\nJOSIE\nPerfect.\nINTERIOR. A CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME\nIt's packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.\nRIGFORT\nLet me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets.\nAn older man, Dutton, smiles proudly.\nRIGFORT\nBut since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired.\nDutton's face falls. Everyone looks horrified.\nRIGFORT\nYou heard me. Out. Out.\nDutton shuffles out. Josie takes a big bite of donut.\nRIGFORT\nSo. Happy March everybody!\nALL\n(by rote)\nHappy March Mr. Rigfort.\nRIGFORT\nTo celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature!\nEveryone looks underwhelmed.\nRIGFORT\nYou all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- \"hair today, gone tomorrow\"? Hat's off to you, Bruns.\nWe pan over to Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods sadly.\nRIGFORT\nOr should I say \"hat's on\"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier.\nHoward smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters.\nRIGFORT\nSo last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we're eating chicken with this peanut sauce.\nCamera stops at a Chef Boyardee look-alike.\nGUS\nUndercover chef. I like it.\nRIGFORT\nHang on, Gus. So, we're eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking.\nCamera stops at a Nurse Ratchet look-alike.\nANITA\n(sotto to Josie)\nI'm smelling undercover ER nurse.\nRIGFORT\nTurns out he's allergic to peanuts. And I think -- holy shit. I don't even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if they're even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It hit me -- \"My Semester In High School.\"\nCamera stops at a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to Josie.\nRIGFORT\n(to Josie)\nYou. What's your name.\nJOSIE\nJosie. Josie Geller.\nRIGFORT\nYou enroll on Friday.\nGeneral crowd hubub. Josie's in shock.\nJOSIE\nOh. But--I'm not a reporter yet...\nRIGFORT\nAnd none of these geezers could pass for a day under 40. Have fun.\nAnd Rigfort exits.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER\nJosie is so excited she can hardly speak to Anita.\nJOSIE\nIt's finally happening, Anita! I'm going to write!\nAnita looks concerned.\nJOSIE\nMy own undercover feature - \"Written by Josie Geller\".\nANITA\nJos - Maybe you should turn it down.\nA beat. Josie's face falls.\nJOSIE\nYou don't think I can do it.\nANITA\nNo - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!\nGus enters.\nGUS\nDon't worry, I'll straighten all this out.\nJOSIE\nBut I don't want it straightened out.\nGUS\nGeller, this is way out of your league.\nJosie takes in Anita and Gus.\nJOSIE\nOkay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.\nANITA\nJos, that's not what we're --\nJOSIE\nAnita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?\nAnita looks down, chastened.\nANITA\nSenorita Josie.\nJOSIE\nAnd Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?\nGUS\n(sotto)\nYou did.\nANITA\n(to Gus)\nYou knit?\nJOSIE\nSo, this is my chance.\nA beat.\nGUS\nI'm not holding your job for you, Geller.\nJosie jumps up and down and hugs Gus, who is clearly uncomfortable.\nGUS\nDon't make me send you the memo on hugging in the workplace.\nJosie smiles. Gus exits.\nANITA\nI do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need, I'll help you out.\nJosie sits, motions to the brown paper bag.\nJOSIE\nYou can start by handing me that bag.\nAnita does. Josie sticks it over her face, flips her head between her knees and starts hyperventilating again.\nClose up on Rob, wearing his Tiki Post outfit. He shakes his head.\nROB\nNo. Uh, uh.\nPull out to reveal him standing with Josie on the sidewalk in front of -\nEXTERIOR. TIKI POST - DAY\nJosie's shiny Buick is parked right behind Bambi at the curb.\nJOSIE\nIt's just for a couple of months.\nROB\nYou can't just \"borrow\" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!\nJOSIE\nI'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.\nRob rolls his eyes and enters the store.\nJOSIE\nYou can name it whatever you want.\nINTERIOR. TIKI POST - CONTINUOUS\nJosie follows Rob into the store. He turns.\nROB\nWow. This must be big.\nJOSIE\nI got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.\nRob starts laughing uncontrollably.\nJOSIE\nWhat!?\nROB\nDo you remember high school?\nJOSIE\nIt was a long time ago -\nROB\nDon't you remember what they called you?\nSlowly Josie's face falls. She looks very far away.\nROB\nJosie -\nINTERIOR. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)\nIt's packed with kids. Everyone stares off-screen at chants -\nALL\nJosie Grossie. Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie.\nINTERIOR. TIKI POST - SAME\nJosie looks stricken.\nJOSIE\nJosie Grossie.\nROB\nI know. I came up with it.\n(beat)\nYou look nauseous.\nJOSIE\nNauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.\nShe puts her hand over her mouth, races for the bathroom.\nINTERIOR. TIKI POST BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER\nJosie has just gotten violently ill. She rises off her knees, grabs some toilet paper to wipe her mouth. She looks down at her feet.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\nWe close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage JOSIE\nbraces, heavy glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking down the corridor with a huge backpack on her back.\nA boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk Sprite into her backback.\nKids smile and snicker as Josie continues down the hallway. She spots, Billy Prince, ultmate high school heartthrob, and approaches him nervously.\nJOSIE\nHey, Billy Prince, I noticed you weren't in math today, and I have the notes in case you want -\nMidway through Josie's speech, we hear the odd sound of liquid hitting linoleum. Josie follow Billy's gaze down to between her feet where a pool of Sprite has gathered. Billy starts to laugh. Kids around him join in. As the laughter echoes around her we DISSOLVE BACK TO:\nINTERIOR. TIKI POST BATHROOM - SAME (PRESENT DAY)\nJosie stares into the mirror. Staring back is teenage Josie.\nJOSIE\nThis is a very bad idea.\nINTERIOR. THE MALL - TEEN CLOTHING STORE - DAY\nAnita and Josie cruise through a teen clothing store, carrying large bags from a stationery store. Josie picks up a platform sneaker and just stares at it.\nANITA\nSo, you were a geek. Big deal.\nJOSIE\nAnita, remember espadrilles?\nANITA\nPlease. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.\nJOSIE\nThe girls threw them at me in the locker room.\nANITA\nOkay. That's bad.\nJOSIE\nAt the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.\nANITA\nMama mia.\n(then)\nJust because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.\nAnita pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it up.\nANITA\nNow this is cute.\nJOSIE\nThat is lingerie.\nANITA\nSo I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.\nJOSIE\nWhat'd you feel when you kissed him?\nANITA\nBridgework?\nJOSIE\nVery romantic.\nJosie pulls out a plain button-down cardigan.\nJOSIE\nHow about this?\nANITA\nI am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.\nAnita grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching earrings and holds them up.\nANITA\nCuuuute!\nJOSIE\n'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.\nANITA\nAnd we're going to have to do something about your hair.\nJOSIE\nAnita!\nANITA\nJos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!\nSMASH CUT TO: CLOSE UP - AN ALARM CLOCK\non a bedside table. Surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair color, a stack of index cards, ripped magazine pages of teen looks, issues of Teen Beat and YM. The clock slips to 7:00. NPR starts playing. A hand reaches over, hits the radio off. SOUND EFFECTS: A school bell. As the bell continues to ring, we widen to:\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING\nJosie sits up in bed, covers pulled up to her chin in terror.\nEXTERIOR. A CHICAGO STREET - MORNING\nMUSIC UP: \"Morning Train\". Crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto the stairs leading up to the El.\nA big yellow car jerks into frame, backfires noisily. It's Josie at the wheel of Bambi. She jerks out of frame.\nEXTERIOR. SOUTH GLEN SOUTH HIGH SCHOOOL - MORNING\nA suburban campus anchored by a main building. Cars pull into the parking lot for the beginning of the day. Kids greet each other, converge on the front doors of the school. General mayhem.\nBambi pulls in. She jerks into a spot, backfiring once more for effect. The entire scene stops. Kids freeze, look at Josie. A beat, and they they continue on their way.\nINTERIOR. BAMBI - CONTINUOUS\nJosie takes a few deep breaths.\nJOSIE\nOkay, I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do this.\nEXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS\nJosie steps out of the car wearing the maribou jacket, earrings, and white jeans. She shuts the door behing her, starts walking. She has unknowingly shut her jacket in the door and as she walks, a piece of maribou rips, trailing behind her like a tail.\nJOSIE\nYeah, okay. Feeling good...\nINTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - SAME\nJosie merges with the throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby. She stares around, overwhelmed. \"Go Rams!\" banners share space with signs that read: \"63 DAYS TIL PROM!\" She inches her way along the wall until she is stopped by a guard who grabs her arm.\nGUARD\nHey--where are you going?\nJOSIE\nOh, I'm a student. Most definitely a student. In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students.\n(greeting random kids)\nHi. Hi there.\nThe guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them, to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through. Josie smiles, \"whoops,\" walks back.\nGUARD\n(under his breath)\nFreak.\nINTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - MINUTES LATER\nJosie's stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell phone, laptop, mini tape recorder, electronic organizer, pager, being scrutinized by the guard. Josie's sure she's been found out. Camera widens. Down from Josie, we see other kids' belongings spread out. They have the identical high-tech equipment. The guard picks up Josie's nail file, examines it -\nGUARD\nWeapon.\nAnd throws it in the trash.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING\nJosie stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, totally lost. She approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans.\nJOSIE\nHi--um, I'm looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox?\nAs soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth - a tongue pierce. Josie does too. We zoom in on that shiny little metal ball. Josie is fixated. So fixated that we stop hearing the boy's voice. All we see is the mouth - and that ball - moving. The mouth closes. He's done. Josie's face is contorted in imagined pain.\nJOSIE\nOw.\n(catching herself)\nI mean, wow. Wow. Great directions. Clear. Concise.\nAnd Josie takes off, totally embarrassed.\nBOY\n(under his breath)\nFreak.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING\nJosie walks up to Room 204. Opening the door, she's met by a sea of faces.\nMs. Knox, mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the front of the class.\nMS. KNOX\nHi - hello. Wilkommen. Entre.\nJosie walks in. Kids whisper and snicker.\nJOSIE\nSorry I'm late.\nMS. KNOX\nYes, well, I'm sorry I forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es su casa.\nJosie makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. The class titters. She sits in front of two girls, Kirsten and Kristen, beautiful and intimidating.\nKIRSTEN\nThat is so sad --\nKRISTEN\nI know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.\nMS. KNOX\nJosie, in my classroom, tardiness is unacceptable --\nJOSIE\nI'm really sorry --\nMs. Knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk. The class laughs in recognition.\nMS. KNOX\nNot as sorry as I am.\nMs. Knox puts the sombrero on a less-than-thrilled Josie.\nMS. KNOX\nOle! Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up.\nJosie does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard --it's filled with precise script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins --\nJOSIE\nMy name is Josie. I'm a high school student. I came from --\nJust then the classroom door opens. We see from Josie's perspective a blinding light, Josie squints. From the light emerges a shadowy vision of Billy Prince.\nJOSIE\nBilly?\nJosie blinks, REVEAL not Billy, but a beautiful guy, Guy. He stands very close to her.\nJOSIE\n(catching herself)\nBali.\n(another beat)\nI'm from Billy-Bali. It's a suburb of Bali proper.\nGuy pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to Ms. Knox, and moves to his seat.\nMS. KNOX\nBali. Fascinating! What did your family do there?\nJosie looks around in panic, sees a student in a South Glen South windbreaker with huge ram on the back.\nJOSIE\nWe were--sheep--farmers. We raised sheep. In Billy-Bali.\nJosie realizes the trouble she's gotten herself into.\nJOSIE\nOh my God.\n(caught)\nOh my God--do I miss Billy-Bali.\n(beat)\nIt had--a really great...aquarium.\nShe sits. Defeated.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\nJosie rushes down the hall, still toting her enormous bag. A huge banner - SOUTH GLEN, OUR NATION'S BEST PROM - hangs prominently. She talks covertly into a hand-held tape recorder.\nJOSIE\nNote to self--Research Bali. Kill Anita for picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero.\nINTERIOR. CLASSROOM - SAME\nJosie and her enormous bookbag enter. She takes a seat toward the back of the room.\nKristen, Kirsten and GIBBY, another beauty, enter and head to the back of the room.\nKirsten and Gibby stand over Josie, staring at her.\nKIRSTEN\nWe sit here.\nJOSIE\nOh. Sorry--I didn't know these were assigned.\nGIBBY:\nThey're not.\nJosie quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward, next to two empty seats. TWO STONERS shuffle over to Josie.\nSTONER 1\nSorry. We sit here.\nJOSIE\n(indicating two empty seats)\nCouldn't you two--sit there?\nSTONER 2\nRight. Except there are three of us--\nThe Stoners eye each other, then the two seats. A look of horror comes over Stoner 1.\nSTONER 1(cont'd)\nDude--we left Jed at the 7-11!\n(beat)\nAgain!\nJosie picks up her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in the room-in the front row, surrounded by \"Denominators\" who all wear orange Denominator sweatshirts.\nSitting next to Josie is ALDYS, a Denominator--intense, wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. She smiles at Josie.\nJosie smiles back and looks up as MR. COULSON enters the room. He's a ruggedly handsome twenty-something Yale grad.\nHe grabs a notebook out of his bag, goes around to sit on the front of his desk, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.\nSAM\nHi, everyone.\n(Spots Josie)\nI don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.\nJOSIE\n(shyly)\nI'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.\nSam smiles.\nSAM\nJosie since you're new--I love to drink my coffee during class, and since I allow myself to do this, I allow everyone to bring beverages to class as well.\n(a beat)\nwelcome to Shakespeare's \"As You Like It.\"\n(beat)\nOkay. How many of you actually read the assignment last night?\nAbout five hands go up.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nNot bad. Now how many of you spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods?\nTwenty hands. Sam laughs.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nMan. If I could just get you guys to read while you eat.\nSam opens his book. Aldys notices Josie has no book. She moves next to her.\nALDYS\nHere. We can share.\nThey share a smile.\nSAM\n'As You Like It\" is an example of a Shakespearean--\nSam turns to the blackboard and starts writing. We CU on his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all the girls swoon.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nPastoral Comedy. Anyone know what that means?\nAn enthusiastic, if slightly dim girl, SERA, waves her hand.\nSERA\nOh oh oh! That's what they do to milk!\nSAM\nThat's pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same letter--\n(tapping three fingers on his arm a la charades)\n--three syllables--\nSERA\nParakeet?!\nALDYS:\n(sotto to Josie)\nThere's a minute of my life I'll never get back.\nJosie smiles at this.\nSAM\nOkay, anyone else---\nJosie can't contain herself.\nJOSIE\nPastoral means set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It's from the Latin pascere. To graze.\nStudent bleets like a sheep O.S. Sam just stares at her, smiling. Finally, he walks over and shakes her hand.\nSAM\nDid I mention to the class that I love our new student?\nJosie beams.\nGIBBY\nDid I mention that the class also loves our new kiss ass?\nJosie's smile quickly fades.\nSAM\nGibby, that's not exactly the kind of participation I'm looking for.\nGibby looks right at Josie.\nGIBBY\n(totally insincere)\nOoops. Sorry.\nJosie just sits there, face burning.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\nJosie approaches her locker. She can't get to it because a COUPLE is busy making out against it.\nA GIRL'S VOICE comes over the loudspeaker. She's completely ignored.\nGIRL'S VOICE\nHi. This is Sydney, Student Body President! Okay, first. Bad news-The' district didn't allocate enough funds, so as of this afternoon, there will be no music department. Now, about Prom--\nThe entire hallway FREEZES. The couple breaks their clinch and looks up. SILENCE. Josie is amazed.\nSYDNEY\u0092S VOICE\nVoting on Prom theme has been completed. And the theme is--\nCU on expectant FACES.\nSYDNEY\u0092S VOICE\n (cont'd)\nThe Millennium!\nPANDEMONIUM. Kids cheer, gasp. One GIRL faints.\nThe crowd surges again. Josie, caught in the flow, doesn't notice a locker door flinging open. She smashes her face right into it. Everyone, including Guy, turns and laughs. Even some Denominators.\nCUT TO\nCU: A CAFETERIA TRAY\nMoves down the food line. It's piled with unidentifiable foods and three glasses of fluorescent red punch. Hands pull the tray out of the frame. INTO FRAME comes another tray, this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting with three celery sticks on a plate. WIDEN TO REVEAL:\nINTERIOR. CAFETERIA - DAY\nJosie, pulling the perfect tray down the cafeteria line. She reaches some awful-looking Cole slaw in a big vat. A CAFETERIA GUY in a plastic cap hovers above it.\nJOSIE\n(to cafeteria guy)\nExcuse me. What's in the Cole slaw?\nThe cafeteria guy hauls an industrial-size plastic tub onto the, counter and turns it-so Josie can read the label: \"KOLE SLAW FOOD.\" Josie wrinkles her nose. She moves on to the cash register.\nCASHIER\nThat'll be twelve ninety-five.\nJOSIE\n(stunned)\nOh my gosh. Wow. That's... pricey.\nCASHIER\nThat's real meat in the ham sandwich.\nJosie turns to a GIRL in line behind her.\nJOSIE\nBoy--that's a lot of bread for that bread!\nThe Girl rolls her eyes, reaches past Josie to grab a mustard bottle. Josie turns with her tray toward the room.\nCUT TO\nINTERIOR. CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK) 4 KIDS stare at CAMERA and chant:\nALL\nJosie Grossie--Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie.\nANGLE BACK ON JOSIE. She's seventeen. Standing with her tray, paralyzed. The CAMERA SPINS, showing us her back. There, tattooed in squeeze-bottle mustard, is \"GROSSIE.\" A boy stands behind her victoriously holding the mustard bottle.\nCUT BACK TO\nINTERIOR. CAFETERIA - SAME (PRESENT DAY)\nJosie shakes off the vision and stares out at the crowded cafeteria. She sees Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, steels herself, and decides to approach.\nKirsten is eating a bran muffin.\nKRISTEN\nKirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.\nKIRSTEN\nNah uh.\nGIBBY\nYeah, I read this thing that one bran muffin can be like two bran muffins sometimes.\nKirsten pushes the muffin away.\nKIRSTEN\nGod. Food is so confusing.\nJOSIE\n(to Kirsten)\nHi Kristen.\nKIRSTEN\nIt's Kirsten.\nJosie plops herself down with these girls, and takes a spiral pad out of her big knapsack. In the process, she manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white jeans.\nJOSIE\nThat'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.\nGIBBY\nUmm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.\nThey all laugh. Josie fakes a laugh, too.\nJOSIE\nRight, right.\nJosie picks up her notepad and her pen.\nJOSIE\nSo - tell me about yourselves.\nThey all just stare at Josie in disgust. Guy approaches their table.\nGUY\nI'm Guy.\nGuy looks at Josie. He's beautiful. She's flustered.\nJOSIE\nYes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.\n(beat)\nYikes.\n(beat)\nBikes!\nGUY\n(very serious)\nAre you in special ed?\nJosie stands up, grabs her bag and her chocolate milk-\nJOSIE\nBye. Guy. Others.\nShe leaves the Cafeteria, passing a-couple of Denominators.\nJOSIE\n(to herself)\nAaaah! How old am I?\nDENOMINATOR #1\nApproximately six thousand three hundred and fifty days old- subject to adjustment for month of birth.\nThis is very funny Denominator humor- to the Denominators. Josie leaves the Cafeteria.\nEXTERIOR. SCHOOL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS\nJosie runs out an exit door and right into a SECURITY GUARD\nGUARD\nYou got a pass?\nINTERIOR. GYM - LATER\nA banner above reads \"PRESIDENTIAL FITNESS TESTING THIS WEEK.\" FIFTEEN SENIOR GIRLS, including Josie, in matching green and yellow polyester gym clothes do sprints up and-down the basketball court. Josie looks like she's about to die. Ms. Brown yells as she passes.\nMS. BROWN\nmove it Geller! Move it! Move it!\nJosie stops, grabs the woman by the shoulders.\nJOSIE\nMust--have--water--\nMS. BROWN\nWhat do I look like, your waitress? Now you're gonna complete these sprints, cause if you don't you fail. And if you fail gym, you're NEVER GETTING INTO COLLEGE!\nJOSIE\nOh--my--God--you guys are\u0097still telling that lie--?\nMS. BROWN\nThat's it Geller--drop and give me twenty!\nJosie drops to the gym floor.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\nIt's - finally- the end of the day. Josie makes her way down the hall, clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed and shoved by kids as they storm outside. A huge banner hangs overhead reading: \"SIGN UP FOR SENIOR NIGHT!\"\nShe tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her.\nShe makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we see, as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag, it is completely blank.\nEXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - SAME\nKids fill the parking lot. Josie walks, talking on her cell phone.\nJOSIE\n(into phone)\nRhoda, make sure Gus gets-the whole message, okay? Yeah--bye--\nJosie arrives where she parked Bambi. The space is empty. She still holds the phone to her ear--\nJOSIE\nWait a second--\n(into phone)\nNo, not you--bye--\nJosie shuts the phone, looks around...retraces her steps ... Bambi is gone.\nJosie walks around the lot, getting visibly upset.\nIn the corner of the lot, we see a group of Denominators removing a BIG METAL CHAIN from around a group of tightly packed cars.\nALDYS\n (O.S.)\nThey do it to all the new kids.\nJosie finds Aldys standing next to her.\nJOSIE\nWho's of they?\nAldys motions up to a second floor window. Guy and his Group look down on them, laughing.\nALDYS\nGuy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.\nJOSIE\nI'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.\nALDYS\nWhen it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.\nJOSIE\nTry being named after a guitar-playing pussycat.\nAldys doesn't get it.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nNever mind.\n(beat)\nThat is so awful that they hide your cars.\nALDYS\nI guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-\nShe points up to the biology room-\nALDYS\nThey still would not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole.\nJosie laughs.\nJOSIE\nI know. It's pathetic.\nAldys stares Josie down.\nJOSIE\nWhat?\nALDYS\nWell, do you?\nJOSIE\nSynecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in \" head of cattle\", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like \"I could eat a horse.\"\nALDYS\nNice.\nThey stop and look around.\nJOSIE\nHow long will they watch us for?\nALDYS\nUntil Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.\nJOSIE\nWhy do they listen to Guy?\nALDYS:\n(duh)\nBecause he's Guy Perkins.\n(then)\nListen, you want to walk to Na-Na's and get something to eat?\nJOSIE\nYeah. Let's do that.\nThey start to walk out of the parking lot. Josie is visibly thrilled - having finally found a friend.\nINTERIOR. NA-NA'S - LATER\nJosie and Aldys share a huge plate of chili fries.\nALDYS\nYeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.\nJOSIE\nOh I know.\nA WAITER delivers two huge chocolate shakes.\nALDYS\nI'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.\nJOSIE\nHey--I went to Northwestern!\n(a beat)\nOnce. To use the bathroom.\nOUT THE WINDOW, Josie sees her Buick with Rob at the wheel stopped at a red light. Detailed on to the side in big white script is:\n\"THE TIKI POST\". Josie's eyes widen. The light changes. Rob pulls away.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\n(So angry)\nOh. My. God.\n(a beat)\nYou'll really like Northwestern.\nThey both slurp down their shakes.\nJOSIE\nSo what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?\nALDYS\nProfessor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.\nAldys takes another slurp of her shake. WE HEAR a muffled cell phone RINGING.\nALDYS\n (cont'd)\nI think your knapsack is ringing.\nJosie takes the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers it.\nJOSIE\nHello?\nWE INTERCUT WITH:\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - SAME\nGus speaks into his phone, knitting frantically.\nGUS\nGeller, I got your message. What the hell kind of story are you pitching?!\nJosie smiles awkwardly at Aldys, covering the phone.\nJOSIE\nIt's my dad. He worries.\n(into phone)\nHi, Dad. I miss you too.\nGUS\nYou're a sick puppy, Geller.\nJosie indicates to Aldys she'll be right back and walks to the back of the restaurant by the pay phones.\nJOSIE\n(into the phone)\nIt's an expose on cafeteria food.\nGUS\nAnd you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!\nJOSIE\nWell, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--\nGUS\nGeller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!\nGus slams down his phone.\nJOSIE\n(into a dead phone)\nYou didn't taste the pimento loaf.\nShe looks back to the table where Aldys is dividing the check.\nEXTERIOR. TRACK - HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK\nIn the middle of the track is Josie's car. The MARCHING BAND clumsily practices their formations around it. Josie and Aldys arrive at the car and Aldys pops the hood.\nALDYS\nThey love to disconnect the battery, too.\nShe looks under the hood, reconnects the battery. Slams the hood down.\nALDYS\n (cont'd)\nJust so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.\nJOSIE\nThanks.\nALDYS\nSure. No problem.\nAldys heads to the lot for her car, and then turns around.\nALDYS\nHey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?\nJOSIE\nPetty good.\nALDYS\nHow would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.\nJOSIE\nCollege?\nALDYS\nNASA.\n(beat)\nPlus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection\", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.\nJosie smiles. MUSIC UP: SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK'S \"Magic Three\"\nAS WE BEGIN MONTAGE:\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\nJosie and Denominators walk down the hallway in unison, past Guy's Group, open their lockers in order a la \"RESERVOIR DOGS\", take out paper, pencils, calculators.\nINTERIOR. - HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\nJosie and Aldys, both wearing big orange Denominator sweatshirts, are behind a table manning a bake sale.\nA banner behind them says: n = 3.14578697786978 Pie = $.75\nNo one is stopping to buy anything. Josie points to the left, Aldys looks, and Josie stuffs a whole brownie in her mouth. They laugh uncontrollably as Josie starts to choke and cough up most of the brownie.\nWe pan down a row of nervous looking Denominator faces as they watch Josie, sitting head to head against a DIGIT, an opposing Math-a-lon competitor. They both work furiously on a problem. A judge sits between them. A makeshift scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied.\nJosie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her card. He looks it over, and gives her team five points. They win.\nThe Denominators erupt into cheers. They're jumping all over Josie, going crazy. As we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty, except for a handful of Denominators going crazy on one side, and a janitor sweeping up on the other.\nINTERIOR. MALL BOOK STORE - DAY\nSmiling at each other, Josie and Aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line. WE WIDEN to reveal they're in line with NERDY ADULTS also clutching their books. At the head of the line is a blow-up poster for The New Elements Of Grammar. An OLD MAN signs books for his fans.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nIt's late. Josie is typing on her laptop, referencing notes from her notebook. Schoolbooks and homework are spread around her.\nEND MONTAGE.\nINTERIOR. CLASSROOM - DAY\nSam is perched on the desk. The usual players in their usual seats. Aldys is standing and reading from her book.\nALDYS:\n(reading)\n\"All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.\"\nSAM\nAnyone have any idea what Shakespeare meant by that?\nNo one answers.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nAnyone? Sera ... Megan ... exchange student who doesn't speak English?\nWe CU on the students, ending on an Asian boy who smiles wildly at Sam and waves. Sam smiles, and waves back.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nIt's about disguise, playing a part. It's the theme of \"As You Like It.\" Can anyone tell me where we see that?\nALDYS\nWell, Rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest.\nSAM\nRight. And it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life.\nCU on Josie's face. She's clearly uncomfortable. Sam walks up to a huge football player, BRETT.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nBrett when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens?\nBRETT\nWe win?\nSAM\nYou hit people. You yell. You touch other guys' butts.\nThe class giggles. Brett looks horrified.\nSAM\nBut it's okay, because you're in uniform. Disguise changes the rules\n(beat)\nI had these Spiderman pyjamas. I thought when I wore them, that I had super powers. One night I tried to walk up the side of the garage.\nSERA\nDid you make it?\nSAM\nTo the Emergency Room. Yeah.\nJosie smiles at this, a little smitten.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nJosie, why don't you read from Act 5, Scene 2, Rosalind's speech--\nJosie stands up, starts reading--\nJOSIE\n\"No sooner had they met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed...\"\nJosie's voice begins to fade away-\nINTERIOR. CLASSROOM - DAY (FLASHEACK)\nANGLE BACK to Josie, now seventeen and mortified, nervously standing in class and reading a poem. Billy Prince sits to the side--she glances at him throughout the poem, it's clearly about him.\nJOSIE\nDoes he notice me? Does he hear my heart screaming his name-- sometimes it's so loud I think the Gods can hear my pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss.\nThe CLASS laughs at her except for Billy, who smiles at her, looking slightly touched.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY (FLASHBACK)\nSeventeen-year-old Josie is surrounded by an elaborate, color-coded index card system for her research paper.\nHer friend, SHEILA, over-weight and pimply, comes running across the library at breakneck speed. She sits down next to Josie, visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside.\nSHEILA\nO.K., what have you wanted for like ever but you didn't think it would -ever happen?\nJosie looks at her for a moment, mulling it over.\nJOSIE\nThat they'd start an Olympic team for grammar - like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I'm scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I'm so young. But then there's talk of me in the '96 games-\nSHEILA.\nNo-, better. Something better\nJosie smiles.\nJOSIE\nI'm the most popular girl in school, and Billy Prince is taking me to prom.\nJosie laughs at the absurdity. She looks at Sheila. Sheila is dead serious.\nSHEILA\nYes.\nJOSIE\nWhat?\nSHEILA\nBilly Prince is asking you to prom.\nJOSIE\nWhy?\nSHEILA\nI don't know.\nJOSIE\n(beat)\nThe poem! I knew he liked the poem!\n(all sinking in)\nBilly Prince is asking me to the prom.\nSHEILA\nThat's what I'm saying.\nThe two girls look at each other. Big smiles erupt into screams, as they jump up and down, hugging each other.\nSFX - The BELL RINGS.\nINTERIOR. SAM'S CLASSROOM (PRESENT)\n- SAME\nIt's the end of class. Students pack their bags.\nSAM:\n(calling out)\nO.K. - just a reminder. Your paper is due in one week.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME\nAldys and Josie head out of class and down the hallway towards their lockers. Josie stops in front of hers where the Makeout Couple continues their clinch, blocking her locker. Josie pauses frustrated as Sydney's Voice comes over the loudspeaker.\nSYDNEY (O.S.)\nHey guys! Bad news--Chem wing is closed. The Hazardous Materials Crew is on the way. Now, about prom.\nThe entire hallway STOPS to listen. The makeout Couple stop making out.\nSYDNEY (O.S.)\nPlease join a committee--because we are going to KICK NORTHGLEN'S BUTT and make millennium the best prom EVER!\nThe hallway erupts in CHEERS. Josie makes a move to go for her locker. The Makeout Couple are faster. They're back in their clinch, blocking Josie again.\nCU ON GUY\nwalking with his group.\nGUY\nRufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus.\nKRISTEN\nRufus?\nGUY\nYeah. I made it up. Start using it.\nANGLE BACK ON JOSIE AND ALDYS.\nJOSIE\nWhat is with this school and prom?\nALDYS\nSouthglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.\nJOSIE\nAldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.\nALDYS\nThis one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--\nINTERIOR. NORTHGLEN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY KIDS all stare at a loudspeaker.\nKID'S VOICE: (O.S.)\nAnd this year's prom theme is--the millennium!\nThe Northglen kids go crazy.\nINTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME\nJosie reaches for her knapsack, and realizes she left it in English.\nJOSIE\nI left my bag in English. I'll see you later.\nJosie dashes down the hallway.\nINTERIOR. CLASSROOM - SAME\nSam still sits at his desk. He reads a book. Josie enters.\nSAM\nWhoa. Deja Vu.\nJOSIE\nSorry. Forgetful.\nJosie picks up her bookbag. She notices the book Sam's reading--\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\n(excited)\nDorothy Parker--\nSAM\nYou like her?\nJOSIE\nI love the way she writes.\nSAM\nNot the happiest of souls.\n(reading out of book)\n\"Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop.\"\nJOSIE\nBut I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?\nSAM\nTrue. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.\n(then)\nAre you sure you're seventeen?\nJOSIE\nSure, why?\nSAM\nBecause seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.\nJOSIE\nWell, I'm definitely seventeen and\n(off clock)\nnow definitely late--\nAnd she smiles and runs out.\nINTERIOR. ALDYS' CAR - NIGHT\nAldys drives, Josie has shotgun and TYKE, Aldys' nine-year-old sister, is in back. They all hold double-scooped cones and they all sing FREE TO BE YOU AND ME at full voice.\nTYKE\nSee, aren't you guys glad you took a break from that Denominator stuff. I mean, you shouldn't be spending your Saturday night studying the whole time.\nALDYS\nwe should be spending it thinking of how we can better serve your baby-sitting needs?\nTYKE\nThey pull up at a red light, next to an abandoned drive-in. Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. She opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better look.\nJOSIE\nWhat's that?\nALDYS\nThat's the old drive-in. They call it \"The Court\". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.\nANGLE ON: Gibby and Kristen talking by a car.\nALDYS:\n (cont'd)\nSometimes I wonder what they talk about.\nJOSIE\nYeah, I know.\nALDYS\nI mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?\nANGLE ON: THE COOL GIRLS.\nGIBBY\nNo. It's lather, rinse, repeat.\nANGLE BACK ON: ALDYS AND JOSIE\nSuddenly, Guy pokes his head in, startling everyone.\nGUY\nWow, if it isn't Alpo. Coming out to sniff some hydrants?\nJosie is frozen, but not Aldys.\nALDYS\nOh, Guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that's all the time.\nTyke gets it, and laughs. Guy doesn't get it at all.\nGUY\nYou guys aren't seriously trying to hang out at The Court?\nALDYS\noooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan. Where do I sign up?\nGUY\nAnd stay away from prom.\nALDYS\nLast I checked--this was still a free country.\nTYKE\n(singing)\nThere's a land that I see, where the children are free-\nGuy's right in Aldys' face, leaning over Josie. Aldys starts to drive away. Guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside the car.\nGUY\nLook, geek, why don't you just go home and play with your calculator. Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool.\nGuy stops running, and the car continues down the street.\nINTERIOR. CAR \u0096 CONTINUOUS\nAldys seems a little shaken, Tyke continues singing.\nJOSIE\nHave you ever wanted to go to The Court?\nALDYS\nAre you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.\nJOSIE\nIt is?\nALDYS\nYes, it's lame.\nJOSIE\nYeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?\nALDYS\nExactly.\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - DAY\nCLOSE ON a newspaper headline: \"THE COURT - SITE FOR PARTIES, DRUGS AND WEEKEND ARRESTS\" - as Gus throws the newspaper down on his desk.\nJosie sits across the desk from him. She reads the headline, looking very surprised.\nGUS\nJosie, I am appalled.\nJosie picks up the paper, and starts reading intently.\nJOSIE\nJeez, so am I. I had no idea that these kids- let's see- turn to A14-\nShe tries to turn to A14, but Gus grabs the paper out of her hands in a rage.\nGUS\n(trying to keep his cool)\nNo, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.\nJOSIE\nOh. Right.\nGus angrily tries to fold the paper back 'up. He's having a hard time. Josie tries to help, but he yanks it away. Gus reads aloud from the newspaper.\nGUS\nResponding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call \"The Court.\" Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, \"Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night.\"\nJOSIE\n(disbelieving)\nKristen got a quote?\nGus looks up at Josie.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nYes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.\nGUS\nHave you been there?\nJOSIE\nUhh, no.\nGUS\nHave you been to any parties?\nJOSIE\nWell, how would you define to parties\"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--\nGus looks like he may combust. He opens the newspaper, finds what he's looking for, and shoves it in Josie's face. It is a picture of all of the popular kids at Southglen- Kristen, Kirsten, Gibby, Guy- they are all posing for the picture at The Court, smiling and holding beers.\nGUS\nThis is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!\nJOSIE\nGus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.\nHe points to the picture in the paper of the Popular Kids.\nGUS\nDo you even know these kids?\nJOSIE\n(trying)\nThey hid my car--\nGus leans in very close.\nGUS\nGet to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.\nJOSIE\n(very small)\nDepend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.\nGUS\nOUT!\nJosie grabs her knapsack and does.\nINTERIOR. ANITA'S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS\nJosie runs through the bullpen, past Anita's cubicle. ROGER from op/ed enters. He and Anita smile flirtatiously.\nANITA\nHi Roger from op/ed--\nROGER\nHi Anita from classifieds. We still on for tonight?\nANITA\nof course--\nAnd he leans in and kisses her. She pulls away, confused. A beat. Anita kisses him again. Nothing.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\n(can't believe she's saying it--)\nY'know what? No, I don't think we are on. I think I have to stay home.\n(liking how it sounds)\nYeah. I'm staying home! I don't know what I'll do there, but I'm gonna do it. Alone!\nRoger walks off.\nROGER\n(under)\nFreak.\nEXTERIOR. JOSIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT\nRob opens the door still dressed in his Tiki Post outfit. He takes one look at Josie and knows that things are not good.\nJOSIE\nAre mom and dad here?\nROB\nNo. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.\nJOSIE\nGood.\nShe shoves her way into the house. Rob follows.\nINTERIOR. DEN - CONTINUOUS\nJosie storms into the den, and plants herself on the sofa. She sees that Rob has been watching baseball on T.V., and she turns it off.\nJOSIE\nI can't do it. I thought I could. I can't. I give up--I'm never going to be a reporter.\nRob sits next to her on the couch. He looks up at the T.V.-, which is now off.\nROB\nDid you catch the score?\nJosie gives him a look of death.\nROB\nNo, I mean, no big whoop.\nJOSIE\nI can't do this.\nShe pulls the article out of her purse, and shoves it at Rob. He sees the picture of all the popular kids at The Court.\nROB\nThese girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!\nJOSIE\nGus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.\nROB\nWhy is that impossible?\nJosie's eyes get teary.\nJOSIE\nRob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.\nROB\nOh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.\nJOSIE\nRob. Please focus.\nHe puts his arm around her.\nROB\nJos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.\nJOSIE\nDon't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?\nROB\nCome on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.\nJOSIE\nIs that true?\nROB\nLittle known fact.\nJosie takes this in.\nROB\n (cont'd)\nLook, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?\nJOSIE\nYes, desperately.\nROB\nPlus, if you quit you're no better than me.\nJOSIE\nBetter than I...\nROB\nThat's the spirit!\nEXTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NEXT MORNING\nJosie approaches the school. She's clearly made a new attempt at style- she's teetering on too-high platform shoes and showing a blending white midriff. No one pays much attention to her.\nGEORGE, thirty-something African-American, the epitome of cool, waves Josie over to an open van side door. Josie looks confused and scurries to the van.\nJOSIE\n(sotto)\nGeorge! What are you doing here?\nGEORGE\nJust get in the van, Josie.\nINTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - MOMENTS LATER\nHigh-tech surveillance wonderland meets seventies living room. Tape players and monitors share space with shag carpeting and a mini-fridge. Barry White PLAYS on a TAPE. George starts to wrap wire around Josie's waist. He pins a kid's plastic \"captain's wings\" onto her collar.\nJOSIE\nWhat is this?\nGEORGE\nHidden camera.\nJOSIE\nWings?\nGEORGE\nWe used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--\"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?\"\nJOSIE\nI'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.\nGUS (O.S)\n(through speaker)\nGeller, stop being a pain in the ass.\nJosie looks all around.\nJOSIE\nGus?\nGUS (O.S.)\nNo, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.\nJOSIE\nWhat if I say no?\nGUS (O.S.)\nI bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.\nOff Josie's look of concern...\nEXTERIOR. SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER\nA crush of kids flood up the stairs to the front door of the school. We see Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby walking three abreast ahead of Josie up the stairs. The Crowd parts around them. Josie heads towards them.\nJOSIE\nHey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby-- What's up girlfriends?\nThe three girls pause and turn just as Josie, caught up in the moment, doesn't see a stray backpack on the stairs in front of her. Josie trips and--\nJOSIE-CAM POV:\nThe CAMERA FACE-PLANTS into the pavement.\nINTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - SAME\nGeorge watches the monitor, winces.\nJOSIE-CAM POV:\nThe CAMERA still faces the pavement.\nJOSIE\n (O.S.)\n(small)\nI'm okay.\nINTERIOR. COULSOM'S CLASSROOM - LATER\nJosie is standing, reading from her paper. Sam is rapt.\nJOSIE\nAnd so it is Rosalind, in disguise, who is best able to see through the disguises of others. To say to Phebe, \"Mistress, know thy self,\" to look at love from every angle, and to realize, finally, that she is in love with Orlando--\nThe BELL RINGS. Class is over. Josie puts her stuff away and starts to follow the Cool Girls out.\nJOSIE\nHey guys, wait up--\nThe Girls keep moving. Sam stops Josie.\nSAM\nHey, Josie, hold on.\n(then)\nYou've been hiding something from me.\nJOSIE\nOh I don't think so.\nSAM\nYour writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.\nJOSIE\nThank you.\nSAM\nSo what are you thinking for college?\nJOSIE\nCollege. Haven't really thought about it.\nSAM\nThat's crazy. I'll get you some applications.\nJOSIE\nOh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.\n(beat)\nWe just go right into sheep herding.\nSAM\nJosie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.\nJOSIE\nThanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.\nSAM\nJosie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--\n(touching heart)\nin here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon\"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. \"That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--\"\nSAM/JOSIE\nIt --and swallow whole.\"\nThey both take a breath in. Look away from each other.\nINTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN \u0096 SAME\nGeorge watches the monitor.\nGEORGE\nUh oh.\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON\nAnita sits on Gus's desk, watches the last scene on Gus's TV, engrossed. Gus walks in and stops the tape.\nGUS\nShowtime's over! Move-it! Back to work!\nAnita climbs off his desk.\nANITA\nGus, have you ever been in love?\nGUS\nLeave.\nANITA\nOh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.\nGUS\nLove. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.\nANITA\nYou should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.\nGus stares down at his tie. But he's smiling--a little.\nGUS\nGo away. I have enough work here to last me all night.\nANITA\nListen, I don't have any plans--you want some help?\nGUS\nNo Roger from op/ed?\nANITA\nNope.\nThey share a smile.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY \u0096 DAY\nJosie walks toward her locker, the Make out Couple is at it again. Josie's fed up. She taps the Boy on his shoulder.\nJOSIE\nExcuse me. Hi. Do you guys have some kind of schedule I could work around?\nHe ignores Josie and goes back to his Girlfriend.\nAldys, in her Denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins, approaches Josie.\nALDYS\nHey, where's your sweatshirt?\nJOSIE\nI \u0096 uhh, must have forgotten-\nALDYS\nNo biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.\nShe starts to leave.\nALDYS\nOh \u0096 I almost forgot \u0096 I'll see you tonight at Big Cup. 7:30, right?\nJosie looks confused.\nALDYS\nRemember, that poet that we liked \u0096 the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.\nJOSIE\nRight. 7:30.\nALDYS\nI'm late for lab.\nAldys takes off. Josie looks down the hall, where Guy, Kristen and the others are all looking at a flyer pasted to the wall.\nGUY\nThat is gonna be such a sweet show. I am so there.\nGuy looks at Tommy and Jason, who f follow his lead.\nTOMMY\nOh, yeah, man, I'll drive.\nJASON\nIt's gonna be Rufalicious.\nGUY\n(beat)\nYou're using it wrong.\nThey head off, en masse. Josie goes and looks at the flyer: \"JIMMY CLIFF TONIGHT AT DELLOSER HALL\". Josie smiles.\nEXTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - NIGHT\nMarquee reads \"Jimmy Cliff.\" A crowd has gathered by the door. Josie gets out of cab, and walks towards the club.\nINTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - NIGHT\nJosie enters the small, smoky club. She wears what she considers to be her \"hip concert outfit,\" an outfit that completely clashes with the Rasta wear of the other concert goers. -She reaches the BOUNCER.\nBOUNCER\nYou Drinking?\nJosie notices the two Stoners from school standing behind her in line.\nJOSIE\nI am not 21. I am only seventeen and I still attend high school.\nThe bouncer stamps her hand. She looks down at her hand.\nWE CU ON her hand, reading DELLOSER.\nShe enters as the two Stoners approach the Bouncer.\nBOUNCER\nTwo of you?\nA beat as the Stoners look at each other, realizing...\nSTONER 1\n(to Stoner 2)\nOh, Dude--\nAnd they run out of the club.\nINTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - SAME\nJIIAMY CLIFF is playing. The crowd sits at tables, grooving. Josie approaches the bar. A guy turns around--it's Sam.\nSAM\nJosie--out on a school night.\nA woman, LARA, emerges from the crowd. And puts her arm around SAM. An awkward beat.\nLARA\nHi.\nJOSIE\nHi.\nSAM\nOh, right, sorry. Lara--Josie. Josie--Lara.\n(to Lara)\nJosie's a student of mine.\n(to Josie)\nLara's my-date.\nLARA\nNice to meet you.\nAnother awkward pause.\nLARA\nC'mon, c'mon, let's go dance.\nThe crowd roars over Cliff's next song as Lara drags San off into the crowd. Sam looks back briefly at Josie as we lose him into the crowd.\nANGLE ON JOSIE\nShe sees Guy's group sitting at a table and approaches an empty seat. They immediately scoot around so that the seat is taken. Undeterred, Josie sees a seat at the next table and sits down in it. She looks up to see that she is at a table of huge RASTAFARIANS. They all wear big Rasta hats and even bigger hair and are smoking a joint the size of Cuba. She smiles awkwardly.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nHi. Is it okay if I sit here?\nRASTA #1\nOh, ya mon. We accept all peoples. We are all about da' love.\nJosie and the Rasta's start to groove to the music. Josie looks over at Guy's table, sees they are toking off a small joint and passing it around.\nINTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINOUS\nGeorge and his DATE, a Pam Grier look-alike, sit close on the couch, grooving to the CONCERT PLAYING on the monitor and through the various speakers. CU on the monitor.\nJOSIE-CAM POV:\nThe joint the size of Cuba is passed into frame. Josie's hand takes it. Catching sight of this, George and his Date exchange concerned looks.\nSMASH CUT TO:\nINTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - LATER\nJosie is high beyond belief, wearing a big Rasta hat and loudly laughing her ass off as the Rastas just stare. She can hardly keep herself in her chair.\nJOSIE\nGet it?! Get it?! He was a firecracker!\nShe lifts up Rasta 1's dreadlocks to get his ear.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\n(yelling)\nA firecracker!\nAnd she cracks up again.\nRASTA #1\n(to Rasta #2)\nI don't love her.\nRastas share looks ill around. Then Josie hears the first strains of \"The Harder They Come\"--\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nOh my God! This music rules!\nAnd Josie proceeds to get up and take over the place--she's dancing on the table, getting up with the band and playing the bongos, all with absolutely no rhythm or style. But with a lot of whooping. The club is agog.\nANGLE ON: Lara and Sam. They both look aghast.\nLARA\nShe's a student of yours?\nSAM\n(in explanation)\nShe's from Bali.\nAnd as Josie continues to dance on stage, making a total fool of herself, Jimmy Cliff turns to CAMERA.\nJIMMY:\nFreak.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - LATER\nJosie is on the phone, and is in the process of finishing an entire pie.\nJOSIE\nI'm telling you, Rob! I think I did it! I'm totally in! I was soo cool tonight! You'd be so--\n(staring at fork)\nYou know what's a weird word? Fork.\n(then)\nWait! Wait! Did I tell you about my new friends? I made friends with a whole table of Rastafarians! Not one, a whole table!\n(noting empty pie plate, suddenly serious)\nOh. My. God. Someone ate my entire pie.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING\nJosie is asleep where we left her, her head on her hand, empty pie plate nearby.\nShe wakes, picks her head up. Looks down at her hand, the DELLOSER stamp is faint. CLOSE UP ON her forehead. There in block letters backwards is \"LOSER\".\nShe looks up at the clock, which reads: 8:30. She's late. Very late. She grabs her book bag and her keys, and races out.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING\nJosie strides confidently down the hallway, LOSER prominently on her forehead. She sees Guy and his Group.\nJOSIE\nHi Guy. Guys. Guy's Guys.\nThey stare, then snicker.\nGUY\nHi loser.\nThe group laughs and joins in, saying \"Hey Loser.\" Josie's face registers confusion.\nJOSIE-CAM POV:\nWe move slowly down the packed hallway, the camera shifting nervously amidst a sea of laughing kids. The LAUGHTER starts to ECHO.\nJosie starts to walk quickly, then run, through the gauntlet of' laughing and pointing kids.\nINTERIOR.

GUS'S OFFICE - DAY\nA Group is watching Gus's TV, including Bruns\n(the hair plug man)\nand Howard\n(arm casts). They are slack-jawed in shock. WE HEAR O.S. the SOUNDS of Josie VOMITING. Gus shakes his head sadly.\nGUS\nIt's like the All-Humiliation Network.\nThey all nod in agreement.\nINTERIOR. GIRLS' BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER\nJosie is in the fetal position on the floor of a stall.\nINTERIOR. DEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nThe den of Josie's parents' home. Josie is decked out. She's wearing a pretty hideous metallic pink dress, matching gloves, bag, shoes. She's shining her braces, using the T.V. screen as a mirror. The PHONE RINGS. Josie grabs it.\nJOSIE\n(into phone)\nHey, Billy. I'm ready. Sure, I can just wait for you on the front porch. See you in a -uhh- jiffer.\nShe hangs up. Sixteen year old Rob, very cute and buff, enters. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is on his arm.\nGIRLFRIEND\n(mouthing to Rob)\nJiffer?\nRob just shrugs.\nEXTERIOR. JOSIE'S FRONT PORCH NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nJosie, in all her prom splendor, waits out on the front porch for her date.\nShe sees a LONG, BLACK LIMO turn the corner, headed for the house. She's hopping up and down with excitement. She checks her reflection in her compact, and then watches the limo approach.\nThe sunroof of the limo opens and Billy Prince, the Adonis of the suburbs, stands up, sticking out of the sunroof. He waves. Josie smiles and waves back.\nThen, another figure joins Billy's. It's a GORGEOUS BLONDE in a slinky dress. She's standing up, sticking out of the sunroof as well. Josie looks a bit confused, but still tries to smile. Then, she sees them holding things. LITTLE THINGS. LITTLE WHITE THINGS.\nBefore Josie realizes what's going on, her metallic ensemble is covered in dripping, oozing eggs. One whacks her right in her trifocals.\nBILLY\n(shouting)\nHey, write a poem about this!\nBilly and his date lob a few more eggs, and their limo roars off. Josie stands on the porch, alone. She's got egg in her hair, on her face, all over her dress- everywhere. She starts to cry. Softly at first, moving into big, loud, wet sobs. She sits down on the porch, her head in her hands, and just keeps crying.\nDISSOLVE BACK TO\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - (PRESENT) - DAY\nHomeroom has just gotten out, and the halls are packed with kids. Josie is running full speed, trying to negotiate around lots of kids, in her frantic-race for the door. Kids still point and stare.\nShe bangs into some freshmen, gets whacked by a book bag, slides some banners that kids are painting - but she won't slow down.\nJust as she's almost at the doors to the school, the BIG WOODEN DOOR to the front office opens. Josie can't stop. A figure emerges, but before Josie can even see who it is, she slams into it and goes down. She bangs her head on the hard linoleum floor.\nINTERIOR.

You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.\nSMASH CUT TO:\nINTERIOR. CAFETERIA - LATER\nJosie emerges from the cafeteria line with her tray. A LOUD CHANT comes from one of the tables.\nCROWD\nROB, ROB, ROB\nShe turns to see Rob in the middle of a hot dog eating contest with a HUGE WRESTLER. Rob downs his last one, raises his hands in victory. The CROWD goes WILD. Rob sits down at Guy's table.\nJOSIE\nOh my god.\nANGLE ON GUY'S TABLE\nGUY\nDude, you rock!\nHe high-fives Rob.

BASEBALL DIAMOND - SAME\nThe team is practicing. Rob has just hit a home run with three men on. EVERYONE CHEERS him on as he runs the bases.\nAs he comes into home, he is met with congrats, high fives. Everyone loves him.\nJosie watches the whole scene, seething with jealousy.\nINTERIOR. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - LATER\nJosie, post-shower, is wrapped in a towel and carrying her sweaty gym clothes. A group of GIRLS walk by her, giggling as they exit. She approaches her locker and finds it ajar and completely empty. She looks from the empty locker down to the sweaty clothes in her hand. A realization sweeps over her face.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\nJosie shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym clothes. She is clearly beaten. She looks down the hall, stunned.\nIt is ridiculous Rob is being followed by a posse, everyone knows his name. Girls tug on his shirt, guys slap him on the back or high-five him.\nJASON\nHey, Rob.\nTOMMY\nRobster, what's up?\nBRETT\nThe Rob man. My man Rob.\nGIBBY\nHey, Robbie.\nKRISTEN\nHi there Robbie Rob.\nJosie sees Guy approach Rob, and shake his hand.\nGUY\nHey Robo- how's it going?\nROB\nNice pants, man. They are rufus.\nGuy smiles.

CARNIVAL MIDWAY - SAME\nAldys and the Denominators stand in front of a booth that displays a large glass jar of jellybeans. Calculators and paper out, they're engrossed in find the answer.\nJosie walks by alone. The Denominators don't notice her.\nEXTERIOR. THE FERRIS WHEEL - SAME\nWE PAN DOWN the line of KIDS waiting to ride the Ferris wheel. In front are Tommy, Jason, Gibby and Kirsten.\nKIRSTEN\nThis has been so much fun! We've been first in line for every ride!\nTOMMY\nThat's cuz we cut every line.\nWE PAN DOWN to the end of the line, where we find Josie, standing alone. She's trying her best to keep her game face on. The CARNY opens the gate, the Kids pile onto the ride, two by two. Josie reaches an empty car--the last one--and gets in. The Carny holds the safety bar open.\nCARNY\nWhere's your partner?\nJOSIE\nI don't--I don't have one--\nCARNY\n(yelling loudly)\nI GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN!\n(to Crowd)\nSINGLE!\nJOSIE\nDo you have to yell like that?\nSam, standing by a vendor, looks over and notices Josie's predicament.\nTOMMY (O.S.)\nOf course it's Loser that's holding up the ride!\nSam walks up to the Josie's bucket.\nSAM\nThis seat taken?\nJOSIE\n(relieved)\nThank you.\nHe gets in. The ride JERKS into motion.\nSAM\n(nervous)\nWhoa.\nThey start a slow ascent. Sam seems ill at ease.\nJOSIE\nAre you--scared?\nSAM\nI'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.\nJOSIE\nYou're afraid of the Ferris wheel.\nSAM\nActually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.\nJOSIE\nOh right. The Spiderman incident.\nSAM\n(touched)\nYou remember that story?\nJOSIE\nOf course. I remember everything from your class.\nThey smile at each other. The smile is interrupted by a HEAVY SWAYING of their bucket, caused by Tommy ROCKING in the bucket ahead. Sam looks a little green.\nSAM\nYoooooow.\nJOSIE\nDon't look down!\nThey're facing the ground at this point.\nSAM\nOut of my control.\n(yelling to Tommy)\nTOMMY! CUT IT OUT! ENOUGH!\nTommy stops. Sam turns to Josie.\nSAM\n (cont'd)\n(defensive)\nI said that as a chaperone.\nThey start to ascend again. Sam relaxes.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nOkay This is okay. Smooth.\n(then)\nCan I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?\nJOSIE\nThat's what makes you interesting.\n(beat, recovering)\nAs a teacher.\nSAM\nGod, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.\nJOSIE\nYou do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.\nSAM\nYou have to say that. You're my student.\nJOSIE\nI don't have to say that.\nThey look into each other's eyes just as Tommy RATTLES his bucket ruthlessly.\nTOMMY\n (O.S.)\nIF THE BUCKET'S A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME-A KNOCKIN'.\nJosie and Sam laugh uncomfortably.\nSAM\nBoys.\nJOSIE\nI know.\nSAM\nI'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.\nJOSIE\nWhy do you do that?\nSAM\nI don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.\n(beat)\nYou know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.\nJOSIE\nThat's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--\nThe bucket is rocked again by Tommy--Sam grips the safety bar.\nSAM\n(as he rocks)\nSame here.\nThey stop rocking but they're still stuck at the top.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nAll I can tell you is that when you're my age, the guys will be lined up around the block for you.\nThey share a smile.\nJOSIE\n(suddenly shy)\nYou have to say that. You're my teacher.\nSAM\nI shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.\nThey look at each other, their smiles fading into realization. Suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out of their reverie. They smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh.\nWIDE SHOT of the Ferris wheel as Josie and Sam descend.\nSAM (V.O.)\nThanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nWhen are you going to open your eyes?\nSAM (V.O.)\nI'm thinking when I'm home.\nEXTERIOR. BASEBALL DUGOUT - DAY\nRob sits with a bunch of BASEBALL PLAYERS. MATZ and PACKER, the studs of the team, come into the dugout and join them.\nPACKER: Hey Rob, thanks for showing me that new grip. It totally changed my swing.\nROB\nNo problem, man.\nThey do one of those elaborate, fraternity-like handshakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Rob sees Josie walking alone across the field. He gets an idea.\nROB\nHey, you guys know that girl, Josie Geller?\nMATZ\nYou mean \"Loser\"?\nROB\nNo, dude, Josie. We used to go out and she dumped me. But we're still good friends. And she is\u0085 amazing, if you know what I mean.\nThe guys are all stunned.\nINTERIOR. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - DAY\nGibby stands staring at a skeleton with Rob and the Cool Girls.\nGIBBY\nAll right--that's it. Just water and Ex-Lax till prom.\nROB\nHey--Josie's Dad invented that stuff.

TRACK - DAY\nRob stands behind the bleachers with Tommy, Jason, and Guy.\nTOMMY\nNo way.\nJASON\nShe used to date the drummer for The Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?\nGUY\nNo way.

CAFETERIA - DAY\nJosie turns with her tray after paying. Aldys sees her.\nALDYS\nHey, Josie--I'm really sorry I snapped at you. Do you wanna--\nJosie sees Rob waving her over to \"the table\" where Kristen, Gibby and the gang sit.\nJOSIE\nOh, Aldys, y'know, I have to--\nAnd Josie walks over to Guy's table, leaving Aldys staring after her. Josie sits down at the table. Everyone stares at her.\nGIBBY\nHey Josie. It's Josie, right?\nKRISTEN\nCan I just say--I totally love Ex-Lax.\nJOSIE\n(confused)\nOkay, that's good to know--\nTOMMY\nI can't believe you dated Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.\nJosie shoots a look at Rob.\nROB\nHey, I told you--Josie doesn't like to talk about that.\nKIRSTEN\nYeah, Tommy, that's totally gochay.\nGIBBY\nI think it's pronounced gauche.\nJOSIE\nYeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.\nA silent beat. Josie thinks she may have blown it.\nGIBBY\nDuh, of course you would know that. From being on your yacht in the south of France.\nThey all smile at her. Josie soaks in her newfound popularity.\nINTERIOR. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY\nOn the walls are SAFE SEX posters. On the front desk, pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space with plastic biology cross-section models of male and female reproductive organs.\nSam stands in front of his English class, impatiently looking at his watch. Josie looks up from her desk, sees Anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door. Josie's eyes widen, she starts to make \"get out of here\" movements. Sam notices Josie and follows her gaze to Anita. He opens the door, speaks sotto to Anita.\nSAM\nHi. You're here for the sex talk?\nANITA\n(happily taken aback)\nWell. I like a man who gets to the point.\nSAM\nYou're Pam?\nANITA\n(frisky)\nIf you say so.\nSam turns to the class.\nSAM\nWelcome juniors and seniors, this is Pam Kitterman. She's our district health counselor. She's here to lead our sex discussion.\nHe ushers a surprised Anita to the front of the room. Josie reacts.\nANITA\nI am? Oh, I am. Hi. Okay. Sex. Yes, well, sex. What's to say really, y'know? You like a guy, you do it. Sometimes he calls. Sometimes he doesn't.\nAnita leans into Josie, talks sotto.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\n(whispering)\nHi!\nJOSIE\n(also whispering)\nWhat are you doing here?!\nANITA\nI had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!\n(then normal voice to Josie). Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.\n(looking at watch)\nOh look. Class is over already.\nSAM\nI thought this was a 45-minute seminar.\nANITA\nRight. Right.\nAnita walks back to the front of the classroom.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\nOkay, sex. Let's see. Sex is really fun.\n(off Josie's look)\nWhen you're old enough. Which none of you are, trust me I should know cuz when you lose it to some guy named Junior with really bad breath in the back of a van at a Guns and Roses concert you're gonna wish you listened to your Mom when she said, y'know, no one's gonna want to buy the whole friggin ice cream truck when you're handing out the popsicles for free.\nThere's a deafening silence. The kids are amazed.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\nOkay. Any questions?\nINTERIOR. SCIENCE CLASSROON - LATER\nThe Kids all have bananas and condoms. They are in various stages of putting the condom over the banana. Anita walks among them, clearly more comfortable with her role now.\nANITA\nOkay. I know it's hard.\nTitters from the group.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\nDifficult. But safe sex is really important. I try to practice it every day.\nJosie reacts.\nANGLE ON KIRSTEN & KRISTEN. Their condoms are snugly on their bananas. They stare at Josie.\nKRISTEN\nwait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.\nGIBBY\nSometimes opposites attract.\nKIRSTEN\nYeah. Look at Bert and Ernie.\nWE ANGLE ON ANITA. She's walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front.\nANITA\nSo just..imagine the bananas are the real thing.\nShe takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at it. She snorts.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\nIn a land called \"every man's fantasy\".\nShe looks up, sees the real MISS KITTERMAN\n(we can tell from the model of a uterus she carries), standing outside the door and waving. Without missing a beat, Anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it.\nANGLE ON: JOSIE AND TRACY still struggling with condoms.\nTRACY\nGod, I can't do this.\nJOSIE\nMaybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.\nTRACY\nYou know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.\nJOSIE\nWow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.\nANGLE ON SAM, listening. Josie is oblivious.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nYou know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.\nTRACY\nBut I'm not a penguin.\nSAM\nIt's an analogy.\nA surprised Josie looks up to see Sam next to her. She lets her condom go. And it flies off her banana into his face. Josie turns to Tracy.\nJOSIE\nExcuse me. I have to go die now.\nThe class is interrupted by Sydney over the loudspeaker:\nSYDNEY (O.S.)\n(over speaker)\nHey guys--Sydney again! Don't forget--No going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. And about prom\u0097\nEveryone freezes. Dead silence.\nSYDNEY (cont'd)\nReally bad news. We just got the word from intelligence-- Northglen High is doing the Millennium too!\nComplete chaos. SCREAMING terror. A GIRL faints. Sera squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. Other KIDS are beating their bananas against desktops. Brett, the football player, absentmindedly peels his banana and begins eating it.\nSAM\nAll right guys, let's calm down. Calm down.\n(no response)\nSit!\nThey all do, including Anita.\nSAM (cont\u0092d)\nNow look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.\nANITA\nOH! How about \"Under the Sea?\"\nShe's met with a round of \"boos\". Anita reacts.\nANITA (cont\u0092d)\nWell excuse me.\nSAM\nWhat about the \"Roaring Twenties\"\u0085 or \"The 80's\"?\nThe Class lets out a GIANT GROAN on that one.\nGIBBY\nWhat do you think we are? Amateurs?\nGUY\nJosie.\nSERA\nThat's not a theme.\nGUY\nNo, Josie will have the answer.\nA long beat. Expectant faces all turn to Josie. She looks at Tracy.\nJOSIE\nHow about--'\n(coming to her)\nmeant for each other--Famous couples throughout history?\nAnother beat as the Class considers.\nGUY\n(smiles and nods)\nYeah. That's it.\nThe Class suddenly CONCURS.\nCLASS\nYeah. /That's it. /Rufus.\nJosie soaks in all the approval like a sponge.\nJOSIE\nThanks. Thank you.\nJosie looks from Sam and Anita's smiling faces to find Guy smiling at her.\nCLOSE UP ON A BANNER reading: \"MILLENNIUM\". It comes down, replaced by one that reads: \"MEANT FOR EACH OTHER... WIDEN TO REVEAL:\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\nJosie and the Cool Girls walk under the banner, laughing.

Josie quickly pulls a cardigan off a rack, feigning interest in it. The Girls all do the same.\nINTERIOR.

Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.\nGIBBY\nWannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.\nKRISTEN\nHer dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.\nGIBBY:\n(to Josie)\nWait. Do you know any gay guys?\nJOSIE\nWhy?\nKIRSTEN\nWe'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.\nKRISTEN\nWe're very evolved.\nON THE FIELD\nA BALL sails fast and hard.

Totally Rufus.\nGus and Anita look at each other, both mouthing \"Rufus?\"\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nI have, um--\nJosie dumps out her backpack on the table.

A bicycle license plate that says-\"JOSIE\" is nailed to the door. She stands in front of it.\nJOSIE\nMaybe we should go in a different room?\nGUY\nI already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.\nGuy reaches for the doorknob.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S OLD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nThey go in. Josie sees her spelling bee trophies- with her name. She turns them around, trying to appear nonchalant. As Guy enters, he eyes the trophies, the stuffed animals, the many sets of encyclopedias.\nGUY\nWow, Rob's sister must be such a loser.\nJosie manages a weak smile. Guy sits on the bed.\nGUY\nCome here, sit down.\nShe sits on the bed, and then sees a picture of her and her family on the bedside table. She dives across the bed to overturn it.\nGUY\nI'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-\nJOSIE\nYes. I'll go. Yes.\nGuy leans in as if to kiss her and whispers...\nGUY\nRufus.\n(then pulling away)\nBut I don't even know where you live.\nJOSIE\nYou know what? Why don't you just pick me up here?

Betty was so spunky and fun. Veronica may have had great legs, but she was too moody. Very high maintenance.\nJosie laughs.\nANGLE ON: A TABLE where Kristen and Tommy are selling prom tickets. Aldys is standing in front of them.\nALDYS\nYou can't not sell me a ticket to prom.\nTOMMY\nListen, Alpo--we can do whatever we want.\nALDYS\nOh, I get it.

I like your \"can do\" attitude.\nJOSIE\n(shyly)\nThanks.\n(beat)\nThey weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?\nSAM\nMaybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.\nJOSIE\nBut Humpty Dumpty was alone.\nSAM\nThat's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.\nJOSIE\nThat's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--\nSAM\nYeah. To watch the world go by.--\nJOSIE\nTo put us back together again when we fall.\nThey share a meaningful glance and a smile.\nSAM\nOur penguin, right?\nJOSIE\nDo you think you'll find her?\nSAM\nYeah, actually I do.\nThey are lost in each other.

Okay, he's a little interested too.\nANITA\nThis is the most beautiful prom I have ever been to.\nCynthia runs in with a bowl of popcorn.\nCYNTHIA\nDid I miss the crowning?\nMERKIN\nNo, but I'm closing the pool in five minutes.\nMerkin holds out a bowl of cash.\nMERKIN\n (cont'd)\nJosie's odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of the night.\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS\nWE PAN ACROSS the dance floor where we see POPEYE & OLIVE OYL, SONNY & CHER, the BLUES BROTHERS.\nWE HOLD on ROBIN dancing with BATGIRL. BATMAN approached and taps Robin's shoulder--\nBATMAN\nMay I have this dance-\nAnd Batgirl steps aside--Robin and Batman dance happily away.\nANGLE ON ROB trying to slow dance with Tracy\n(dressed like REBECCA De MORNAY), but she is so-drunk she's having trouble balancing.\nTRACY\nAre you having fun?\nROB\nYeah. Definitely.\nHe tries to stand her up on her own.\nTRACY\nGood. Gibby gave me champagne.\nROB\nMaybe we should sit.\nHe helps her to a chair next to the dance floor. They both sit. Next to them, a ravenous MISS PIGGY eats with her date KERMIT looking on. She picks up an hors d'oeuvre and stares at it horrified.\nMISS PIGGY\nOh my God! Is this a pig in a blanket?!\nTracy looks at Rob, and gets serious.\nTRACY\nRob, I've - I've thought about it a lot. And I think- I mean, I know. You're the one. My penguin.\nRob looks at her. She's young. She's beautiful. She's tipsy. She's trying to put her legs behind her head.\nROB\nWow - I-\nTRACY\nRob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.\nHe looks around. It's high school prom. A skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner. Other kids are sneaking smokes. He can't do this.\nROB\nI'm gonna get you some water. And then, I think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie.\nRob gets up, kisses Tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment table. Tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into Kermit's lap. Kermit looks down, surprised and interested. Miss Piggy notices, gives him a big \"Harumph\", tosses her hair, and leaves.\nANGLE BACK ON: THE COOL TABLE.\nGibby is staring O.S. in horror.\nGIBBY\nYou guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?\nKRISTEN\nThat you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?\n(beat)\nDid I say that out loud?\nWE FOLLOW Kristen's stare to the prom entrance where Aldys and the Denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. They cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their unwieldy, tied-together conga line. They approach the Cool Table.\nGIBBY\nSo what are you supposed to be? Other than freaks?\nALDYS\nWe're DNA. A double helix. But I guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio.\nKristen reaches out and touches the rope binding Denominator #1 to Aldys. Denominator #1 slaps her hand away.\nDENOMINATOR #1\nPlease don't touch the hydrogen. It's rented.\nKristen reacts.\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ON THE STAGE \u0096 LATER\nSam takes the stage, with a card in his hand.\nSAM\nWell, the moment has arrived.\nHe looks at the card.\nSAM\nOur 1999 prom court - the princesses are - Miss Kristen Rey, Miss Kirsten Leosis and Miss Gibby Zarefsky. And the princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob -\nSam looks at the card, and then looks around. Nobody can help him.\nSAM\nMr. Rob ... Mr. Rob!\nThe crowd cheers. Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen all jump in preplanned delight. Rob seems genuinely surprised. Jason carries Tommy up to the stage piggyback. The girls make their way to the stage, and put on their \"PROM COURT\" sashes. Sam looks to the card again.\nSAM\nNext up - Southglen's Prom King\u0085\nGuy is already halfway to the stage-\nSAM\nGuy Perkins!\nThe crowd goes wild. Guy reaches the stage and takes his crown and scepter.\nSAM\nAnd - this year's prom queen -\nSam looks at the card, then at Josie. Josie is standing; eyes open, staring at the podium...\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nThe Crowd is rapt, waiting for the announcement. Anita has her eyes squeezed shut, praying for the win...\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ANGLE ON SAM.\nSAM\nLadies and gentlemen \u0096 Josie Geller!\nThe Crowd CHEERS like crazy, Josie smiles.\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nThe Crowd goes crazy, hugging each other and jumping up and down.\nANITA\nYes! You go girl! Yes! Yes!\nAnita gives Gus a big hug. Gus is completely taken aback. Merkin dolefully hands out money.\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS-\nJosie is hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, elated, to the stage. Sam places the Queen's tiara on her head and hands her a bouquet of flowers. They lock eyes for a moment.\nSAM\nAnd now - as it is custom - the king and queen will have their first dance.\nON THE DANCE FLOOR:\nGuy and Josie begin to dance. From Josie's P.O.V., it's in SLOW MOTION, the world glittering and wonderful around her.\nGUY\nHey--what are you thinking about?\nJOSIE\nShakespeare. How he described a night like this--\"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold\".\n(beat)\nWhat about you? What are you thinking about?\nGUY\n(taking a beat, happily)\nMy sword.\nIt's like a switch has been flicked on in Josie's brain.\nJOSIE\nOh.\nGUY\nJosie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.\nJOSIE\nYou said that already.\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - BUFFET - MINUTES LATER\nJosie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face with Sam. They're both taken aback by the other's beauty.\nSAM\nJosie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.\nJOSIE\nThanks. So do you.\nThey both laugh, embarrassed, at Josie's flub.\nSAM\nI always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something.\nAn awkward beat.\nSAM\n (cont'd)\nYou wanna--\nHe gestures towards the dance floor. Josie smiles.\nJOSIE\nYeah, okay--\nAnd they walk off onto the dance floor.\nANGLE ON: THE SIDE OF THE DANCE FLOOR.\nGuy approaches Aldys.\nGUY\nHey, listen--it's prom. How about we let all the old shit go. Would you like to dance?\nAldys can't help it. She smiles, a little flattered.\nGUY\n (cont'd)\nIf it's okay with the rest of the double helix.\nAldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group. And starts to dance with Guy.\nANGLE ON: JOSIE AND SAM as they continue to dance.\nSAM\nProms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.\nJOSIE\nWell, are you here with anybody?\nSAM\nNo, I'm alone.\nJOSIE\nIt's weird because \"prom\" is actually from the word \"promenade\". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?\nSam smiles at this.\nSAM\nYou're amazing, Josie Geller.\nANGLE ON: GUY AND ALDYS as they dance, WE SEE the Cool Girls and Jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing Gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a CAN OF ALPO. She hands it to Jason who pulls a CAN OPENER out of his pocket, opens the lid. He hands it to Kirsten who take the lid off. She hands the can to Kristen, who hands the can to Tommy.\nSAM\nSo--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?\nJOSIE\nYeah, I have.\nCLOSE UP on Josie's HAND as she subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nThere's something I have to tell you--\nHer foot comes down on top of it.\nINTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS\nGeorge is making out with his Date when the monitor suddenly FRITZES OFF. George looks up.\nGEORGE\nWhat the--?!\nGeorge stands and hits the side of the monitor.\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nGus's monitor flicks to static. The Crowd lets out a horrified GASP.\nCYNTHIA\nTell him what?! Tell him what?!\nINTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\nSam looks deep into Josie's eyes.\nSAM\nThere's something I have to tell you, too--\nJosie's eyes shift from Sam to over his shoulder. She spots Aldys, who smiles at her. Josie's eyes travel up to the can of DOG FOOD.\nFLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE\non the porch, facing Billy and his Date.\nFLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE\nwith egg dripping all over her.\nBACK TO PRESENT.\nJOSIE\nNOOOOOOO!\nSLOW MOTION as Josie lunges for Aldys and pulls her to floor as Tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down Guy's front. The Crowd stops dead, staring. The can, now empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise ECHOING in the silence.\nGUY\n(to Josie)\nWhat is your problem?!\nGIBBY\nI knew it. You are a loser.\nKRISTEN\nYou ruined the whole thing!\nKIRSTEN\nYou so do not deserve to be prom queen.\nEveryone is still staring. It's dead quiet.\nJOSIE\nLet me tell you something.\nIt is still silent. Josie takes a deep breath, and looks around the room.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nI don't care about being the prom queen. I am twenty five years old.\nLooks of confusion and teenage disgust. Rob is pissed. Sam looks shocked.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nI'm here as an undercover reporter for the Sun Times for God's sake and I've been beating my brains out trying to impress you.\nShe tears off her crown, and chucks it. She's on a roll.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nI want to tell you something. You people- Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss out on so much.\n(indicating Aldys)\nWhy her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my friends only after my brother, Rob...\nShe points out Rob in the crowd. He's mortified.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nposed as a student and told you to like me. But y'know--l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good.\n(beat)\nBut not as good as being myself.\n(turns to crowd)\nAnd to all of you-- there's a big world out there. Bigger than prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. What matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are-What if Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn't \"cool\"? What if Rosie O'Donnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid? What if Michael Jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?.\n(a beat)\nIn this room right now, there could be a future Nobel Prize winner, a Supreme Court Justice, an amazing Mom. Find out who you are and don't be afraid of it.\n(a beat)\nAnd if you'll all excuse me, I have some business to take care of.\nReaction shots' all around. Kids start clapping, hollering, whooping. The MUSIC STARTS UP again. They all go back to dancing The Denominators lead their own conga line.\nANGLE ON: JOSIE\nShe looks around for Sam but he is gone. She runs out, brushing past the Judges.\nANGLE ON: JUDGES\nJudge #2 dabs his eyes.\nJUDGE #1\nThis prom had it all. Laughter, tears, an amazing climax.\nJudge #2, still overcome, just raises his \"two thumbs up.\"\nEXTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER\nJosie exits the club, looking for Sam. George runs up to her.\nGEORGE\nHey--I lost the feed! What happened with Coulson? Gus is going crazy!\nOut of the shadows emerges Sam. The look on his face says he just heard everything.\nJOSIE\nSo--surprise!\nHe shakes his head in disbelief and walks off. Josie chases after him. He turns back to her.\nSAM\n\"Surprise!\" you were doing a story on me?!\nJOSIE\nNo, surprise, I thought you'd be--\nSAM\nWhat? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?\nJOSIE\n(touched)\nYou were attracted to me?\nSAM\nGoddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.\nJOSIE\nWait, I was going to tell you--\nSAM\nYou set me up. For a story.\n(beat)\nYou know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.\nJOSIE\nBut now you don't have to--\nSAM\nNow I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!\nJOSIE\nI did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!\nSAM\nThe person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.\nJOSIE\nI don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.\nSam turns and starts to walk away.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nPlease. Please don't walk away.\nSAM\nI just can't look at you the same way.\nSam gets into his car and drives off. Josie is devastated.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATER\nJosie, still in the prom dress, rounds the corner of her apartment hallway and sees Rob, still in his Risky Business get-up, slumped in front of the door.\nROB\nJosie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.\nJOSIE\nReally?\nHe gets up. He's not happy.\nROB\nNo- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.\nJOSIE\nI wasn't even thinking about-\nROB\nNo, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?\nJOSIE\nI-\nROB\nNo, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.\nHe storms off.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT\nJosie lies amidst the needlepoint pillows, still in her prom costume. She stares blankly at the ceiling.\nINTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - DAY\nGus slaps a newspaper down on his desk.\nCLOSE ON - the front page of the paper, and not just any newspaper - THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE - the Sun Times' rival.\nThere is a PHOTO of Josie from Prom with the headline that reads: \"REPORTER REVEALED AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL\".\nJosie picks it up, and starts reading.\nGUS\nYour story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.\nJOSIE\nMaybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.\nGUS\nI'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.\nJosie stands. Slams down the paper.\nJOSIE\nWe are not screwed. Yes, I made a mistake. But we will have a story.\n(beat)\nYou will have an amazing story.\nJosie exits.\nINTERIOR. SUN TIMES BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS\nJosie walks out of Gus's office, continues, determined, towards the elevators. Anita falls into step with her.\nANITA\nJosie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?\nJOSIE\nYeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.\nANITA\nYou need my help?\nJOSIE\nNo, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.\nJosie walks past Merkin's desk. She holds out her hand to Merkin.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nMerkin. Highlighter.\nMerkin slaps a highlighter into her hand, she continues on. Anita watches her go.\nEXTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\nJosie, looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase, bounds up the steps, two at a time.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME\nJosie walks down the hall, purposefully - she is on a mission. Groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this time, Josie doesn't even notice.\nAs Josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with Guy, who is at his locker. He looks at her. She smiles. And now it is Guy that is nervous. He drops a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. Josie looks at him - and for the first time we see it register on her face - this guy is just a seventeen- year-old kid.\nGUY\nUh, hey, umm--Ms. Geller. This is totally embarrassing but my mom, she's all worried about me getting a job after graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me, at the Sun Times?\nJosie smiles big.\nJOSIE\nI'll do what I can. And tell your mom not to worry - you'll do O.K.\nJosie continues down the hall.\nINTERIOR. LOCKER ROOM - SAME\nThe guys' locker room. A bunch of GUYS are getting dressed after P. E.\nJOSIE\n (O.S.)\nWOMAN COMING THROUGH! COVER UP WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SEEN!\nAnd with that Josie comes walking into the locker room, completely unruffled, and storms over to Coach Romano's office, just as he is leaving it.\nJOSIE\nHi, Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller, from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the Sun Times, Jim Lakin?\nCOACH\nSure, every coach in the area tries to get Jim to cover his team.\nJosie puts her arm around the coach, and leads him back into his own office.\nJOSIE\nWell, what would you say if I told you that I could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game?\nCOACH\nI'd say you can have whatever the hell you want.\nJosie smiles, together they enter his office and close the door.\nINTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - DAY\nJosie sits at her disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nSomeone once told me that to write well you have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher.\nINTERIOR. GUS' OFFICE - DAY\nGus comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the \"Life and Style\" section.\nAnd there it is. Front page - \"NEVER BEEN KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER.\" There are three pictures next to the article. One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nHigh school was more of the same. Then, at seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke. I have never fully recovered.\nINTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUHCHROOH - DAY\nAnita and Cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch room, over a shared bag of microwave popcorn. They are astounded-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nYes, it is embarrassing to share this with the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I learned it, without sharing this humiliating history.\nEXTERIOR. A HOUSE - MORNING\nThe Sun Times lies on the front mat. The door opens; we see a pair of bare feet. A hand reaches down to grab the paper. WE PAN UP to reveal Sam in all his depressed glory--sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nI received an assignment, my first as a reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst nightmare.\nSam shuts the door.\nEXTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\nKids stream into school.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nWhat I found?\nINTERIOR. MRS. KNOX'S CIASSROOM - DAY\nMrs. Knox, wearing the sombrero, teaches her class.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nThere's still that one teacher, who marches to her own drummer-\nAnd in the back row, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby are laughing an talking--\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nThose girls are still there. The ones that, even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up.\nEXTERIOR. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY\nThe BASEBALL TEAM as they practice-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nThe athletes - and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share-\nINTERIOR. SCIENCE LAB - DAY\nAldys and the Denominators- making smores over a bunson burner getting into a melted chocolate and marshmallow fight- and laughing hysterically-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nThe smart kids. Who everyone else always knew as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my friends.\nEXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - DAY\nGuy, Tommy and Jason, as they get out Guy's car, in the parking lot-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nAnd there's still that one guy, the one who is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders-\nEXTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\nWe focus in on Guy, as he takes the front steps two at a time-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\n- to the way he, in his own way, struggles to uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him. High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the same without him.\nINTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\nGuy, his buddies, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, sign yearbooks, hang out by the lockers-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nAll of these things made me miserable at seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us. A time that makes us who we are, for years to come.\nEXTERIOR. NEWSSTAND - DAY\nHANDS grab Chicago Sun Times at the newsstand-\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nHigh school- going through it the first time- helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that who I am is O.K. I always wanted to be \"in\", but seven years later, when they finally opened the door, I somehow gained the confidence to stay outside, firmly, happily.\nEXTERIOR. \"EL\" TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY\nAbout 75% of the people have their Life and Style sections opened, reading Josie's piece.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nThis is not the article I was sent in to write. This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second, my regrets are down to one.\nINTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - MORNING\nThe kitchen of a depressed guy--empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant. Sam pours milk into a bowl of Lucky Charms while he reads the Sports Section of the paper.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nA certain teacher was trampled in my path to self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no way makes up for what I did to him.\nHe's not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl, soaking the table.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\nTo this man, you know who you are, I am so sorry.\nHe takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up the remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash can. He leaves the kitchen. WE HOLD ON the empty room.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\nAnd, I would like to add one more thing - I think I am in love with you.\nEXTERIOR. BASEBALL, STADIUM PARKING LOT \u0096 NIGHT\nCars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nAnd so I propose this - as an ending to this article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game \u0096 where my friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title.\nEXTERIOR. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT\nThe Southglen Rams baseball team minus Rob, are on the field, warming up.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nI will stand on the pitcher's mound for the five minutes prior to the first pitch. If this man accepts my apology, I ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real kiss.\nWe find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout.\nJOSIE\n (cont'd)\nFive minutes may seem like a short time, but trust me, when you've been waiting twenty-five years, it's usually the last five minutes that kill you.\nCU: THE PICTURE TAKEN OF JOSIE AND SAM AT THE PROM.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\nI went back to high school and discovered I was a loser, again.\nWIDEN TO REVEAL the picture on the fridge in--\nINTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - EVENING\nSam enters, still in sweats, carrying a book. He opens the fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it, is confronted by Josie's picture. He takes it down, looks at it.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\nAnd then I discovered it wasn't so bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that I'm ready to start living the rest of my life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him.\nSam lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash.\nJOSIE (V.O.)\n (cont'd)\nBecause inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better.\nWE FOLLOW Sam's stare down into the trash and see the photo lying on top and to the side of Josie's article--the photos from the article are clearly visible.\nANGLE ON HOT DOGS, POPCORN CHANGING HANDS being sold by the truckload at the stadium. The crowds are over capacity. Way over. People fill the parking lot, they cover every other inch of school grounds, as well. They stand on the roofs of nearby buildings, they sit on top of their cars. It looks like most of Chicago is either already there, or on their way.\nSome WOMEN hold signs for Josie, others hold and wave her article.\nJosie sticks her head out of the dugout, and looks out at the fans. TV REPORTERS are everywhere, including several on the field. She looks like she may faint. She ducks back in.\nINTERIOR. DUGOUT - SAME\nThe team is dressed, ready, excited. Anita and Aldys stand next to Josie. Josie looks up at the crowd, amazed.\nJOSIE\nWow. It's packed.\nANITA\nIt's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.\nALDYS\nIt's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.\nJOSIE\nWell I'm so glad that you guys are.\nJosie then starts to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her ankles. Anita and Aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to Josie. She hyperventilates into it. Coach Romano approaches. Josie puts the bag down.\nCOACH\nSweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there'd be all these TV crews here. This thing's gonna be on every station in the country.\nJosie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag again.\nCOACH\nYou more than kept your end of the bargain. Now go out there and get 'em.\nJosie gets up and he slaps her on the ass. She hugs Aldys. Then Anita gives Josie a big hug, and won't let go. Josie has to pull Anita pulls back. Josie struggles to get out of the hug- Anita won't let her. Finally, they are both laughing.\nJosie walks out of the dugout, and onto the field.\nEXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME\nShe walks, alone, out to the pitcher's mound, clutching a microphone. The crowd goes berserk. She stands until they quiet.\nJOSIE\nCould I have five minutes on the clock, please?\nThe scoreboard clock reads 5:00. Josie stands, alone.\nEXTERIOR. BOX SEATS \u0096 SAME\nThe staff from the Sun Times sits in box seats up front. Rigfort joins them, carrying a huge load of hot dogs.\nRIGFORT\nI got weiners. Hot weiners.\nRigfort sits next to Gus. Behind them sit Bruns, his hair finally growing in and Howard, now down to just a sling.\nRIGFORT\nI love this. Sun Times readers, out here, making a personal connection to one of our reporters. This is amazing, isn't it? Weiner?\nGus takes a weiner.\nGUS\nYeah, it is.\nRIGFORT\n(studying his weiner)\nWait a minute...\nRigfort pulls something small and shiny out of the bun.\nRIGFORT\n (cont'd)\nThere's a bolt in my weiner.\nThen he turns back to Howard and smiles.\nRIGFORT\n (cont'd)\nHey Howard, what are you doing for the next month?\nHoward's face falls.\nEXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME\nJosie still stands there. The clock is down to 2:30. She looks over to the dugout.\nEXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME\nThe Denominators talking and laughing. Behind them, sit the Marching Band\nEXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND \u0096 SAME\nJosie forces-a stoic smile. 1:00 is on the clock.\nEXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME\nThe cool crowd. Guy, Kirsten and the gang.
