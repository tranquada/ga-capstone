Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates\n          him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio\n          window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons.\n          Harvey closes the piano lid.\n          \n          \n          INT. STUDIO - DAY\n          \n          Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons,\n          sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV\n          monitors.

We hold   on his face - he's\n          tired. He looks about him, then down at   his raincoat draped\n          over his arm.

Well you've probably\n                    got it on file, but just in case,\n                    917...

HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n          \n          Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes\n          off his jacket and goes to the window.\n          \n          A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no\n          avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to\n          duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out.\n          \n          Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy\n          street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He\n          tries again - but it won't budge.\n          \n          He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted\n          blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower\n          the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and\n          unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window\n          sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in semi-darkness.\n          \n          Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to\n          the bed and retrieves it.\n          \n                               HARVEY\n                    Hello?\n                        (beat)\n                    Suzie!

MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He\n          turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely.

But he can't - Harvey sobs\n          huge heaving muffled cries...\n          \n          Just then, someone enters.

She sits down to have a pee. We hold\n          on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm.\n          But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her\n          cheek. She swats it away.\n          \n          \n          INT.

As the\n          ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into\n          applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his\n          daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips\n          out the door.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

He\n          finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward.\n          \n          Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a\n          businessman's shoulder. Kate leans forward to help, as the\n          businessman turns slightly irritated.\n          \n                              HARVEY (CONT'D)\n                    Sorry.\n                        (turning to Kate)\n                    Hi.\n                        (a little sheepish)\n                    I thought i might as well stay in\n                    town.

TRAIN - DAY\n          \n          Harvey and Kate stand next to each other, gently swaying, in\n          the crowded carriage. The businessman standing next to\n          Harvey, talks loudly on his phone about his day's conquest.\n          Harvey and Kate share a look. In a Keatonesque performance,\n          Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and\n          further away from the man, making Kate smile.\n          \n          \n          INT.

Susan shares a gentle smile with her\n          Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles\n          and nods.\n          \n                                 KATE\n                    Well done.\n          \n                                 HARVEY\n                    Really?\n          \n          She indicates to the rest of the table.

They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching.\n          \n                                                                     74.\n          \n          \n          \n          After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey\n          hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower\n          from the table display and places it in his lapel.\n          \n          Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking\n          Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance.\n          \n                              SUSAN\n                    Thanks for coming back Dad.\n          \n          Beat.\n          \n                              HARVEY\n                    Thanks for having me back.\n          \n          Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter.\n          Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's\n          head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate\n          smiles at her lot.\n          \n          Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over\n          the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by\n          Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred\n          pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes\n          up.\n          \n          Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended\n          family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at\n          all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family\n          celebrate alone.\n          \n          Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two\n          chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a\n          jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to\n          leave.\n          \n          Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey\n          caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie\n          around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to\n          look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing\n          children.\n          \n          Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate\n          amongst the crowded room.\n          \n          \n          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall\n          towards the bank of elevators.\n          \n                                                                     75.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the\n          distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight.\n          Harvey runs.\n          \n          \n          INT. ELEVATOR / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to\n          close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a\n          piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across\n          the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a\n          grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it\n          another `old school' burst.\n          \n          He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to\n          close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening\n          them.\n          \n          Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something\n          sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out\n          of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the\n          piano.\n          \n          \n          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join\n          him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully.\n          He's good.\n          \n          He finally brings the piece to an end.\n          \n                                 KATE\n                    Wow.\n          \n          Harvey blushes.\n          \n                              KATE (CONT'D)\n                    One of yours?\n          \n          Harvey smiles at Kate.\n          \n                                                         76.\n          \n          \n          \n                               HARVEY\n                    You are very kind.

It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in\n          turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up'\n          niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of\n          braces on her teenage teeth.\n          \n          Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye.
