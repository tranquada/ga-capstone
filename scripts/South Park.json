A wooden sign tells us this is South\n        Park.\n\n        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY\n\n        Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as\n        they walk by.\n\n        It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off\n        from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.\n\n        A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He\n        is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes\n        and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.\n\n                             STAN\n                   I'm going to the movies\n                   To see the brighter side of life!\n                   I'm going to the movie\n                   Everything's gonna be alright!\n                   Forget all my troubles\n                   Put my own life on hold\n                   Let a studio tell me\n                   how I should view the world\n                   Where everything works out\n                   I love it that way\n                   I'm going to the movies\n                   The movies today!\n\n        Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.\n\n        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n        We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes\n        off. BRRRRRTTT!!!\n\n                             RADIO ANNOUNCER\n                   Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty\n                   a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses\n                   and water the cows!!\n\n        From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his\n        bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.\n\n        We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his\n        closet and pulls out an orange coat.\n\n        The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the\n        hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.\n\n                             MOTHER (O.S.)\n                   KENNY!

KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN\n\n        Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the\n        kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are\n        sitting at the humble table.\n\n                             KENNY'S MOTHER\n                   Sit down, you can share some of your\n                   brother's waffle.\n\n        The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.\n\n        EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n        Kenny opens the door to find Stan.\n\n                             STAN\n                   Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is\n                   out! You wanna come?!\n\n        Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new\n        Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes\n        light up.\n\n                             KENNY\n                   Mph rmph rm, rmph!\n\n        Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.\n\n                             KENNY'S MOTHER\n                   Kenny!

And\n        then walks off with Stan anyway.\n\n        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY\n\n        Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the\n        happy beat.\n\n        TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his\n        Rhinoplasty office.\n\n                             TOM\n                   Say, where are you boys going?\n\n                             STAN\n                   We're going to the movies!\n                   To see the brighter side of life!\n                   Where everyone is beautiful\n                   And have their hair combed just\n                   right!\n\n                             KENNY\n                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!\n                   Mph rm rmph rm!\n                   Mprh rm rmph rm rm\n                   Rmph rm rmph rm rmph!\n\n                             TOM\n                   Have fun you rascals!\n\n        EXT.

But just then,\n        Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian\n        boy bounces up next to him.\n\n                             KYLE\n                   No, Ike!

His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight\n        year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He\n        speaks with a rich English accent.\n\n                             GREGORY\n                   Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly\n                   brush.\n\n        Stan looks at Gregory.\n\n                             STAN\n                   Who are you, kid?\n\n                             GREGORY\n                   My name is Gregory.

MIDGET W/BIKINI\n                   And the devastating impact of the\n                   Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and\n                   Phillip's new hit song, \"Shut Your\n                   Fucking Face, Unclefucka\" which has\n                   climbed the charts with a bullet --\n\n        We see a clip from the video, \"Unclefucka.\"\n\n        The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and\n        Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.

The\n                   controversy surrounding the Terrance and\n                   Phillip movie began in the small mountain\n                   town of South Park, Colorado where the\n                   local PTA banned the movie.  With us\n                   tonight is the head of the South Park\n                   PTA, Sheila Brofloski-\n\n        A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed.

As most of you know, the V-chip was\n                   created to lock children out of watching\n                   certain shows on television. And now the\n                   N.I.H. has created a new, exciting\n                   product that they can tell us all about.\n                   Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.\n                   Pangloss.\n\n        DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.\n\n                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS\n                   Thank you, parents.\n\n        One person claps.

The chip is placed just under the\n                   subject's skin, where it emits a small\n                   but painful shock of electricity whenever\n                   an obscenity is uttered.\n\n        The parents are fascinated.\n\n                             STAN'S FATHER\n                   Now wait a minute, are you telling us\n                   that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid\n                   is swearing?\n\n                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS\n                   It's just like a lie detector.

Goodnight.\n\n        She switches off the light, and leaves.\n\n        Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and\n        thinks.\n\n        He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but\n        then tries to close his eyes to sleep.\n\n                             CARTMAN\n                   Go away, scary noise.\n\n        Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -\n\n        KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.\n\n        Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.\n\n        Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he\n        makes no sound.\n\n        Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.\n\n        Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny\n        disappears.\n\n                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER\n                   Eric?! Eric, what is it?!\n\n                             CARTMAN\n                   I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!\n\n        Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she\n        just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.\n\n                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER\n                   Oh you poor dear.

He quietly creaks Satan's\n        door open and walks in.\n\n        Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   The execution of Terrance and Phillip is\n                   imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!\n\n        Kenny looks scared.\n\n                             SATAN\n                       (Evil and scary)\n                   Are you afraid, little one?

He sees a guard on a guard\n        tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing\n        in a line in rags.\n\n        The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see\n        the saddened faces of the Canadians.\n\n                             KYLE\n                   Do you see them?

The US army men cheer.\n\n        The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the\n        microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is\n        wearing an army helmet.

I've been acting\n                   since I was twelve and I can't\n                   distinguish between make believe and real\n                   life.\n\n        Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.\n\n                             WINONA RYDER\n                   And then I confuse me real life with my\n                   big-screen one.  And sure, people get\n                   hurt, and I'm sorry about that but\n                   Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault\n                   that I can get any guy I want.  And\n                   that's reality to me.  But you guys...\n                   wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It\n                   doesn't get any more real--  Now, this\n                   one goes out to you.\n\n        She cues the band which has been assembled from the same\n        helicopter.  Jazz music starts up.\n\n        It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.\n\n                             WINONA RYDER\n                   You know what I'm gonna do for you now,\n                   don't you?\n\n        'New York, New York' continues to play.\n\n                             WINONA RYDER\n                   WRONG!\n                       (Singing)\n                   The bells are ringin'\n                   For me and my gal!\n                   The birds are singin'\n                   For me and my gal!-\n   \n        INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - BELOW THE USO SHOW\n\n        The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all\n        fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight.\n\n                             CARTMAN\n                   Dude, this is seriously lame.

INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP\n\n        Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search\n        light passes over the hole.\n\n                             THE MOLE\n                   Sheet!\n\n        Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.\n\n        Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.\n\n        The whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE\n        barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A\n        dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with\n        Howitzers.  It doesn't look good.\n\n                             THE MOLE\n                   Move! Move!\n\n        One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the\n        ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building,\n        they all duck to avoid the search lights.\n\n                             THE MOLE\n                   Okay.... The Americans must be holding\n                   Terrance and Phillip in one of those\n                   bunkers. We will split up here.

Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and\n        slowly blows the smoke.\n\n                             THE MOLE\n                   Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you\n                   stand watch here and await my return.

Everybody just starts\n        screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and\n        complete mayhem.\n\n        One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and\n        Phillip stop drying.\n\n        The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and\n        right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.\n\n                             KYLE\n                   CARTMAN!\n\n                             CARTMAN\n                       (Frying)\n                   WAGAGAHGHGH!!

Kyle\n        picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.\n\n        INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM\n\n        Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his\n        cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.\n\n                             SATAN\n                       (Whispering)\n                   Have you finished?\n\n        Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He\n        holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last\n        drops underneath the bed.\n\n                             KENNY\n                   Mph mph.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   Then move out of the way.\n\n        Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of\n        matches.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   I must be strong... I must be strong...\n\n        Satan tries to light the match.

THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!\n\n        General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where\n        explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie\n        talkie as his men die all around him.\n\n                             GENERAL PLYMKIN\n                   ALRIGHT MEN!!!

A phalanx of black men, Chef included in\n        them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.\n\n                             GENERAL PLYMKIN\n                   REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!

Behind them is\n        a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops.\n\n                             GENERAL PLYMKIN\n                   Holy Mother of Johosephat...\n\n        The black guys all look at each other nervously.\n\n        EXT. BATTLEFIELD\n\n        The boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly\n        here and there.\n\n        A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the\n        boys holding a massive head wound.\n\n                             KYLE\n                   Hey!

The boys\n        run from the battle.\n\n        They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are\n        standing in a human shield around the white guys.\n\n                             CHEF\n                   Alright, squad...

SOUTH PARK - DAY\n\n        From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both\n        sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be\n        heard in the distance.\n\n        We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He\n        shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and\n        then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.\n\n                             MR. MACKEY\n                   Die Canadian, mmkay?!\n\n        And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.\n\n        But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of\n        nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.\n\n                             MR. MACKEY\n                   Mkay-\n\n        Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs\n        through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around\n        gunfire.\n\n                             BIG GAY AL\n                   Ooh!

Satan looks over to\n        the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another\n        figure.\n\n        He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini\n        glass in his hand.\n\n                             SADDAM HUSSEIN\n                   Hey, I'm missing the party!\n\n                             SATAN\n                   No!

Saddam is\n        thrown back against the wall.\n\n                             SADDAM HUSSEIN\n                       (To Satan)\n                   What are you waiting for, bitch?!

You know how I get\n                   mad when I get embarassed.\n\n        Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from\n        his nostrils.\n\n                             SADDAM HUSSEIN\n                   Your little problems can wait til later,\n                   see?\n\n        Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.\n\n                             SADDAM HUSSEIN\n                   Now do what I say and keep your fucking\n                   mouth shut!\n\n                             SATAN\n                   THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!\n\n        Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming\n        cliff, back into the depths of hell.\n\n                             SADDAM HUSSEIN\n                   NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!!

All he wanted\n                   was sex.  But it took me so long to\n                   figure that out.\n\n        He starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky.\n\n                             CHEF\n                   Here you go Satan-\n\n                             SATAN\n                   Thank you.

Any\n                   wish you want is yours.\n\n        TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny\n        speaks.\n\n                             KENNY\n                   Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.\n\n        Everyone GASPS!!\n\n                             KYLE\n                   WHAT?\n\n                             STAN\n                   Are you sure, Kenny?\n\n                             SATAN\n                   What did he say?\n\n                             STAN\n                   He said that his wish is for everyone who\n                   died in the war to come back.\n\n                             CHEF\n                   Kenny, you realize this wish is the only\n                   chance for YOU not to be dead...\n\n                             KENNY\n                   M mprh.

I will put an end to the\n                   war as your wish and make everything as\n                   it was before the war started. But you\n                   Kenny, must remain dead.\n\n                             KENNY\n                   Mph rm.\n\n        Satan turns to the open abyss.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's\n                   too fucking cold up here.\n\n                             STAN\n                   Aren't there cold parts of hell?\n\n                             SATAN\n                   Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's\n                   the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm\n                   destined to live in hell... alone...\n\n        Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But\n        something catches his eye.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   Hello... What's this?\n\n        Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and\n        then places it gently on his hand.\n\n                             SATAN\n                   Hi there, little guy... Would you like to\n                   go to hell with me?\n\n                             SATAN (AS MR. HAT)\n                   Sure. I bet we can be best friends!\n\n        Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.\n\n        The boys walks over to Kenny.\n\n                             KYLE\n                   Thank you, Kenny.\n\n                             STAN\n                   Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for\n                   us. You're a real pal.\n\n        A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are\n        dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.\n\n        At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others\n        who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at\n        themselves, wondering what just happened.\n\n        Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and\n        Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.\n\n                             MR. GARRISON\n                   I... I'm alive...

Where the hell do you keep it?\n                   It's huge.\n\n        Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits\n        into Wendy's mouth.\n\n                             STAN\n                   But Wendy...

Look!\n\n        Kyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to\n        see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.\n\n        We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.\n        As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting\n        towards the heavens.\n   \n        As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and\n        up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D\n        CGI)\n\n        Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into\n        the warmth of the baby blueness.\n\n        Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile\n        gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good.\n\n        Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...\n        into Heaven.\n\n                                                                  END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Park\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Trey Parker\u00a0\u00a0Matt Stone\u00a0\u00a0Pam Brady\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Animation\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Musical\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:05.327650"}
