Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and \nface are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too?

Her face begins to \n<b>SMOKE AND SINGE...\n</b>\nThe lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the \nsoundstage, adding to the chaos.\n\n<b>ON GEOFF\n</b>\nAs he witnesses the whole event.

The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder.\n\nGeoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening \nvery fast:\n\n--Renee's hand is lifted.

AND NOW, \nWE CAN make out the faint form of A PLANE as the conveyor descends \nfrom the cargo compartment.\n\nThe casket reaches the end of the conveyor. A tag marks its final \ndestination: Bangor, Maine. HANDS reach in and lift the casket. \nFOUR BAGGAGE HANDLERS hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and \ncarry it off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHANDLER #1\n</b>\t\tIs it true she grew up around\n\t\there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHANDLER #2\n</b>\t\tYeah.

Renee's grave is next to those of her parents.\n\nAmong the mourners is MARJORIE HARGROVE, an attractive local girl \nin her early twenties.\n\nFurther down the hillside, a wall of NEWS REPORTERS are gathered \nbehind a roped-off media boundary. There is a blinding flurry of \nPHOTO FLASHES as the press records the scene before them.\n\nA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL CAR cruises up the cemetery drive, \npulling to a stop near the mob of reporters.\n\nOut of the car steps GUS GILBERT. Gus is nearly forty, with a \nSheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame.

Chase gently \nplaces a comforting hand on Geoff's shoulder.\n\nGeoff inches forward, pulling free of Chase's touch. Drawn to his \nmother, drawn from his father. The only blemishes on his youthful, \nrosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tI know that my redeemer liveth,\n\t\tand that he shall stand at the\n\t\tlatter day upon the earth.\n\nGeoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair.\n\n<b>FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY\n</b>\nThe crowd has dispersed.\n\nGeoff is standing at the base of Renee's grave.

Something is moving \naround inside it.\n\nGeoff's eyes widen. Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward.\n\nThe box rustles again. He reaches for it and...\n\nA CREATURE LEAPS out at him, HOWLING. Geoff SCREAMS and jumps \nback. The box tumbles over and...\n\nA CAT crawls out. Behind the protective mother, are four of the \ncutest kittens we've ever seen, MEWING away.\n\nGeoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tWhat's wrong?!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tNothing. I just got spooked by a\n\t\tbunch of furballs.\n\nInside the box is a note. Chase reaches for it. It reads: \"And a \nwarm welcome to you.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tGreat, now I've opened an\n\t\torphanage too.\n\nOne of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with \nsleepy eyes. Her fur is striped.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tWell, I'll take one. If it's\n\t\tokay...\n\nGeoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tShe looks like a tiger.\n\nChase spies an old broom resting in the corner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tTell you what, you do some\n\t\tsweeping up here, and she's yours.\n\nGeoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway.\n\nGeoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other \nkittens. He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away \nthe cobwebs.\n\nJust as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the \nbox, spilling over onto the floor.\n\n<b>INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM\n</b>\nChase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies. When he places \nthem in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust.\n\nTiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of \ndust.\n\n<b>INT.  WAITING AREA\n</b>\nTiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore \nwhat lies beyond--\n\nThe door swings open...\n\nZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and \nwhite with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and \nmajestic.\n\nA pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's \ncollar.\n\nZowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling.\n\nDrew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal \ncommand calls after Drew from outside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tDrew, you get a handle on that\n\t\tdog, now!\n\n<b>INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM\n</b>\nChase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the \nfloor with the barking dog in pursuit.\n\nMayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile.\n\nGeoff rushes in from the boarding area.\n\nTiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney.\n\nZowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, \nstriking paw.\n\nDrew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. \nHe pulls the dog back.\n\nGeoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney.\n\nDrew shrugs sheepishly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tSorry. He gets kinda hyper...\n\nDrew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering \nvoice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at \nRenee's funeral.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tHell, he thought it was lunch.\n\t\tHow ya doin', Chase?\n\t\t\t(a handshake)\n\t\tYou haven't met my boy.\n\t\t\t(aside)\n\t\tDrew, where the hell are your\n\t\tmanners.\n\nDrew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then \nGeoff. The boys shake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tHe's a cool lookin' dog.\n\nZowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff \nstrokes the dog's soft mane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tWhat's his name?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tZowie.\n\nDrew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to \nsee. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tDamn dog stuck his nose in on my\n\t\trabbits and they ganged up on him.\n\t\tI swear that dog's an idiot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tIs he gonna be okay?\n\nWith one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the \nexamination table and wipes it clean.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tLet's have him hop up here.\n\nDrew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over \nthe facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the \ndog's eyes.\n\nGus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, \nmaking sure it meets with Geoff's approval.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tWhen I was young I thought cats\n\t\twere the girls and dogs were the\n\t\tboys.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tThere are three more girls where\n\t\tthat one came from looking for\n\t\thomes.\n\nDrew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tNot our home.\n\nChase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tThee facial lacerations should heal\n\t\tup pretty quickly. I'll give you\n\t\tsom antibiotic cream--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\t--Drew, he's your dog.

He really is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\t\t(awkward)\n\t\tGeoff... you have to help me out\n\t\there a little...\n\n\"MEOW!\" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in \nGeoff's jacket. He can't help but smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tAre you sure you don't want me to\n\t\tpick you up. It's a long ride.\n\nGeoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN \n<b>BIKE.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tThat's what my bike's for...\n\nBefore Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone.\n\n<b>EXT.

SCHOOL - DAY\n</b>\nDrew is among a small circle of BOYS. He recognizes Geoff walking \nhis bike from the van. The largest of the boys, CLYDE, takes \nnotice of the unfamiliar face.\n\nClyde is fifteen, going on twenty. You know the type: local bully, \nheld back a year or two.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tCheck it out. That's the new kid.\n\t\tThe son of that movie star.\n\nMischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move. \nThe other boys follow suit. Clyde always takes the lead.\n\nGeoff fields their penetrating stares. For a second his eyes \nconnect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building.\n\nAmong the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant.\n\n<b>INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY\n</b>\nMRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS.\n\nGeoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as \nhe tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new \nclassmates are giving him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS. GORDON\n</b>\t\tPeople, this is Geoff Matthews.\n\t\tHe'll be joining our class for the\n\t\trest of the school year...\n\nAs Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower. \nThis is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like \nto throttle Mrs. Gordon.\n\nA freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOUG\n</b>\t\tHey, what's Hollywood like?

GORDON\n</b>\t\tSusan! That'll be enough.\n\nSusan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat.\n\nThe kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room.\n\nBut one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde.\n\nClyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He\ncatches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out.\n\n<b>INT.  HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nGeoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the \nday. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD, \nfall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not \nreally wanting to be a part of the intimidation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tWhat's the hurry, Junior? Where\n\t\tyou off to?\n\nClyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in \nfront of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded \nby peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age.\n\nOn the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde \nglances at it. Geoff follows his gaze.\n\n<b>DISPLAY\n</b>\nIt's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper \nletters spelling out: \"WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW.\" Beneath that are \npictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly \ntasteless.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\t\t(feigning remorse)\n\t\tToo bad about your Mom. Papers\n\t\tsaid it was pretty gross, getting\n\t\tfried like that.

Geoff reluctantly hands the \nkitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would \nnever question his sincerity.\n\nGeoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in \nClyde's tone, something sinister.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tHey, Geoff. You ever seen a\n\t\tkitten run?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tI've seen her run around the\n\t\thouse.\n\nClyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's \nheart starts to sink.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tNo, I mean really run...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tLike this!\n\nClyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger.

He's torn, but he tears off after them \nnonetheless.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tShit...\n\nGeoff runs off in pursuit of them.\n\n<b>EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY\n</b>\nGeoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd. \nThere they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the \nstreet.\n\nClyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as \nthey ride by.\n\nGeoff runs for the bike racks.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAY\n</b>\nClyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out \nonto the open road.\n\nClyde glances back toward the center of town.\n\nGeoff is so far behind he's barely visible.\n\nClyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to \nnose with him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tHaving fun yet?\n\nClyde and his smirking buddies ride on, OUT OF FRAME.\n\n<b>WITH GEOFF\n</b>\ngiving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the \nboys.\n\n<b>35    OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>FURTHER ALONG\n</b>\nScattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead. Cochran Lake \nstretches into the distance beyond the housing.\n\nClyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a \nresidential property. The two-story house is weathered and boarded \nup. It looks vaguely familiar. Creepy.\n\nAnd when WE FIND the mailbox post, we know why. The name is faded, \nbut there's no question who once lived there. Five bold letters: \n<b>\"CREED.\"\n</b>\nGeoff whips by in a blur, still in pursuit.\n\n<b>EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n</b>\nClyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes. They've taken \nposition on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of \n<b>THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY.\n</b>\n<b>38    OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

He dismounts and \nleans it up against a tree.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tJust give me the cat, all right?\n\nA devilish grin creeps over Clyde. He strolls down the path toward \nGeoff.

Drew shrinks back.\n\nGeoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde.\n\nAll of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent. There's \nsomething frightening about Clyde... something that extends beyond \nthe standard bully antics. We begin to get the feeling that this \nkid is genuinely deranged.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\t\t(relishing the\n\t\t\tmoment)\n\t\tYou heard about the Creed murders\n\t\tyet?

Maybe\n\t\tyou could dig up your Mom and take\n\t\ther back there. Maybe if you pray\n\t\treal hard, she'll come back.\n\nWith this last remark Clyde has pushed too far. Geoff's face is \nred with anger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tJust give me the cat, ass-hole.\n\nClyde's grin falters a moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tExcuse me, maybe I'm a little hard\n\t\tof hearing... but did you just call\n\t\tme an ass-hole?\n\nClyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tYou mad, Geoff?

What's the\n\t\tmatter with you?\n\nClyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT, catching \neveryone off guard.\n\nFor an instant, Drew marvels at Geoff's tenacity.\n\nClyde LUNGES. He hammers Geoff with blows.\n\nOutsizing him by forty pounds, Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground. \nGeoff struggles, but Clyde's grip proves arresting.\n\nClyde throws Geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the \ndirt. It looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent.\n\nDrew is the first to rush in. Brad and Stevie quickly follow. It \ntakes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff.\n\nClyde gets to his feet and backs away. There's great pleasure in \nhis crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tFuckin' ass-hole.\n\nSatisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, Clyde turns \naway.\n\nDrew's attentions remain on Geoff. As Clyde strolls by, he grabs \nDrew's arm and swings him around.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tThis way, fat-boy.\n\nStevie and Brad follow. As the group passes Geoff's bike, Clyde \ngives it a kick, knocking it over. Then they're gone.\n\nGeoff pulls himself to his feet. Brushing off the mess, he heads \nup the path in search of Tiger.\n\n<b>EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY\n</b>\nThe woods here have grown long with shadows. The air is still and \nthe sound of birds is conspicuously absent.\n\nA WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. \nScrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely \nlegible attempt at \"PET SEMATARY.\"\n\nGeoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. \nCollars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the \nmakeshift crosses and headstones.\n\nGeoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a \nchild's caring hands.\n\nAs he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. \nOn the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: \n<b>SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT.\n</b>\nMOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read \nconvey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death.\n\nHere is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: \"In \nMemory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965.\"\n\nThe next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered \nbeyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH \n<b>THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939.\n</b>\nAnd now... \"MEOW.\" Faint. But very much alive.\n\nGeoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center.\n\nThere, he finds Tiger. Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base \nswallowed by the grave.\n\nGeoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling \nkitten.\n\nGeoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall...\n\nTHE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of \nskeletal remains. An abstract stairway to things beyond. A wind \npicks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the \nground.\n\n<b>40    OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

Bells \npositioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play.\n\nGus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage.\n\nFinishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. \nMoving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into \nfeeding slots for the hungry rabbits.\n\nSetting the feed aside, he takes a seat. Opening one of the cages, \nhe grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft \nfur.\n\nOne of the cages starts to vibrate.\n\nGus gives it a look: A PAIR OF RABBITS aren't interested in \neating, they're joined in fast and furious passion.\n\nGus gets a chuckle out of the sight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tWay to go, Romeo...\n\nGus replaces the rabbit in the hutch.

DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n</b>\nAmanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up \nbehind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand, \nhe sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of \nthe neck.\n\nGus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and \npresses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to \nhim.\n\nShe stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tGus, please...\n\nAt the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, \ndisgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the \ndoor open as loud as he can to signal his return.\n\nGus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off. \nBut before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving \nplatter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into \nhis mouth suggestively.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tGod damn, you're good.\n\nDrew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his \nattention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on.\n\nGus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his \nspot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to \nthe side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same \nside to obstruct his view.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tYou're breaking the law here,\n\t\tDrew.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tReally, Gus.

Stop being a little jerk\n\t\tand show her some appreciation.\n\nDrew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and \nsilences the TV.\n\nAmanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table, \nDrew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork \nwith the serving fork.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tNot that much appreciation.

And \nthen WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags. Snoozing rabbits awaken as \nZowie lumbers INTO FRAME.\n\nZowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. Blue \nsparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge.\n\n<b>INT.  GUS' ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF \nBELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep. \nHe rolls out of bed and grabs his robe.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tDamn it, Drew.

Drew is one step behind.\n\nGus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT.\n\nZowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside.\n\nDrew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tDon't shoot him!\n\nGus' eyes are wild with anger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tWhat, Drew?

All the while, his eyes remain \non Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned.\n\nHe squeezes off one more SHOT...\n\nA PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside. Zowie's yelp.\n\nDrew whips his head aside in sickened shock. Even Gus is sobered \nby the unexpected hit.\n\nAll they can hear now are Zowie's WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in \nthe night.\n\nDrew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is \nspeechless. He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark \nhillside.\n\nWhen Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tJesus, Gus, what have you done?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tAh, come on, Amanda, stop looking\n\t\tat me like that.

WOODS - NIGHT\n</b>\nDrew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie...\n\nNothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him.\n\n<b>DEEPER IN THE WOODS\n</b>\nZowie limps INTO FRAME. Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in \nhis left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. Every step \nis a strain.\n\n<b>DREW\n</b>\ncomes upon a break in the trees. The hanging moon outlines the \nknoll stretching beyond. And then, the strained breathing, the \nhushed WHIMPER.\n\nDrew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll.\n\nZowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody \ntrail. His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every \neffort to survive.\n\nDrew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his \nlap, shaking his head in denial.\n\nZowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew.\n\nDrew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the \ndog through his glaze of tears.\n\nZowie's eyes drift off. His chest falls and doesn't rise again. He \nfalls limp in Drew's arms. Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he \nbegins to weep.\n\n<b>FROM A DISTANCE\n</b>\nWE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, \nsilhouetted against the moonlit horizon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>53    OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

Then he \nsees the dried blood staining Drew's clothes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tZowie's dead.\n\nGeoff's heart sinks. An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between \nthe boys. Fighting the emotions, Drew finally speaks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tI have to bury him. I don't want\n\t\tto go out there alone.\n\nThere's such grief in Drew's words that Geoff can't resist.

Geoff is following, \nbalancing a pickaxe and shovel.\n\nArriving at the graveyard, Geoff searches the outer perimeter for \na vacant stretch of soil.

THE BOG - DAY\n</b>\nGeoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall...\n\nBeyond is a dark swamp, A BOG, looking unlike anything one would \nexpect in Maine. Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation \nthat looks almost prehistoric. Gnarled trees rise up from the \nmurky earth, blocking the sun from view.\n\nGeoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with \nDrew. Somewhere off in the distance we hear an UNEARTHLY SOUND. \nNot a bird. Not any animal known to man.\n\nSpectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoff's vision, sinking \nback into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\t\t(uneasy)\n\t\tDrew, where are we going?\n\nDrew doesn't respond. He continues on without another word, hell-\nbent on finding this \"better place.\"\n\n<b>FURTHER ALONG - DAY\n</b>\nAt the boundary of the bog, A STAIRWAY OF HUGE, WIDE STONES rises \nfrom the blanket of ground fog. Bordered by fir trees. Leading up \nthe hillside. The final leg of Drew and Geoff's journey.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tThis is it...

MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DAY\n</b>\nEven in broad daylight, the flat-topped mesa has a sense of \nforeboding isolation. There's an almost palpable sense of \n\"wrongness\" about this place. As if the darkness of a dying black \nhole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth.\n\nDrew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil.

From there, he watches.\n\nDrew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the \nrocky ground.\n\nWE MOVE IN ON GEOFF, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as \nthe rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues.\n\n<b>59    OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>LATER -\n</b>\nA cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave.\n\nDrew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff.

With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew \nsnatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth. Geoff does the \nsame.\n\nThey sit together in silence. Nervously chewing their gum. \nWatching the grave.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tI've never had anyone die\n\t\tbefore...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t...but I guess you get over it.

En route, Drew pauses for a \nlast look at the grave.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tSo long, Zowie...\n\nGeoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground. It looks \nmagical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT\n</b>\nDrew is walking home along the road, alone.\n\nHeadlights blind him as a car approaches. It slows and pulls a U-\nturn, stopping at Drew's side. It's Gus' squad car.

Fur shiny and \nwet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. Zowie's head hangs low, \nhis eyes GLEAMING RED. The husky is covered with dirt from head to \ntoe.\n\nDrew's eyes widen in astonishment.\n\nZowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the \nfloorboards. Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog \nmoves closer.\n\nZowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap. \nAnd slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek.

His hand moves beneath the \nsheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. \nAmanda shivers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tGod, you're ice cold...\n\t\t\t(turning)\n\t\t...and you smell! Lord, what did\n\t\tyou get yourself into?\n\nIt's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is \nseeping through the gauze.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tMy God, Gus, what happened?\n\nAmanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of \nthe bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her \nbreasts.\n\nAmanda tries to twist away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tGus... stop it! What's wrong with\n\t\tyou?!\n\nBut Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly \nforcing her back onto the bed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tGus!!!\n\nAmanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. \nWith one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her \nnightgown with the other.\n\nWe pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The \nshower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAY\n</b>\nGeoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school \nbooks. Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. When Geoff \napproaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed.\n\n<b>WITH THE BOYS - RIDING\n</b>\nGeoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something. \nDrew maintains his enigmatic expression.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tWell?\n\nDrew nods. Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDREW\n</b>\t\tPicture this... Gus comes down to\n\t\tbreakfast and he doesn't say a\n\t\tword. He even kind of smiles,\n\t\tlike he forgot he hates me.

YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY\n</b>\nQUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair. His world is \nclosed off from daylight by the extensive blinds.\n\nHe's holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap. Its big brown eyes are \nstaring back at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOLANDER\n</b>\t\tYou'd be so much more interesting\n\t\twith blue eyes...\n\nAnd now, ONE OF THE POODLE'S EYES POPS OUT. Yolander's finger \ncomes through from beneath the eye socket.\n\nOn closer examination, WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at \nall. Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass.\n\nHe carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and \nselects the right shade of blue. A shot of whiskey rests nearby.\n\nYolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes \nsecurely into place.\n\nThere's a KNOCK at the door. Yolander ignores it. Maybe he's deaf. \nAnother KNOCK. Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the \nintrusion. And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness.\n\nPULLING BACK, we see the rest of the room. Stuffed animals are \ncrowded from floor to ceiling. A product of Yolander's obsession \nwith TAXIDERMY.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOLANDER\n</b>\t\tI'm immortalizing a poodle.

Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's \nstomach.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\t...a dog...\n\nYolander rises from his seat and swings open the door.\n\nChase stands in the doorway, startled.

It takes a second for \nChase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed.\n\nNow Chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed \nanimals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\t\t(momentarily thrown)\n\t\t...the pathologist... he said that\n\t\tyou had reported a similar \n\t\tincident... with a cat...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOLANDER\n</b>\t\tThe Creed cat, that's right.\n\t\tBastard's name was \"Church\".\n\t\t\t(grins)\n\t\tLet me guess.

And so\n\t\twas his wife the night she was\n\t\tkilled for the second time...\n\nAs Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole \nshelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on \nits perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOLANDER\n</b>\t\t\t(menacing)\n\t\tYou want some advice, friend? You\n\t\tget in your car, you pick up your\n\t\tfamily... and you get the hell out\n\t\tof that town.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tWell... uh... thanks...\n\nChase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps \ninto the stuffed raven's perch...\n\n...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and \n<b>SCREECHES.\n</b>\nChase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the \ndoorway.\n\n<b>116D  OMITTED\n</b><b>THRU\n</b><b>116F  OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

It hits the edge of the \nplate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on.\n\nGus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant \nlook in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, \nsending a chill up Geoff's spine.\n\nGeoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes \nthe plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's \nquick hands save it from hitting the table.\n\nAmanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus \na cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry \nover last night.\n\nGus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before, \nhe lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The \nlima beans shower the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tGod damnit, Gus! This isn't\n\t\tfunny!\n\nAmanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess.\n\nGeoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the \nsalt...\n\n...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps.\n\nGus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen \nsmile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than \nplayfulness.\n\nGeoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably. \nThere's no other response.\n\nGus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food \nover his shirt and plate as he does so.\n\nThe boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going.\n\nAmanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room.\n\nThrough his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part \nof his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and \n<b>GOOEY PUS.\n</b>\nDrew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage.\n\nGrossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside.\n\n<b>INT.

He looks bad. Real bad. His \nbandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping. His \nface is unearthly pale. He's deteriorated considerably since \nyesterday.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\t\t(startled)\n\t\tJesus Christ, Gus!\n\nGus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tGo home.\n\nBut Geoff remains frozen.

With one hand \nunder the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator \nhandlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde.\n\nGus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator.\n\nTHE REAR WHEEL SPINS.

He's holding a pickaxe and shovel \nat his side.\n\nGus looks to the ground at his side. Geoff follows his gaze...\n\n<b>A VISION OF RENEE'S GRAVE APPEARS -\n</b>\nHeadstone. Manicured grass. Thriving flowers. As if it had been \nuprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down \nright in the middle of the Micmac ground.\n\nAnd now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away. In its place is a \nbundle of white: RENEE'S SHROUDED BODY.\n\nGus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tYou bury your own, Geoff.\n\nGeoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason.\n\n<b>169   OMITTED\n</b><b>THRU\n</b><b>177   OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nMarjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND \nof a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARJORIE\n</b>\t\tGeoff?\n\n<b>INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nMarjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic. \nThe thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from \nthe sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARJORIE\n</b>\t\tGeoff? You okay up there?\n\n<b>INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT\n</b>\nMarjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is \nforgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia.\n\nShe moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered \nreverence.\n\nThe gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she \nglimpses something beyond the curtains...\n\n<b>A FIGURE\n</b>\nstands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that \nMarjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee, \nbut as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been \nfitted onto a dressmaker's model.\n\nMarjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the \ndesign.\n\n<b>EEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house. \nPulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door...\n\n<b>ZOWIE\n</b>\nLEAPS out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's \nshoulder.\n\nChase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the \nnightmare dog as it tears into him again and again...\n\nChase SCREAMS, reaching back for the gun. He grabs hold of it and \nswings it around... FIRES...\n\nZowie is BLOWN backwards, clear out of the car, spraying CHASE \nwith BLOOD...\n\nZowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned. His chest is a \nruined mess. Zowie WHIMPERS and drags himself weakly towards the \nfront porch.\n\nChase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun. He's bleeding \nprofusely.\n\n<b>179   OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  PORCH - NIGHT\n</b>\nAn old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole \nthat's been cut in the base of the front door.\n\nChase gives it a look as he tries the door. It's unlocked. Chase \nenters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his \nheadlights.\n\n<b>INT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the \ninterior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A \ntrail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is \nrepulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tJesus...\n\nAs Chase moves forward, he catches sight of...\n\n<b>GUS\n</b>\nstanding in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue \nlolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered \naround the dog are various tools.\n\nPropped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's \nfitted with hinges at the top.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tGus, what are you doing?!\n\nGus glances down at the dead dog.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\t\t(dead-pan)\n\t\tI was building a doggy door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tGod damn it Gus, you dug up my\n\t\twife!

A little\n\t\tkilling.\n\nAs Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first \ntime. He doesn't look even remotely alive.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tHoly shit!\n\nChase levels his gun with a trembling hand.\n\nGus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.\n\nChase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF \nFLESH explodes from his back.\n\nUnphased, Gus regains his balance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tGod I hate when that happens...\n\nBefore Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from \nhis grip...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tYou got a permit for that?\n\nOpening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses \nthe gun aside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\tDidn't think so.\n\nGus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, \nknocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO \n<b>CHASE'S ARM...\n</b>\nChase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's \nshoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is \nunbearable...\n\nGus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\t\t(maniacal)\n\t\tNo brain, no pain, Chase. Think\n\t\tabout it...\n\nThe whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He \nclutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside...\n\nAt the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the \ndrill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK.\n\nGus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away...\n\nChase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, \nscooping it up...\n\nBULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps \nhis palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber...\n\nGus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around \nand SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet...\n\nChase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him...\n\nHe brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined \nthroat. Gus just keeps on throttling him...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUS\n</b>\t\t\t(insane)\n\t\tJust remember, Chase... I had Renee\n\t\tfirst... and now I'm gonna have her\n\t\tlast...\n\nBLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by \nthe incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a \n<b>HEAVY THUD.\n</b>\nChase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tGeoff!\n\n<b>EXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. \nHe swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the \nkey into the ignition.\n\n<b>INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT\n</b>\nMarjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, \nentranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress.\n\nWith the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has \nturned herself into a stunning beauty.\n\nThe lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop \nmagnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her \nface fills nearly the entire mirror...\n\n...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic \nbehind her.\n\nA HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie \nnearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARJORIE\n</b>\t\tJesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on\n\t\tme like that!\n\n...but no one is there.\n\nTHE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS, \nmagnified tenfold. The lips begin to move...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tDid you really think you could be\n\t\tlike me?\n\nRenee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror...\n\nMarjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying \nglass. And as her hands come down, she finds...\n\nRenee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by \nmoonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her.\n\nMarjorie's face goes white with fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tSuch a young face... but you've got\n\t\tpotential...\n\nRenee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her \nhead back...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tWe'll do the eyes first. You\n\t\talways start with the eyes...\n\nRenee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath \nMarjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS.\n\n<b>INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nGeoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising \nfrom his bed.\n\n<b>185   OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nGeoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the \nopen door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tMarjorie? You know you're not\n\t\tsupposed to be in the attic.\n\nGeoff starts up the stairs.\n\n<b>INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT\n</b>\nGeoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy \ncurtains. And then he sees her...\n\nRenee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made \nup. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles \nwarmly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b>\t\tMom...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tI came back for you, Geoff. We're\n\t\tgoing to be together again.\n\nRenee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the \nhaze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in \nher eyes.\n\n<b>INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT\n</b>\nReaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.\n\n<b>188B  OMITTED\n</b>\n<b>INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT\n</b>\nChase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil \nswings the CREAKING door shut behind him.\n\nFrom Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his \nway around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright \ndressing mirror. And then he sees...\n\n<b>MARJORIE\n</b>\nSlumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half \nof her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tMarjorie?\n\nMarjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her \nface. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back...\n\nChase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them...\n\n<b>RENEE AND GEOFF\n</b>\nHolding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's \nbreast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her \nvoice is both seductive and terrifying.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tHello, Chase.\n\nChase gasps. The word \"horror\" doesn't do the moment justice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tOh my God...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tWe can try again, Chase. We can\n\t\tmake it work this time.\n\nChase sinks back against the wall.

Renee's dead...\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tGeoff! Get over here now!\n\nBut Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance \nflickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\t\t(looking at Chase)\n\t\tGeoff, honey, why don't you go\n\t\tdownstairs. Your father and I\n\t\tneed a moment alone.

He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for \nthe attic door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tGeoff...\n\nGeoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a \nhauntingly familiar ring...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b>\t\tI love you.\n\nGeoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and...\n\n<b>CLYDE\n</b>\nis standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is \ntorn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from \nhead to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of \nthe undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\t\t(grinning)\n\t\tHey, Junior. Wanna play?\n\nWHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in \nfront of Geoff's face...\n\nGeoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance.\n\nClyde brings the axe down...\n\n...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHASE\n</b>\t\tGeoff!\n\nChase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde \nbrings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt \nend...\n\nChase goes down. Unconscious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tOops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-\n\t\tboo...\n\nClyde turns his gaze back on Geoff.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tNow, where were we?\n\nGeoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the \nroom.\n\nRenee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps \noff the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside.\n\nScared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings \nagain and misses...\n\nGeoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys \ngo down...\n\n<b>RENEE\n</b>\nMoves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending \neverything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles \nSHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor.\n\nRenee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the \nflame to the perfume-soaked floor...\n\nFLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, \nigniting the curtains...\n\nWe see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.\n\n<b>ON GEOFF AND CLYDE\n</b>\nAs they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle \ndrips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl.\n\nClyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his \nteeth...\n\nGeoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a \nmirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye...\n\nSomehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to \nhis feet...\n\nClyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe \nwildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. \nNothing's going to stop him. Nothing.\n\nFlames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the \ncanopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across \nthe floor...\n\nGeoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's \nnowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED \nCABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff \nturns...\n\nAnd here comes Clyde...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tHere it comes, buddy! HERE IT\n<b>\t\tFUCKING COMES!!!\n</b>\nClyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind \nhim, severing the insulated cables...\n\nAs Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff \nreaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES.\n\nClyde raises the axe above his head...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLYDE\n</b>\t\tEat it, ass-hole...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEOFF\n</b><b>\t\tEAT THIS!!!\n</b>\n...and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth!\n\nSPARKS shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears. He jerks back and \nforth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution.\n\nThen Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE \nFLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls...\n\nGeoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs \nto Chase...\n\nChase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his \nfather to his feet...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tDon't leave me again, Geoff!\n\nGeoff turns...\n\n<b>RENEE\n</b>\nis standing in the midst of the FLAMES, reaching out.

With Chase on his shoulder, he \nreaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall.\n\nHe spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the \naxe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door...\n\nIgnoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again, \nchopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames \nare almost upon them...\n\nFinally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and \ngrasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns \nand lifts Chase up once more...\n\nAt the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then \nhis face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENEE\n</b><b>\t\tNO, GEOFF! NO!!!\n</b>\n<b>ON RENEE\n</b>\nAlone in the fiery storm, SCREAMING.
