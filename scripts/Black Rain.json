The fact that casino gambling\n\thappens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these\n\tConnecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior\n\twiseguys from having a good time.\n\n<b>\tAT THE CARD TABLE\n</b>\n\tNICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a\n\twinning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of\n\tquiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.\n\tHis Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled\n\tshirt, out of date; Nick could care less.\n\n\tTwo other players are still in the game.  One of them is a\n\tlithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling\n\tfriends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.\n\n\tNick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\tOne, and one on top.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tDEALER\n</b>\t\t\tHouse sees.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPLAYER ONE\n</b>\t\t\t\t(hesitates)\n\t\t\tI'm out.\n\n\tDisgusted, he throws down his cards.\n\n\tIt's down to Nick and the debutante.

She smiles\n\tat him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.\n\tThat's life.\n\n\tA well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as\n\tCAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against\n\tthe wall.\n\n\tCharlie spins around to stop him --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\tWhoa -- where do you think you're\n\t\t\tgoing, hotdog.\n\n\tCavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the\n\tfloor.

Unfortunately,\n\tCavello has a good half block on him.\n\n\tFrom nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half\n\tblock behind, silently cursing his age.\n\n<b>\tAT THE CORNER\n</b>\n\ta limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.

The lawn is brown, paint is peeling\n\toff the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the\n\tdriveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking\n\tat the house.  His house.

Nick\n\thesitates.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tICH\n</b>\t\t\tYou can do it.\n\n\tNick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He\n\tbegins to slurp the noodles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tICH\n</b>\t\t\tLouder, pal, louder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\tJoyce, give the assistant Chief\n\t\t\tInspector a drink, would you?\n\n\tAs Joyce refills all their cups we...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY\n</b>\n\tIt's raining.  A sun shower.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.  POLICE STATION\n</b>\n\tCapt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain\n\tpour down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOLIVER\n</b>\t\t\t... Remember, counterfeiting is the\n\t\t\tFeds.  They'll be all over\n\t\t\tAbolofia's place.

Nick gets to his feet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOLIVER\n</b>\t\t\t\t(still not facing\n\t\t\t\t him)\n\t\t\tYou know, Nick, if you'd held on to\n\t\t\tthat plate, you could've been a very\n\t\t\trich man.\n\n\tOliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\tNever crossed my mind.\n\n\tOliver nods; he believes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOLIVER\n</b>\t\t\tBe careful on the run.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tIn contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.\n\tCops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans\n\tover flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone\n\twho will listen.\n\n<b>\tTHE RAIDING PARTY\n</b>\n\ta dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and\n\twindbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the\n\tback.\n\n<b>\tNICK\n</b>\n\twalks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his\n\tshoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find\n\n<b>\tICH\n</b>\n\tsitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to\n\tNew York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.\n\tIt lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.\n\n\tA Sergeant walks in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n</b>\t\t\tSaddle up.

Probably\n\t\t\tbetter than the Greyline Tour.\n\n\tIch stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.\n\tHe helps Nick fasten the strap in back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tICH\n</b>\t\t\tYou wouldn't make it without me.\n\n\tNick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and\n\ttosses it into the trash.\n\n\tNick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack\n\tfor himself.\n\n\tWe watch from behind as the two men head down the long\n\thallway toward the exit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tICH\n</b>\t\t\tThink we'll get him, Nick?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\tWe can't lose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tICH\n</b>\t\t\tHow can you be so sure?\n\n\tNick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.
