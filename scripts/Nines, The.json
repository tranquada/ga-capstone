We're extremely\n      close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first\n      moments after a dream -- just fragments.\n\n      Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left\n      wrist. A loop. A bracelet.\n\n      We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the\n      knot tight.\n\n      His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break\n      easily.\n\n                                                FADE OUT.\n\n\n101                                                                    101\n      PITCH BLACK\n\n      There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some\n      distant birds CHIRPING.\n\n      Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.\n\n      A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,\n\n      revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly\n      fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's\n      merely a TV star.)\n\n      Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a\n      car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of\n      bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam\n      snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.\n\n      Gary spots what he was looking for.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n\n102                                                                    102\n      EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)\n\n      Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is\n      broken, SCRAPING against the deck.\n\n      WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the\n      city. He couldn't fucking care less.\n\n      He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it\n      down the canyon.\n\n                                                                  2.\n\n      He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's\n      clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in\n      their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping\n      it down with a flip-flopped foot.\n\n      He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins\n      drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container\n      is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really\n      empty.\n\n      Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And\n      spraying.\n\n      We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of\n      Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making\n      her unrecognizable.\n\n      Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,\n      soaking into the wooden deck.\n\n      Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He\n      takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his\n      pocket.\n\n103                                                                    103\n      EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.\n\n      On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.\n\n      MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us\n      through these MAIN TITLES.\n\n      In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails\n      through the air, tumbling end-over-end.\n\n      Just as it's about to reach its target, we...\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n\n104                                                                    104\n      A DIGITAL METER\n\n      shoots to 100 miles per gallon.

THE PRIUS - DAY\n\n      Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of\n      bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading\n      downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.\n\n      Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the\n      side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB (\"This fall, Mondays\n      are killer.\") Gary watches himself drive away.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n                                                                 3.\n\n106   Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a 106\n      low wall. He calls out to them:\n\n                              GARY\n                   Hey!

I'm only a cop on TV.\n\n\n\n      QUICK CUTS:\n\n      Money changes hands.\n\n      Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do\n      with its lumpy beige contents.\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n107                                                                   107\n      HOLLYWOOD.\n\n      Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A\n      matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the\n      passenger window.\n\n      Gary holds up the little bag.\n\n                             GARY\n                   Is this crack?\n\n      She takes a closer look.\n\n                             GARY (CONT'D)\n                   Do you know how to do it?\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n108                                                                   108\n      INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n      Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to\n      bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.\n\n      Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the\n      ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still\n      laughing.\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n109                                                                   109\n      LATER, Octavia is sleeping.\n\n                                                                4.\n\n110                                                                  110\n      INT.

MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n      Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He\n      notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but\n      she's down for the count.\n\n      Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,\n      he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.\n\n                          GARY\n                Yes, hello. I'm having a medical\n                situation. Yes. Okay.

Because if you think about\n                it, you're born with one. So if\n                you don't have one, you're unborn\n                and it's really hazy whether you're\n                alive or not. I guess I'm\n                wondering: am I alive?\n                    (a sudden thought)\n                Or what if I'm God?\n\n      A beat.\n\n                           GARY (CONT'D)\n                No, no.

KITCHEN - DAY\n\n      Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any\n      trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the\n      cabinet.\n\n      Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it\n      down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle.\n\n      He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the\n      recycling.\n\n\n\n155                                                                     155\n      OMIT\n\n                                                                 22.\n\n156                                                                     156\n      INT.

KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n      Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water\n      bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he\n      notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:\n\n                         Look for the Nines.\n\n      He picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n      Gary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to\n      the baby monitor: Sarah is singing a LULLABY. He takes off\n      his shoes and socks.

Then we hear RUSTLING.\n\n      A crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital\n      voice speaks:\n\n                          VOICE\n                The cat says meow!\n                The pig says oink!\n\n      Gary smiles to himself.\n\n                          VOICE (CONT'D)\n                The cow says moo!\n                The cow says moo!\n                The cow says moo!\n\n      Evidently, Jaden loves the cow.\n\n                          VOICE (CONT'D)\n                The dog says, nine.

Yes. Two trains run through\n                   the forest.\n\n       Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression.\n       He nearly drops the phone.\n\n       Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for\n       speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right.\n\n                               MALE COMPUTER VOICE\n                   Nine.    Nine. Nine.

He only catches a glimpse of THE\n       MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is\n       gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.\n\n       Gary bolts for the door.\n\n       Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a\n\n       RAT TRAP,\n\n       which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.\n       He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main\n       floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.\n\n       Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out\n       through the open door.\n\n\nA160                                                                A160\n       EXT.

(\"Some fates are chosen\nfor you.\")\n\nIt's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his\ntoes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here\nfrom the house, which is probably a block away.\n\nThere's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.\n\nOver Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl\n(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter\nto get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.\n\n                     GARY\n          Jesus!

(We recognize her as Octavia, the\nstreetwalker from Part One.)\n\n                         GAVIN\n             I'm fine.\n\n                       OCTAVIA\n             Who were you talking to?\n\nGavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.\n\nMUCH WIDER\n\nWe see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera\nGavin could have been talking to. He's understandably\nperplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?\n\nWas there ever anyone there?\n\nOur CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky,\nwe're smooth and slow.\n\nThe MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of\ncreeping dread.\n\nWe HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little\nunnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.\n\nOnly then do we notice something unusual floating above her\nhead:\n\nA SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.\n\nWIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind\nof sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to\nsee the lights other than Gavin.\n\nGavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just\nlanded on an alien world.\n\nA beat, then he has an unsettling thought.\n\nHe slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same\nsphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.\nBlinding.\n\n                         GAVIN\n             Oh God.\n\n                                                                  66.\n\n       We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind\n       Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing\n       ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by\n       moment.\n\n       A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...\n\n                                   Exit Now?\n                         Unsaved changes will be lost.\n\n                          [ Cancel ]          [ Exit ]\n\n       An arrow slides back and forth between to the two options.\n       Finally it lands on `Exit.'\n\n       A CLICK.\n\n                                                  CUT TO BLACK.\n\n       FADE IN:\n\n\nx177                                                                 x177\n       INT.

You\n          created this world on a whim, and\n          decided to stick around to see how\n          it turned out. You, this body\n          you're in, is just one of your\n          incarnations. Avatars.

MEADOW - DAY\n\n      In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green\n      mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while\n      insects CLICK and WHIRR.\n\n      In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our\n      way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and\n      daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day\n      hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.\n\n      Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...\n\n                            GABRIEL\n                 Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.\n\n      Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her\n      hands in sign language.

SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY\n\n      The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius.\n      Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It\n      won't lift.\n\n      Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked.\n\n                           MARY\n                 Did you hit it?\n\n                           GABRIEL\n                 Shouldn't have to.\n\n                                                             70.\n\nHe fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote\nentry button repeatedly.\n\nGabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even\nNoelle knows something's wrong.\n\nGabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob.\nUnlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and\nNoelle.\n\n                    GABRIEL (CONT'D)\n          I think we left the overhead light\n          on.\n\nHe taps it.   Moves the switch.\n\n                     MARY\n          Shit.\n\nNoelle signs her made-up representation of \"shit.\"\n\n                     MARY (CONT'D)\n          Noelle.\n\nGabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits \"START.\"\nNothing.\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          Battery is dead. Least the starter\n          is.\n\nNoelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.\n\n                    MARY\n          How do we...?\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          We call the service.     That's all we\n          can do.\n\n                    MARY\n          It's just the little battery that's\n          dead, right? The big one is\n          probably fine.\n\n                     GABRIEL\n          I guess.\n\n                    MARY\n          We can't jump it from one battery\n          to the other? Cross-over somehow?\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          Who did you marry?

A long beat.\n\n                       MARY\n          Yes!     One bar.\n\nThey're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,\nGabriel takes the phone and dials.\n\nIt's at this moment we notice the familiar green string\nbracelet around Gabriel's wrist.\n\nIn the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window.   She signs,\nasking if everything is okay.\n\n                    MARY (CONT'D)\n          We're okay. Daddy's calling people\n          to help us.\n\nGabriel pulls the phone from his ear.   Looks at the screen.\nHits redial. Fuck.\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          The minute you try to place a call,\n          the bar goes away.\n\n                    MARY\n          Keep trying.\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But\n          it will keep happening.\n\n                    MARY\n          Well, what do you want to do?\n\n                    GABRIEL\n          I don't know.\n\nHe tries redial.\n\n                    MARY\n          Maybe if you hold it up higher.\n\nHumoring her, he holds it at arm's length.   No good.\n\n                                                                72.\n\n                          GABRIEL\n                The problem is we're boxed in.\n                It's a canyon.\n\n      A beat.\n\n                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)\n                Where we turned off the main road,\n                it was more open. And higher, too.\n\n                          MARY\n                That's at least a mile.\n\n                          GABRIEL\n                I can run that.\n\n                          MARY\n                So...we stay here?\n\n                          GABRIEL\n                You okay with that?\n\n                          MARY\n                I don't think we have a choice, so,\n                yeah. Go.\n\n      Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a\n      better plan. Neither does.\n\n      Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.\n\n                           GABRIEL\n                Daddy's going to get a truck to\n                help us out. You take care of your\n                mom, okay?\n\n      Noelle nods.\n\n                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)\n                I'll be right back.\n\n      Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the\n      road.\n\n      We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.\n\n                                                 CUT TO:\n\n\n303                                                                   303\n      EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY\n\n      Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.    He keeps\n      an easy pace.\n\n      In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's\n      travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.\n\n                                                                 73.\n\n      He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a\n      larger...\n\n\n304                                                                     304\n      EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS]\n\n      Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.\n      By his reaction, it's still iffy.\n\n      He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same.\n\n      He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road.\n\n      He decides to head off to the right, downhill.\n\n\n305                                                                     305\n      EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY\n\n      We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the\n      road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.\n\n      In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female\n      hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:\n\n                             GABRIEL\n                Excuse me!     Hi! Hello?\n\n      She stops, turns.\n\n      Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we\n      reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's \"made a fresh\n      start\" 12 times.

The plan is to\n     shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that\n     involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.\n\n     So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be\n     intercutting the best of all these moments to create one\n     sequence.\n\n\n99                                                                    99\n     INT./EXT.

At first, you just\n               checked in every once in a while.\n               See how the Neanderthals were\n               doing. Move some continents\n               around. But then you got more into\n               it. Starting playing a couple of\n               characters of your own. Kings.\n               Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,\n               you were playing 24/7.\n\n                         G.\n               How long have I..?\n\n                         S.\n               You've been gone for four thousand\n               years. Not that time means the\n               same for us, but...\n\n                         G.\n               You came looking for me.\n\n                         S.\n               That's what a girl does.\n\n                           G.\n               Why now?\n\n                         S.\n               We couldn't just storm in on a\n               fiery chariot. It's your universe.\n               We had to play by your rules. We\n               had to make you see how limited and\n               corrupt your little world was.\n               Don't get me wrong, this world is\n               nice. It's cozy. But do you\n               remember where you came from?\n\n     A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build\n     in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.\n\n                                    98.\n\n          G.\nIt was warm. And white.   Like...\n\n           S.\nYou can't describe it with human\nwords.
