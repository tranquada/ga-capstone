A HYPERBLUE LOS ANGELES SKY -- DAY\n</b>\nThe sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD\nhelicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone.\n\nLAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity\naround a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the\npuckered asshole of Eagle Rock.\n\nA man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house --\n\n<b>                     MALIK'S VOICE\n</b>           I'm gonna kill this dog!  You make my\n           wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this\n           fuckin' dog!\n\nA five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full\nblack assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into\nposition on either side of the front door.  Only now do we\nget the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars\nsurrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the\ntrigger --\n\nWhen the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a\nthumbs-up to --\n\n<b>SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT.

Is that\n           your dog, too?\n\nMalik steps away from the window --\n\n<b>                     MALIK'S VOICE\n</b>           I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied\n           about everything else, so she probably\n           lied about the dog.\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           I know you're hurting.

Why\n           doesn't the bitch say something??? \n\nSomething about Malik's statement bothers Talley.  The\nwording is odd, suspicious --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           George?  Come back to the window.\n\n<b>                     MALIK'S VOICE\n</b><b>           STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!\n</b>\nTalley grows even more concerned.

Leave the dog alone and come to\n           the window.\n\nTalley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY (CONT'D)\n</b>               (to Leifitz)\n           What's the dog's name?\n\n<b>                     LEIFITZ\n</b>           The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.\n\nThe pieces fall into place for Talley:  The wife that no one\ncan find, the dog that doesn't exist....\n\n<b>                     MALIK'S VOICE\n</b><b>           OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR I'M GONNA\n</b><b>           SHOOT THIS DOG!\n</b>\nIn a single terrible moment, Talley realizes that Malik is\nnot talking to him; he's talking to his wife --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           Murray!!  They're in the house!  His\n           wife's in the house!\n\nEven as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house,\nfreezing the moment.  A second shot follows the first as the\ntactical team breaches the front door --\n\nTalley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in\nnightmare slow motion --\n\n<b>INT. MALIK'S HOUSE -- DAY\n</b>\nTalley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team\nthrough drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight.  SWAT cops\nare cuffing Malik even though he's already dead of a self-\ninflicted gunshot wound; Malik's wife is sprawled on the\ncouch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac\nofficers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that\nsprays from the neck of Malik's nine-year-old son even as one\nof them screams for the paramedics --\n\nTalley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible.\nHe kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's\nhand.  He stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares\nback.  The child's face grows pale as he drains of blood.  We\nhear his heart beating.  We hear it slow.  We hear it stop.\n\nTalley stares at the dead boy.  The dead boy's lifeless eyes\nstare at nothing.\n\n<b>TITLES\n</b>\nAnother hyperblue sky, but now we're in an upscale bedroom\ncommunity in the sun-scorched high desert north of LA --\n\nA legend appears:  One Year Later.\n\n<b>EXT. KIM'S MINIMARKET AND GAS STATION -- DAY\n</b>\nA rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the\nminimart, white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies\nwith the engine --\n\nDennis Rooney is driving; twenty-three years old, working-\nclass desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding\ngood looks.  In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared\nshitless at what they're about to do.  Riding shotgun:  Mars\nKrupchek, twenty-four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head\nand faraway eyes.\n\n<b>                     KEVIN\n</b>           C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.

THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT\n</b>\nThe man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average\nlooking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his\nright eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J.\nC. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not\nso much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd\njust by being so ordinary.  That's the point.\n\nA fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with\ncoarse hair, buzzes past --\n\nMarion watches it, only his eyes moving --\n\nThe fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table --\n\nMarion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand\nflashes out, slamming down on the table.\n\nHe holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly\npeeks under his hand --\n\nThe fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One\nwing beats furiously; the other is broken --\n\nMarion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single\nblack leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his\ntongue to the smear --\n\nThe woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening\nwith disgust --\n\nMarion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and\nuses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg,\ntoo --\n\nThe woman disappears into the rear --\n\nHeadlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around\nto see Howell's Mercedes pull up --\n\nMarion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen\nHowell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow\nslip with Talley's address on the table --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL\n</b>           Talley lives here.

The remaining\nwing flutters --\n\nMarion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too.\n\n<b>EXT.

Jennifer stands\nby the chair, arms once more crossed over her breasts. \nKevin can see that she's scared.

Kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the\nchair.  As he ties her, Jennifer decides that if any of them\ncan be reached, it's Kevin --\n\n<b>                     JENNIFER\n</b>           Thanks for the shirt.\n\n<b>                     KEVIN\n</b>           Whatever.\n\n<b>                     JENNIFER\n</b>           Kevin, my father needs a doctor.\n<b>                     \n</b><b>                     KEVIN\n</b>           He's just knocked out.

It's Mars, standing in the\ndoor.  He holds up a wicked claw hammer --\n\n<b>                     MARS\n</b>           Look what I found.\n\nHe enters and tests at Jennifer's binds --\n\n<b>                     MARS (CONT'D)\n</b>           You tied her like a pussy.  Make it\n           tight.\n\nAs Kevin reties the bindings, Mars rips the phone from the\nwall.  He smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing\nit.  Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into\nthe sill, nailing the window closed --\n\nMars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds --\n\n<b>                     MARS (CONT'D)\n</b>           Better.\n\nHe tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her\nmouth --\n\n<b>                     KEVIN\n</b>           Make sure she can breathe.\n\nMars rubs his fingers hard over the tape covering her mouth.\nHe massages the tape into her skin, slow, sensual --\n\n<b>                     MARS\n</b>           Go downstairs, Kevin.\n\nJennifer looks at Kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave,\nbut Kevin is cowed; he leaves --\n\nJennifer looks back at Mars --\n\nMars leans close to her.  She is terrified that he is going\nto kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her --\n\n<b>                     MARS (CONT'D)\n</b>           I want to show you something.\n\nMars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to\nexpose his chest.  A large tattoo in flowing script is lined\nacross his body:  A Mother's Son.\n\n<b>                     MARS (CONT'D)\n</b>           It cost two hundred forty dollars, but I\n           was happy to spend it.  I love my mom.\n           You see these?\n\nMars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if\nhe were diseased.  He fingers the lumps sensuously as if\ntouching them excites him --\n\n<b>                     MARS (CONT'D)\n</b>           My mom burned me with cigarettes.\n\nJennifer is both disgusted and terrified.  Mars stares at her\nemptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves \nwithout another word.\n\n<b>INT. THOMAS'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\nThe room is dark.  Thomas is tied firmly to the bed.  The \ncords cut into Thomas's wrists and Thomas can't reach the\nknots, but Mars made one mistake:  He tied Thomas to the\nheadboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for\nyears --\n\nThomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then\ntwists it back and forth.  He works it harder and harder\nuntil the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is\nfree, though still tied to the newel --\n\nThomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the\nremaining binds and frees himself from the newel.  He slips\noff his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet --\n\n<b>INT. THOMAS'S CLOSET -- NIGHT\n</b>\nA service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built\ninto the wall beneath Thomas's clothes.  Thomas prys open the\nhatch, then reaches inside for a small flashlight.  He flicks \nit on, then climbs into the eaves of the roof --\n\n<b>INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT\n</b>\nThe crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the\nedge of the roof.  It was built for plumbers and air\nconditioning technicians, but Thomas has taken the space for\nhis own:  Witness the stack of Penthouse, pictures of sports\nheroes tacked to the rafters, and old soda cans strewn \nbetween the joists --\n\nThomas scurries quietly through the tunnel, heading for --\n\n<b>INT.

He straps on the vest, then pulls on the sweatshirt.\n\nTalley sits at his desk and lifts out a ballistic nylon\npistol case from the lower drawer.\n\nHe takes out his old SWAT combat piece:  This isn't a pussy\n9mm; it's a finely tuned .45-caliber Colt Model 1911.  One\nshot, one kill.  Talley ejects the empty magazine, then loads\nit with a deadly efficiency.  He slams home the magazine --\n\nTalley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt.

Sheriffs and\nTalley's own officers have gathered at the open rear of the\nambulance to see what all the shouting is about --\n\nKlaus pointedly looks at Talley's hand gripping his arm.  He\nspeaks slowly, trying to make Talley understand --\n\n<b>                     KLAUS\n</b>           I'm not going to wake him.

But now Walter can't talk --\n\nTalley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance --\n\n<b>EXT.

I\n           want to know the second--and I mean the\n           second--that he wakes up.\n\nAs Metzger hurries after the ambulance, a phone in Talley's\npocket rings.  He's startled and scared; it might be the\nWatchman.  Talley takes out the Watchman's white phone, but\nit's not ringing.\n\nHe answers his other phone --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY (CONT'D)\n</b>               (into phone)\n           Talley.\n\n<b>                     ANDERS' VOICE\n</b>           It's me, Chief.

This is\n           their house and their money and they want\n           it back.\n\nThese simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud--\neverything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible\nsense:  You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.\n\nDennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness --\n\n<b>                     DENNIS\n</b>           It ain't been a good day, Chief.\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           Give up, Dennis.

Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes --\n\n<b>                     DREYER\n</b>           What are those, rats?\n\nMikkelson opens the fridge, then slams it, looking like she\nwants to puke --\n\n<b>                     MIKKELSON\n</b>           Ohmigod.

His shoe makes a tacky sound.\n\nThomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before, and\nturns it on.

He\nlets out more light and sees that the oil is red.\n\nThomas knows that something terrible is behind the door, but\nhe is drawn to it.

He hits Jones in the head --\n\nTalley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars\nacross the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns back\nto the burning door and douses the flames with his fire\nextinguisher --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           Thomas!

Where's my family,\n           you fuck?!\n\nAll three men are sucking air like freight engines.

If Talley has the second disk in\nhis pocket, Howell could just shoot him.  But Howell can't be\nsure --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL\n</b>           I have to see if it's real.\n\nHowell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the \ncorner.  He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read.  He's\nsatisfied with what he sees --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL (CONT'D)\n</b>           All right.  Now the second one.\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           First my girls.  I get my girls, you get\n           the other disk.\n\nHowell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL\n</b>               (into the phone)\n           Bring them.  Stop the car outside the\n           room, but don't get out.\n\nThe car pulls up directly outside the door.  It was only\nseconds away.  Marion Clewes is driving; Jane and Amanda are\nwedged into the front seat beside him, Jane next to Marion,\nAmanda on the far side.  They are bound tight with their\nmouths taped, immobile and helpless, their eyes wide with\nfear --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL (CONT'D)\n</b>               (into his phone)\n           Aim your gun at the woman's head.  If he\n           doesn't give me the disk, kill her.\n\nMarion presses a gun to Jane's temple --\n\nTalley jerks his gun toward Howell --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           I'll kill you!

Do you want to lose both of\n           them?\n\nTalley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell.  He\ntried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him\nboxed --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL (CONT'D)\n</b>           The negotiation is over, Talley.  I won.\n           Now give me the disk or he'll put her\n           brain on the glass.\n\nTalley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill.  He\nmouths the words --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           I love you.\n\nHe's saying good-bye.\n\nTalley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles\naway.  Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed.  Manelli\nscoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the\ndoor --\n\n<b>                     TALLEY (CONT'D)\n</b>           I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and\n           they're giving it to the real FBI.

What did you\n           expect me to do?  Pretend all this never\n           happened?\n\nHowell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man\nreading his own death sentence.  There is nothing on this\ndisk.\n\n<b>                     TALLEY (CONT'D)\n</b>           Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want\n           to take my family home.\n\nHowell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL\n</b>           Are you out of your mind?\n\n<b>                     MARION\n</b>               (quietly)\n           You fucked up, Glen.\n\nHowell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and\ngives him the order --\n\n<b>                     HOWELL\n</b>           Kill them.\n\nMarion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then\npoints it at Howell --\n\n<b>                     MARION\n</b>           No fuckups allowed.\n\nMarion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then\nManelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill.\n\nHe lowers his gun, considers Talley.  Talley doesn't\nmove.\n\n<b>                     MARION (CONT'D)\n</b>           It's like a storm, isn't it?  This raging\n           force that you can't control does\n           whatever it wants, and the best you can\n           do is survive.  A winner survives.\n\n<b>                     TALLEY\n</b>           Why...?\n\nThe question being:  Why aren't I dead?  Why aren't you\nkilling me?\n\n<b>                     MARION\n</b>           What good would it do to kill you?

He helps out Jane and Amanda, then\ngets into his car and drives away.\n\n<b>EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- SUNRISE\n</b>\nTalley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family.  He\nscoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera \npulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as\nMarion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead --\n\n<b>CLOSING CREDITS\n</b>\nThe credits roll to black, then--\n\n<b>EXT.
