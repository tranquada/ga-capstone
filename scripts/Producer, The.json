You simply\n            raise more money than you really\n            need.\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            What do you mean?\n\n                         BLOOM\n            You've done it yourself, only you\n            did it on a very small scale.\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            What did I do?\n\n                         BLOOM\n            You raised two thousand more than\n            you needed to produce your last play.\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            So what?  What did it get me?  I'm\n            wearing a cardboard belt.\n\n                         BLOOM\n            Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made\n            your error.  You didn't go all the\n            way.  You see, if you were really a\n            bold criminal, you could have\n            raised a million.\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            But the play only cost $60,000 to\n            produce.\n\n                         BLOOM\n            Exactly.

You could have raised a\n            million dollars, put on a sixty\n            thousand dollar flop and kept the\n            rest.\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            But what if the play was a hit?\n\n                         BLOOM\n            Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play\n            were a hit, you'd have to pay off\n            the backers, and with so many\n            backers there could never be enough\n            profits to go around, get it?\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So,\n            in order for the scheme to work,\n            we'd have to find a sure fire flop.\n\n                         BLOOM\n            What scheme?\n\n                         BIALYSTOCK\n            What scheme?
