A\r\n          broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its\r\n          way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the\r\n                         LEGEND:\r\n                         \r\n           HAWAII, 1941\r\n           SIX MONTHS BEFORE\r\n                          PEARL HARBOR\r\n                         \r\n          The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier\r\n          gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.\r\n          He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward\r\n          camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward\r\n          steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called \"PREW\"\r\n          for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears\r\n          an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where\r\n          chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the\r\n          door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G\r\n          COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.\r\n                         \r\n                         MEDIUM SHOT\r\n          A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs\r\n          out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed\r\n          broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny\r\n          and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his\r\n          face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGID\r\n           Fine way to pass the time.

He comes to the Dayroom, glances\r\n          through the screen door, goes in.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. DAYROOM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n                         MEDIUM SHOT\r\n          The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.\r\n          Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is\r\n          empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool\r\n          table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle\r\n          mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the\r\n          wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT\r\n          The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew\r\n          addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.\r\n          He watches the balls hurry around the table.\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           WARDEN'S VOICE (O.

What's your name?\r\n                         \r\n          The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly.\r\n          CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN,\r\n          almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful,\r\n          has a neatly-trimmed moustache.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Prewitt.

I heard about you.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           I heard about you, too, Warden.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Well, put up that cue and come\r\n           along. This here's a rifle outfit,\r\n           Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy\r\n           yourself before sundown. The Man's\r\n           very particlar about little things\r\n           like that.\r\n                         \r\n          Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and\r\n          follows him.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. COMPANY STREET\r\n                         \r\n                         TRUCKING SHOT\r\n          as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces\r\n          ahead. They go into the Orderly Room.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Maggio is sweeping the room.\r\n          MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First\r\n          Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers,\r\n          etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Mazzioli! Grant went to the\r\n           hospital yesterday. Did you make up\r\n           his sick record? Did you make a\r\n           note for the morning report?!\r\n           You're the Compny Clerk.

I already done it for you.\r\n                         \r\n                         ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n          Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,\r\n          stares at the other man as if still incredulous.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           But you the beat bugler they got\r\n           over at Shatter. You probly the\r\n           best on this whole Rock.\r\n                         \r\n          In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at\r\n          Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           That's true.\r\n                         \r\n          Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper\r\n          basket.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Well, friend, I feel for you. But\r\n           from my position I can't quite\r\n           reach you.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Ten-sh-HUT!\r\n                         \r\n          Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen\r\n          door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears\r\n          cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of\r\n          himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods\r\n          pleasantly.\r\n                         \r\n                          HOLMES\r\n           At ease.

Warden jerks his thumb toward\r\n          the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter. A\r\n          placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby\r\n          has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats\r\n          himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of\r\n          prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On\r\n          Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very\r\n          attractive blonde woman. Prewitt comes to attention in front\r\n          of Holmes' desk.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREWITT\r\n           Sir, Private Robert E.

Karen shakes away, rises,\r\n          faces him.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           You had a way of knowing, Dana. I\r\n           want to go to bed.

There is a moment of silence,\r\n          then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two.\r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Warden is reading a\r\n          newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads:\r\n          JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap,\r\n          looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully.\r\n                         \r\n          FULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE\r\n          Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool.\r\n          Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and\r\n          tolerance.

They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man\r\n          weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his\r\n          eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as\r\n          an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian;\r\n          HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good-\r\n          looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a\r\n          Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching\r\n          with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots\r\n          and misses.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHOATE\r\n           I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight.\r\n                         \r\n          Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Man, what I would not give to have\r\n           this character in the corner\r\n           poolroom in my home town: I'd dress\r\n           him up on overhalls and a straw hat\r\n           and put a grass in his teeth, and I\r\n           would make a whole mint of ghelt\r\n           off him!\r\n                         \r\n          Choate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot.\r\n                         \r\n                          WILSON\r\n           We'd of won last year if we had a\r\n           good middleweight.

Over shot the sound of a\r\n          bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished\r\n          in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on\r\n          adjoining bunks, smoking.

In my position you have to.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           (goes to sink, picks up\r\n                          THE PAPERS)\r\n           Are these really important?\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Yes. But not important they get\r\n           signed today. Tomorrow's okay.\r\n                         \r\n          Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. Then\r\n          she tears them into bits and throws them into the\r\n          wastebasket. Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the\r\n          first time. He grins widely.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I got carbons of those back at the\r\n           office. So it won't be much work to\r\n           fix them up.\r\n                         \r\n          Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now. She is\r\n          losing her poise.\r\n           29.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           That's what I like about you,\r\n           Sergeant. You have confidence. It's\r\n           also what I dislike about you.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           It's not confidence. It's honesty.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Honesty? How did you acquire such\r\n           an old-fashioned virtue?\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I figgered out one day it was the\r\n           shortest distance between two\r\n           points.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Well, he's clever as well as\r\n           virile.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           No -- it's just that I hate to see\r\n           a beautiful woman goin all to\r\n           waste.\r\n                         \r\n          He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her.\r\n          Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. During\r\n          next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her\r\n          hand. Her tone is no longer brittle. It is bitter.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Waste, did you say? Now that's a\r\n           subject I might tell you something\r\n           about. There's we. And then there's\r\n           waste. Positive and negative. The\r\n           negative is sometimes more\r\n           interesting... more evil. For\r\n           example -- what about the house\r\n           without a child? Tell me your\r\n           thoughts, Sergeant.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           You're going to cry.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Not if I can help it.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Please don't cry... I can't stand\r\n           to see somebody cry.\r\n           30.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about\r\n          to put it on.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           What are you doing?\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I'm leaving. Isn't that what you\r\n           want?\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n                          (SLOWLY)\r\n           I don't know, Sergeant. To be\r\n           honest, I don't know.\r\n                         \r\n          They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little\r\n          afraid of their emotions. This is something neither had\r\n          counted on.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I know a beach near Diamond Head.\r\n           Nobody ever goes there. The cars on\r\n           the highway pass above and they\r\n           never know it's there. You feel\r\n           like you used to feel when you were\r\n           a kid, hiding by yourself in a\r\n           cave, watching the others hunting\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n          Karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in\r\n          the cabinet.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Maybe... why not?\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           How about Payday?\r\n                         \r\n          Karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure. She is\r\n          unsmiling again.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           You don't have to spend money on\r\n           me, Sergeant.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I just like to have some on me when\r\n           I take out a woman. Can you get\r\n           away?\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Maybe.\r\n           31.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. He goes to the door\r\n          to the pantry, pauses there.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine\r\n           o'clock. Payday.\r\n                         \r\n          Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the\r\n          pantry. A moment later the sound of the door is heard as he\r\n          leaves the house. She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse,\r\n          the glasses they have used. Suddenly she turns the faucet on\r\n          full force, watches it pound into the sink.\r\n                         \r\n           FADE OUT.\r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Mingling with the background shots\r\n          are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the\r\n          sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way\r\n          to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear\r\n          stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for\r\n          the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by\r\n          MUSIC.

As he does, PRIVATE\r\n          WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile\r\n          of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully.

Maggio is\r\n          handing some bills to ANNETTE, a young, brash-looking girl,\r\n          who sits behind a reception desk.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Okay... so there y'are. Dues all\r\n           paid up. Who ya got playin the\r\n           piana -- a hippo?\r\n                         \r\n           MRS. KIPPER\r\n           Angelo, I don't believe I've met\r\n           your friend. And you know how I\r\n           hate to find you boys in this\r\n           condition...\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           There. You see. Any time women see\r\n           a soldier, think he's drunk. Why?\r\n           You know why?\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Because he is.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS. KIPPER\r\n           Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix\r\n           with the entertainment business.\r\n           Every respectable place must\r\n           consider its future.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, I give you my\r\n           solemn word your future will be\r\n           safe with us.\r\n           40.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Maggio nods vigorously in agreement, then pushes through the\r\n          heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room\r\n          beyond. Mrs. Kipfer looks after him a little unhappily.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS. KIPPER\r\n           Angelo is one of my favorites.\r\n           Annette, dear, take care of this\r\n           gentleman, will you, please?\r\n                         \r\n          Mrs. Kipfer exits through the curtains. Annette takes a card\r\n          from file, picks up pen.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           It'll be eight bucks, Babyface.\r\n           Four for initiation fee, four for\r\n           April dues.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Say, what do I get for it?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           (rattling it off)\r\n           Members are entitled to all\r\n           privileges of the club which\r\n           includes dancing, snack bar, soft\r\n           drink bar, and gentlemanly\r\n           relaxation with the opposite gender\r\n           so long as they are gentlemen and\r\n           no hard liquor is permitted.\r\n           (takes a breath)\r\n           Got it?\r\n                         \r\n          Prew grins, digs in his pocket for money.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           I got it.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - LARGE CLUB ROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n                         FULL SHOT\r\n          Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about\r\n          a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen\r\n          hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano\r\n          is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a\r\n          jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs.\r\n          Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy\r\n          themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a\r\n          place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of\r\n          prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all\r\n          but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a\r\n          couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look\r\n          about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low\r\n          on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a\r\n           41.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          magazine, untouched by the din around her.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT \"FATSO\" JUDSON\r\n          pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out.\r\n          He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles\r\n          Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced\r\n          far apart on a great white plate.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE\r\n          Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very\r\n          tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the\r\n          langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps\r\n          switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of\r\n          the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance\r\n          out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule.\r\n          CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           ... Girls, here's some new poison.\r\n           This is Billy and Jean and Nancy.\r\n                         \r\n          The girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the\r\n          girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV\r\n          As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from\r\n          the magazine, smiles serenely across the room.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW AND ANNETTE\r\n          as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene. He seems\r\n          transfixed.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           Don't tell me the Princess is your\r\n           style.\r\n                         \r\n          Annette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good-\r\n          looking girls talking to a soldier.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           Meet Suzanne and Roxanne.\r\n                         \r\n          The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over\r\n          his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with\r\n          haughty disdain.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNETTE\r\n           Much as I adore your company, you\r\n           must allow me to tear myself away.\r\n           I see a few friends at the door.\r\n                          (SNAPS)\r\n           Also I can see I will be of no use\r\n           to you much.\r\n           42.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          She walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier.\r\n          Prew continues to gaze across the room.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE\r\n          smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is\r\n          coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before\r\n          her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low-\r\n          pitched, poised.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n           Would you like to sit down?\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n                          (SITTING)\r\n           Oh... sure.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n           I'm Lorene.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           (enchanted by the name)\r\n           Lorene...\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n           I haven't seen you in here before.\r\n                         \r\n          Prew gestures with the membership card.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           I dint know about this place till\r\n           now.

A group of man and\r\n          girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing\r\n          and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio.\r\n          Prew looks over, concerned.\r\n                         \r\n                          FATSO'S VOICE\r\n           I'll play loud as I want, ya little\r\n           Wop!\r\n                         \r\n          A babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Friend of mine.\r\n                          (RISES)\r\n           You wait right here for me, will\r\n           ya?\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n                          (SMILES SWEETLY)\r\n           Surely.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO\r\n          where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are\r\n          restraining Maggio.

We hear soft\r\n          chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several\r\n          moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate\r\n          laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch,\r\n          their heads close together as if they have just kissed\r\n          pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is\r\n          on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender\r\n          feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g.\r\n          A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around\r\n          Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with\r\n          something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no\r\n          effort now to be \"the Princess.\" She speaks as if resuming a\r\n          conversation.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n           ... I enlisted, too. I came out\r\n           here on my own. To get away from my\r\n           home town. In Oregon.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           How come?\r\n                         \r\n                          LORENE\r\n           I had a boy friend. I was a\r\n           waitress. He was from the richest\r\n           family in town. He just married the\r\n           girl suitable for his position.\r\n           After three years of going around\r\n           with me.\r\n                          (PAUSE)\r\n           It's a pretty story, isn't it?\r\n           Maybe they could make a movie of\r\n           it.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           They did.

And I met a girl just\r\n           back from Hawaii. She said she'd\r\n           made a lot of money working for\r\n           Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first\r\n           boat.

After a moment,\r\n          Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is\r\n          grinning like an amateur conspirator.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           I dint hear no sounds of combat.

Only he was a\r\n           First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort\r\n           Bliss. We lived right on a little\r\n           lake where we could fish and swim\r\n           and be alone, our 'dream\r\n           cottage'... I'm sure you must be\r\n           able to picture it. It was off on a\r\n           back road, four miles from the\r\n           highway. Two miles from a neighbor\r\n           and a telephone....\r\n           (pauses, then rushes on)\r\n           I hadn't been married long when\r\n           I knew my husband was stepping\r\n           out on me. But -- you get used\r\n           to that. Your mother tells you\r\n           that it's life, that i t happens\r\n           to a lot of women. Of course,\r\n           she doesn't tell you until after\r\n           it happens.\r\n                         \r\n          ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN\r\n          reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           Then, by that time, you're\r\n           pregnant. And at least you've\r\n           something else to hope for. I think\r\n           I was almost happy that night the\r\n           pains began. Even though they were\r\n           weeks too early, a whole month too\r\n           early. I remember Dana was putting\r\n           on that dapper silk gabardine\r\n           uniform he used to wear. He was\r\n           going to an officer's 'seminar.' He\r\n           was kidding me about false labor. I\r\n           didn't think it was humorous. I\r\n           told him to get home early, to\r\n           bring the doctor with him. He\r\n           smiled tenderly and told me about\r\n           the psychic reactions of women to\r\n           pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be\r\n           back early. And maybe he would\r\n           have... if the 'seminar' hadn't\r\n           been with the hat-check girl in one\r\n           of the night clubs.\r\n           59.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Listen.\r\n                         \r\n                         TWO SHOT\r\n                         \r\n                          KAREN\r\n           He was only a little drunk when he\r\n           came in... at five a.m. He looked\r\n           alarmed when he saw me. I guess it\r\n           was because of my screams. I was\r\n           lying there on the floor, you see --\r\n           No, don't say anything. I'm not\r\n           finished yet. Of course, the baby\r\n           was dead. It was a boy. But they\r\n           worked over me at the hospital and\r\n           fixed me up fine. They even took my\r\n           appendix out, too. They threw that\r\n           in free. It was all fine.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Listen. Listen.

He writes down the words of the song as they are\r\n          composed during following.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           How's this?

On\r\n          the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of\r\n          the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center\r\n          of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes\r\n          hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW\r\n          He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor.\r\n          There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above\r\n          his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope.\r\n          In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE\r\n           Some day you get sense in your dumb\r\n           head, Prewitt, you be up here\r\n           instead down there!\r\n                         \r\n          A fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over\r\n          Prew but he keeps about his work.\r\n                         \r\n                          WILSON\r\n           Still makin out you like it, huh?\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT IN RING\r\n          There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one\r\n          of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty\r\n          water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH\r\n           Clean up dis mess, Prewitt!\r\n                         \r\n          Prew gets to his feet.

You\r\n           on fatigue detail, not vacation.\r\n                         \r\n          Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab\r\n          up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch\r\n          \"accidentally\" kicks over the second bucket.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH\r\n           Clean up, Prewitt!\r\n                         \r\n          Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage.

He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's\r\n          bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's\r\n          heels.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH\r\n           Move along.

Sitting next to him is\r\n          MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and\r\n          Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the\r\n          vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of\r\n          the two men.\r\n                         \r\n                          GENERAL SLATER\r\n           At ease.

Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his\r\n          face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He\r\n          has regained his old expressionless look.

The place is crowded with men from\r\n          Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer\r\n          and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door\r\n          sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli.

The blade is at least five inches long. It\r\n          glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking\r\n          intake of breath from the room.

He brandishes a beer bottle\r\n          wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.\r\n           73.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Nobody's gunna do nothin!

He steps between Fatso and Maggio.\r\n                         \r\n                          FATSO\r\n           Look outs here, Warden.

Put that knife down!\r\n                         \r\n          He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the\r\n          wagged edge at Fatso, roars:\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Put it down!\r\n                         \r\n          Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it\r\n          pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns\r\n          his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on,\r\n           you want some killing, come on!\r\n           (whirls on Fatso)\r\n           Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you\r\n           comin?\r\n                         \r\n          Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           (with mammoth contempt)\r\n           Killers! You'll get plenty of\r\n           killing, all right. More than you\r\n           got the stomach for. You'll be in a\r\n           war one of these days. When you\r\n           feel that lead from a sniper's\r\n           rifle hit you between the eyes,\r\n           come and tell me how you like it.\r\n           Killers!\r\n           (turns to Maggio)\r\n           Now put down that chair.\r\n                         \r\n          Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso.\r\n           74.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Throw that knife on the floor.\r\n                         \r\n          Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is\r\n          another audible whoosh of breath from the room.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Almost scared there wasn't anybody\r\n           going to stop you for a minute,\r\n           weren't you?\r\n           (finally lowers his voice)\r\n           Is there any other little things\r\n           you punks'd like me to take care of\r\n           for you?\r\n                         \r\n          He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his\r\n          own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has\r\n          broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing\r\n          Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.\r\n                         \r\n                          FATSO\r\n           Tough monkey.

I'll show you a\r\n           coupla things.\r\n                         \r\n          He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE\r\n          Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied\r\n          as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises\r\n          his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE\r\n          Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He\r\n          half-whispers to Prew.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           I made a mistake I guess, but I\r\n           don't see how I could of done\r\n           anything else, after that big stoop\r\n           said a thing like that.\r\n                         \r\n          Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          PHEW\r\n           I'll tell you your mistake. You\r\n           didn't hit him hard enough to put\r\n           him out.\r\n           75.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           I hit him hard as I could. His head\r\n           must be solid ivory.\r\n                         \r\n          In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards\r\n          the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it.\r\n           He's a good man, you know it?\r\n                         \r\n          As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n                         MEDIUM SHOT\r\n          as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the\r\n          entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him\r\n          off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to\r\n          him.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN\r\n          leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction\r\n          to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating\r\n          heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT PREW\r\n          astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence\r\n          and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           ...

Warden is beginning to get\r\n          control of himself; he manages a weak smile.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           You keep it, kid.

They stare at one another\r\n          a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express\r\n          some deep emotion of respect.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           You ain't enjoying life much, are\r\n           you, kid?\r\n           76.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n                          (THIN SMILE)\r\n           They can kill you but they can't\r\n           eat you, Top.\r\n                         \r\n          Warden studies Prew thoughtfully.

Maggio is shouting, \"Can't a man do\r\n          nothin?!\" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other,\r\n          directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers\r\n          back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the\r\n          latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but\r\n          instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly.\r\n          In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The\r\n          first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club\r\n          and hits the first MP over the head.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW\r\n          Horrified, he starts toward the fracas.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G.\r\n          The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He\r\n          smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues\r\n          to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them.\r\n           85.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Get back!

He stops, breathing hard.\r\n          The sound of the MPs fighting with Maggio can be heard, the\r\n          ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing\r\n          bone and flesh.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO'S VOICE\r\n           (screaming, crazed)\r\n           Come on.

CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSEUP of\r\n          Prew on the ground, his face contorted. The voices of the MPs\r\n          are heard now, panting.\r\n                         \r\n           FIRST MP'S VOICE\r\n           I wonder what was wrong with this\r\n           guy.

Prew sits\r\n          on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees,\r\n          chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden\r\n          looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board.\r\n          Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a\r\n          window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy\r\n          bar.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVA\r\n           Any word on Maggio's Court Martial?\r\n                         \r\n                          MAZZIOLI\r\n           It's on right now. At Headquarters.\r\n                         \r\n          Lava sits on the bench beside Prew, shakes his head.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVA\r\n           He'll get the Stockade sure.\r\n                         \r\n          The others tense at the word \"Stockade,\" glare at Leva as if\r\n          he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now\r\n          that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on\r\n          their faces. There is a long pause.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAZZIOLI\r\n           Maybe he won't get it. All he did\r\n           was get drunk and run wild. That's\r\n           a soldier's nature. It's almost his\r\n           sacred duty once in a while.\r\n                         \r\n          There is another pause. Warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at\r\n          Leva.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           What you hangin around here for?\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVA\r\n           Can't a man rest himself for a min--\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           What man?

Warden goes over to Prew.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n           Whyn't you go on over to the Day\r\n           Room, shoot a little pool?\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           87.\r\n                          WARDEN(CONT'D)\r\n           I'll let you know when the word\r\n           comes through.\r\n                         \r\n          Prew looks up, nods, rises. He is half-way to the door when\r\n          the phone at the Clerk's desk rings. Prew turns. Mazzioli\r\n          stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it. Warden goes\r\n          over, answers.\r\n                         \r\n                          WARDEN\r\n                          (ON PHONE)\r\n           Compny G, First Sergeant Warden\r\n           speaking...

The G\r\n          Company men cluster around the car, ad-libbing greetings,\r\n          kidding Maggio, bucking him up. Even the Sergeants join in\r\n          this; nobody likes to see a man on his way to the Stockade.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAGGIO\r\n           Hello, men!

He looks\r\n          down at Prew, full of venom.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH\r\n           Still on knees, eh, Prewitt?

Controlling himself, he weeds\r\n          around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE\r\n           Are proud dis Compny to be or not?\r\n           Bites de hand dat feeds it der\r\n           shoot dogs for.

Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book\r\n          and comes over to them during following.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           Get outa my way, Ike.

Maybe I give to you myself.\r\n           Maybe right now.\r\n                         \r\n          He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy\r\n          shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill\r\n          steps between them.\r\n                         \r\n                          THORNHILL\r\n                          (TO GALOVITCH)\r\n           Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my\r\n                          DETAIL --\r\n                         \r\n          Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He\r\n          starts unbuttoning his shirt.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n                          (TO GALOVITCH)\r\n           All right. It's gonna be your way.\r\n                         \r\n          Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as\r\n          he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to\r\n          change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize\r\n          fighter.\r\n                         \r\n                          THORNHILL\r\n           Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- !\r\n                         \r\n          Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch\r\n          charges him.\r\n                         \r\n          VARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS\r\n          During following men run from across the quadrangle and from\r\n          out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around\r\n           107.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around\r\n          Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering\r\n          but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times.\r\n          Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never\r\n          throws a punch at the other's head.\r\n                         \r\n                          NAIR\r\n           The head, Prew! Hit him in the\r\n           head!\r\n                         \r\n          The other men around shout similar advice.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT GALOVITCH\r\n          puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts\r\n          of the men. He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a\r\n          trick.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT PREW\r\n          A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as\r\n          he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the\r\n          memory of Dixie Wells.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES\r\n                         \r\n                         CLOSEUP PREW\r\n          flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the\r\n          other's eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH\r\n          fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye.\r\n          He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill\r\n          breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR\r\n                         \r\n                          SPECTATOR\r\n           I don't get it -- Why don't Prew go\r\n           for the head?\r\n                         \r\n                          DHOM\r\n           He blinded a guy once.

A right to\r\n          the temple sends him to his knees. He shakes his head a\r\n          moment, gets up and goes into a clinch.\r\n                         \r\n          LONG SHOT BARRACKS WINDOWS ON UPPER FLOORS\r\n          The windows are crowded with men watching the fight.\r\n           108.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Thornhill runs\r\n          into the office, breathless. He comes to a shaking attention\r\n          as he sees Holmes.\r\n                         \r\n                          HOLMES\r\n           At ease, Sergeant.

Warden jumps up, starts\r\n          for door. Holmes catches his arm.\r\n           109.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          HOLMES\r\n           There's no rush.

The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs.\r\n          Warden walks to his desk, stares down at the application\r\n          form, picks it up. He carries it over to Holmes' desk. He\r\n          looks at the picture of Karen on the desk.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT PHOTOGRAPH OF KAREN\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN\r\n          He stares at the picture, then looks at the application\r\n          blank. Then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm. He rubs\r\n          his hand over the chevrons gently, fondly. He looks at the\r\n          application blank again very thoughtfully.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Prew is tiring, his face is cut\r\n          and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is\r\n          unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his\r\n          stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s\r\n          tactics.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS\r\n          FEATURING the non-\"ath-a-leets\" of G Company, including\r\n          Anderson, Clark and Treadwell. Ad-libbed shouts of \"In the\r\n          face, Prew! In the face!\"\r\n                         \r\n                         ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n          FEATURING the \"ath-a-loots,\" including Dhom, Wilson and\r\n          Henderson. They are watching quietly, nodding with approval\r\n          as Prew feints, then darts several punches into Galovitch's\r\n          ribs, It almost seems as if they are admiring Prew's courage,\r\n          inwardly rooting for him. Holmes enters the group, Thornhill\r\n          tagging after him. Holmes stops and watches the fight. There\r\n          is a look of satisfaction on his face.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH\r\n          The fight continuing.\r\n           110.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n          near rear of crowd. An officer, walking across the lawn, is\r\n          attracted by the noise. He steps into the crowd. This is\r\n          COLONEL WILLIAMS. He wears the insignia of the Inspector\r\n          General's Department. He watches the fight, is about to step\r\n          through to break it up when he sees Holmes. He stops, watches\r\n          Holmes' reactions.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH\r\n          Prew, backed up against the crowd, trips over somebody's\r\n          feet. He falls without being hit. Galovitch kicks at him and\r\n          Prew rolls away. The crowd murmurs angrily. Sergeant Stark\r\n          steps out into the open circle, faces Galovitch.\r\n                         \r\n                          STARK\r\n           This ain't no rassle, Ike. You got\r\n           to fight this man fair.\r\n                         \r\n          Approving shouts from the crowd. Stark steps back. Ike waits\r\n          for Prew to get up.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW\r\n          looking up at Galovitch.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH SHOOTING UP FROM PREW'S POV\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES\r\n                         \r\n                         CLOSEUP PREW\r\n          His eyes narrow, harden as if his inner struggle has been\r\n          resolved.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH\r\n          Prew gets to his feet. As Galovitch comes to him, Prew feints\r\n          for the stomach, then throws a hard right to Galovitch's\r\n          face. It hits him flush on the nose. Blood spurts. The crowd\r\n          roars.\r\n                         \r\n                         ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n          Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands. Prew\r\n          drives both fists to his solar plexus. Galovitch drops his\r\n          guard. Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple.\r\n          Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking.\r\n                         \r\n          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH\r\n          The whole nature of the fight has changed.

Then Prew and Warden jump up and catch him as he\r\n          is about to fall. The drunkenness drains out of them.

Some prop up on their elbows.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT CHOATE\r\n          as he listens.

He is working\r\n          late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him. He listens to\r\n          the bugle call, moved, sorrowful. He snaps off the light,\r\n          listens in the darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless.\r\n          The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone\r\n          for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes\r\n          reverberating across the silent quadrangle.\r\n           123.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

They are\r\n          standing in no particular places, as if they have been\r\n          walking and stopped suddenly. They are all looking toward the\r\n          Bugler.\r\n           124.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He withdraws the mouthpiece, puts it in his\r\n          pocket. He hands the bugle to Clark. Clark looks at the\r\n          instrument as if it has become hallowed. Prew walks off into\r\n          the darkness.\r\n                         \r\n           FADE OUT.\r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

CAMERA PANS AND INCLUDES Prew, leaning\r\n          against the building. He is watching the entrance to the Club\r\n          patiently. There is relentless hatred on his face. The music\r\n          stops. Prew does not move.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He moves toward Prew, who steps swiftly to one side.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           I kinds thought you'd try that.\r\n                         \r\n          There is the same sound as Prew pulls a knife from his\r\n          pocket, snaps it open, holds it out flat in his hand, showing\r\n          it to Fatso.\r\n                         \r\n                          PREW\r\n           This here's the one you pulled on\r\n           Maggio once. Reconize it?\r\n                         \r\n          Fatso darts at Prew, knife raised. Prew moves back, but Fatso\r\n          is on him and they both roll to one side along the building.\r\n          The movement throws them deep into the shadows.\r\n                         \r\n          ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS\r\n          The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional\r\n          silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go\r\n          deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a\r\n          startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his\r\n          knees and starts to crawl toward camera.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND\r\n          as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the\r\n          anguished face of Fatso.

Prew staggers into the light now. His left\r\n          side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares\r\n          down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice.\r\n                         \r\n                          FATSO\r\n           You've killed me.

He stops close to camera. He wads his\r\n          handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife\r\n          wound.

These findings are the\r\n           result of personal investigation by\r\n           the Inspector General and are\r\n           corroborated by numerous members of\r\n           G Company.\r\n                         \r\n          Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk.\r\n          Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he\r\n          has really expected something like this for a long time. He\r\n          makes no move to speak.

It\r\n           seems to be the first thing you\r\n           forgot. It's monstrous to think of\r\n           anybody like you in command of\r\n           troops. And believe me, you won't\r\n           be for long.

Any way...\r\n                         \r\n          The General frowns, is unresponsive.

She stops after a\r\n          sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on\r\n          the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his\r\n          head, emotionally bewildered. For perhaps the first time in\r\n          his life he is nakedly honest.\r\n           131.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          HOLMES\r\n           Where has it gone, Karen?

We hear Ross'\r\n          first few words over this, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM\r\n          SHOT. Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of\r\n          toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the\r\n          photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the\r\n          wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill,\r\n          Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross\r\n          is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost\r\n          unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their\r\n          expressions.

Warden whips out a\r\n          handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet.\r\n                         \r\n                         MEDIUM SHOT\r\n          Some of the men continue to crane at the sky.

He takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs, hastily\r\n          downs a swig of coffee. Then he throws the plate and cup into\r\n          the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise\r\n          of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead.\r\n           140.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

In b.g. the Jap V has swung about\r\n          and heads back.
