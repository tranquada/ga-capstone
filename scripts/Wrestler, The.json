Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN\n          THE HEAD. Randy goes down.\n          \n          Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest-\n          to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.\n          \n          Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back,\n          presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a\n          LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams\n          down on his back.\n          \n          As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE\n          TURNBUCKLE.\n          \n          RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded\n          cover.\n          \n          Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the\n          waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE.

He picks up him by the hair and\n          drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the\n          exposed metal post beneath.\n          \n          Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade\n          along his hairline. No one sees it happen.\n          \n          BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.\n          \n          Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again.\n          Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts\n          around the ring.\n          \n                              KID LOCO\n                    Look at this loser! How pathetic.\n          \n          ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look\n          comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the\n          Hulk.\n          \n          Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for\n          another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm\n          muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super-\n          charged.\n          \n          A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is\n          about to turn.\n          \n          Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the\n          hair. He pulls him in close.\n          \n                              RANDY\n                        (under breath)\n                    Let's go home.\n          \n          Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage\n          he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.\n          \n          Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks\n          down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas\n          as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE\n          DOWN with his feet over the ropes.\n          \n          Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his\n          knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.\n          \n          Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.\n          He scurries away. Randy goes after him.\n          \n          Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks.\n          Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.\n          \n          Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks\n          out at the crowd.\n          \n                                                                  17.\n          \n          \n          RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.\n          \n                                TRIO\n                      Ram Jam!

RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...\n          \n          Randy \"mulls\" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks\n          at the corner. He heads for the corner.\n          \n          Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd\n          like he's still undecided.\n          \n          RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.\n          \n          Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his\n          head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening\n          montage.)\n          \n          He LEAPS.\n          \n          The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down\n          onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.\n          \n          The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam.

They take turns punching each other, each shot a\n          little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of\n          \"slaps\".\n          \n          After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his\n          sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in\n          Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around\n          the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head\n          with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal\n          reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.\n          Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube\n          explodes with a pop.\n          \n          Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward\n          Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie\n          board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS\n          OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent\n          jolt as the chair hits the mat.\n          \n          Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an\n          aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the\n          face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC\n          CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.\n          \n                                                                     31.\n          \n          \n          Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.\n          \n          He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the\n          ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's\n          awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and\n          crashes into Randy knee-first.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his\n          face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM\n          OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the\n          concrete floor.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding\n          chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles\n          backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the\n          fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips\n          over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an\n          exhilarated panic.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.\n          Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.\n          \n          Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.\n          \n          Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly\n          Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN\n          and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square\n          in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.\n          \n          Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,\n          showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head\n          into the can and falls on it, ass-first.\n          \n          Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He\n          POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.\n          \n          With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to\n          his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling\n          around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off\n          the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,\n          carrying the ladder in his other hand.\n          \n          Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up\n          the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and\n          grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He\n          reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF\n          THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder\n          with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the\n          table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy\n          surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is\n          caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy\n          grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.\n          \n                                                                   32.\n          \n          \n          In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly\n          Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back\n          bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.\n          Randy hits him with a dropkick.\n          \n          Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.\n          \n          Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up\n          for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his\n          face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.\n          \n          Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching\n          his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at\n          the air.\n          \n          RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They\n          assume it's part of the act.\n          \n          Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He\n          knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.\n          \n                              HELLBILLY CANNIBAL\n                    Is there a doctor?\n          \n          Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.\n          \n          Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's\n          promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy.\n          \n                              JERRY DIFUSCO\n                    Randy. You okay?\n          \n          Randy is gasping.

They carry him to the\n          ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through.\n          \n                              LEX LETHAL\n                    Put him down.\n          \n          They lower him to the mat.

They surge forward\n          as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.\n          \n                              JERRY DIFUSCO\n                    Get back, get back, get back.\n          \n          \n          INT.

By 1993, I was five-foot-\n                    eleven. Three back surgeries in 11\n                    years knocked two full inches off\n                    my height. I may be down to five-\n                    eleven, but performing in front of\n                    you people has always made me feel\n                    10 feet tall. And that's the way\n                    it's always gonna be.\n          \n          Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the\n          entrance curtain.

The fans CHEER WILDLY, the\n          loudest cheers yet.\n          \n          As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah\n          SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair.\n          \n          Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but\n          he doesn't hear them.\n          \n          The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The\n          match is on.\n          \n          The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.\n          Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up\n          an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead\n          his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up\n          and grabs The Ayatollah.\n          \n          The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes\n          again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for\n          Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.\n          \n                                                                  112.\n          \n          \n                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n                          (under breath)\n                      You're workin' pretty light here.\n          \n          Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty\n          move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM\n          HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The\n          Ayatollah's face into the canvas.\n          \n                                THE AYATOLLAH\n                      Jesus. Relax.\n          \n          Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his\n          shoulder blades.

The Ayatollah jogs\n          toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something\n          good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The\n          Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.\n          \n                                RANDY\n                      Anytime you wanna join in.\n          \n          Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee\n          with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits\n          the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him\n          with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.\n          \n          The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.\n          \n          Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his\n          ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending\n          Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The\n          Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds\n          Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him.\n          \n          \n          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:\n          \n          Cassidy is cringing.

The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him\n          in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee.\n          Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah\n          falls on top of him.\n          \n                                 THE AYATOLLAH\n                       Forgot how much fun this is.\n          \n          The ref swoops in.\n          \n                                 REFEREE\n                       One!...

He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the\n          chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and\n          OUT OF THE RING.
