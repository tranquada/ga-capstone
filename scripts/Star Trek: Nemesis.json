The biological pulse\nfinding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of\nscience.\n\nCREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical\ntechnology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying\nand gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy\nof exploding flowers.

In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures\nlean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones\ndenote the gravity of their discussion.\n\nWe can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they\nare talking about.\n\nThe three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.

ROMULUS - SUNSET\n</b>\nThe sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan\nStar Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of\nthis bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the\nhorizon.\n\nWe slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the\ncity.  The Romulan Senate chamber.\n\n<b>INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET\n</b>\nSENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look\nof bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan\ncrest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious\nbird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.\n\nAnd then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...\n\nPRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --\npresiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a\ncapable politician in his 50s.\n\n<b>                     SENATOR 1\n</b>          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose\n          this important source of dilithium.\n          A trade agreement is in the best\n          interests of the Empire.\n\n<b>                     SENATOR 2\n</b>          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a\n          diplomatic mission to Celes II to\n          open negotiations.\n\nSenator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word \"negotiations.\"\nPraetor Hiren glances to her.\n\n<b>                     PRAETOR\n</b>          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with\n          the motion.\n\n<b>                     TAL'AURA\n</b>          No, sir.

Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...\nbut she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,\nsilver box with unusual etchings on the surface.\n\nThe discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...\n\n<b>                     PRAETOR\n</b>          Then I will call for a vote on the\n          motion to open trade negotiations\n          with Celes II...\n\nThe Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The\nsilver box is moving.\n\nThe Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold\nopen.  Then \"legs\" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,\nstanding on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The\nSenator looks at it, puzzled.\n\nSuddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the\nspider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the\nhigh domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around\nthe interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing\nshroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.\n\nAnd then just as suddenly the light disappears.\n\nA moment of silence.

Flesh\nmelts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every\nliving thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.\n\nA stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then\na transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It\ndisappears.\n\nAnd the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...\n\n<b>EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY\n</b>\nJEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in\nStarfleet.\n\nHis face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress\nuniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.\n\nHe looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been\nthe watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          Duty...\n\nHe lets the word resonate and then continues.\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          A starship captain's life is filled\n          with solemn duty.  I have commanded\n          men in battle.  I have negotiated\n          peace treaties between implacable\n          enemies.  I have represented the\n          Federation in first contact with\n          twenty-seven alien species.  But\n          none of this compares to my solemn\n          duty as... Best man.\n\nUproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding\nreception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.\n\nThe Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some\nfrom other \"Star Trek\" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the\ncenter of a long table.\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          Now, I know that on an occasion\n          such as this: it is expected that I\n          be gracious and fulsome with praise\n          on the wonders of this blessed\n          union... But have you two\n          considered what you're doing to?\n          This is all a damned\n          inconvenience...\n               (laughter from the crowd)\n          While you're happily settling in on\n          the Titan, I'll have to train a new\n          first officer; no doubt a stern\n          martinet who'll quote the rule book\n          at me and never... ever... allow me\n          to go on away missions.\n               (laughter)\n          ... Then there's the matter of my\n          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some\n          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll\n          be probing into my darkest psyche\n          as she nods her head and coos\n          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,\n          Deanna?\n\nDeanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,\nwonderful LAUGHTER!\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along\n          with the rest of you.

Again, I'm forced to ask,\n          Beverly, have you considered what\n          you're doing to little ole' me?!\n          I'll probably get some old battle-\n          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to\n          eat my vegetables and put me on\n          report if I don't show up for my\n          physical on time!\n\n<b>                     BEVERLY\n</b>          It'll serve you right.\n\nLaughter, laughter, laughter!

Deanna\n          Troi, you have been my conscience\n          and best guide, the touchstone to\n          the better parts of myself.  You\n          are my family.  And in proper\n          maritime tradition I wish you full\n          sails and a clear horizon... My\n          friends, make it so.\n\nThey drink.\n\n<b>EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER\n</b>\nThe party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a\nbeautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.\nThe soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen\neverywhere around us.\n\nDR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.\n\n<b>                     BEVERLY\n</b>               (playfully)\n          Sort of like losing a son and\n          gaining an empath, isn't it?\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          Please, Beverly, this is hard\n          enough.\n\n<b>                     BEVERLY\n</b>          If you start tearing up I promise\n          to beam you out.

There's no crying in\n          Starfleet.\n\nThey head off toward Riker and Deanna.\n\nMeanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.\n\n<b>                     LEAH\n</b>          I've never seen your Captain so\n          nostalgic.

After we installed the\n          new Series Four replicators, he\n          tried to order his usual tea and\n          there was a glitch.  Had us remove\n          the whole bunch of them and put the\n          old ones back in.\n\n<b>                     LEAH\n</b>          There!  Nostalgic about old\n          replicators.\n\n<b>                     GEORDI\n</b>          He just likes things the way he\n          likes them...\n               (he looks at her, smiles)\n          Of course, so do I.\n\nHe kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is\nstill suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down\nbeside them, belches.\n\n<b>                     WORF\n</b>          Romulan ale should be illegal.\n\n<b>                     GEORDI\n</b>          It is, old chum.\n\n<b>                     WORF\n</b>          Then it should be more illegal.\n\nHe groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's\ngoing to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to\nPicard and Beverly.\n\n<b>                     DEANNA\n</b>          Really, Captain, it was a lovely\n          toast.\n\n<b>                     PICARD\n</b>          The least I could do for you,\n          Deanna.

In my\n          study of Terran and Betazoid\n          conjugal rites I have discovered it\n          is traditional to present the\n          \"happy couple\" with a gift.  Given\n          Commander Riker's affection for\n          archaic musical forms I have\n          elected to present the following as\n          my gift in honor of their\n          conjugation.\n\nRiker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.
