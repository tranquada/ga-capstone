As it sputters off into the\n          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT\n<b>          SHOULDER.\n</b><b>          \n</b>          We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's\n          bumper.\n<b>                                   RADIO DJ\n</b>                    What a song. Thought we'd play\n                    that one in honor of Soft\n                    Shoulder. They're playing in\n                    Madison tonight. Should be a night\n                    to remember...\n          The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the\n          horizon.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                                   THE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Jennifer's-Body.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Jennifer's Body</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Diablo Cody\" title=\"Scripts by Diablo Cody\">Diablo Cody</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Jennifer's Body Script.html#comments\" title=\"Jennifer's Body comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:48.494642"}
