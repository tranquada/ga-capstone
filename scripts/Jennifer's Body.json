She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted\n          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds\n          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a\n          \"god's eye.\"\n          \n          Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot\n          SECURITY FENCE.\n          \n          Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered\n          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even\n          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring \"fans.\"\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O.\n                    Every day, I get letters.

A\n          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,\n          clipping her partner in the leg.

We see her name: ANITA \"NEEDY\" LESNICKI and a\n          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE\n          NOTIONS.

She picks at her skin with yellowed,\n          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock\n          of hair.\n          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH\n          FLAGS and underwear.\n          \n          An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half-\n          watches, distracted.\n                                  NEEDY V.O.\n                    Jennifer didn't always look this\n                    rough. Actually, she was the\n                    prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle\n                    when she wasn't so...hungry.\n          \n          Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer\n          was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O.

It's dark and\n          silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   7.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV.\n          Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window,\n          white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face\n          disappears.\n          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched\n          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if\n          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,\n          sploish, sploish.\n          \n          Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She\n          turns out the light. A beat of silence.\n          Then, the sound of cracking near the window.\n                                  JENNIFER\n                    Huh?\n          Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and\n          brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's\n          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically\n          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.\n          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES\n          Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.\n                                  NEEDY\n                    You'll throw me a bone, huh?

Kshink!\n                                  JENNIFER\n                         (GAGGING)\n                    Do you buy all your murder weapons\n                    at Home Depot?

Jennifer\n          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.\n          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy\n          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,\n          straddling her and bearing down.\n          \n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   8.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her\n          breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she\n          grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split\n          second, sexual control...\n          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right\n          with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing \"X\" on her\n          torso.\n                                  NEEDY (CONT'D)\n                         (HYSTERICAL)\n                    CROSS OUT JENNIFER!\n          Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and\n          disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence.\n          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE\n          CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne\n          heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL,\n          collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.\n          \n          Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into\n          Jennifer's HEART.

A DRUNK COUPLE begins\n          two-stepping in front of the stage.\n          Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls\n          him aside.

Jennifer's eyes never\n          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's\n          arm. Even the locals look charmed.\n          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling\n          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she\n          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.\n          \n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                               26.\n          CONTINUED: (7)\n          \n          The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to\n          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone\n          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the\n          fire.\n          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas\n          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar\n          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons\n          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he\n          watches from the stage...is he smiling?\n          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,\n          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE\n          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the\n          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.\n          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.\n          \n                                  NEEDY\n                         (to Jennifer)\n                    I know where to go!\n          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the\n          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the\n          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER\n          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the\n          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,\n          screaming.\n          \n          EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS\n          Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs\n          her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's\n          flushed face and looks into her eyes.\n          \n                                  JENNIFER\n                         (DAZED)\n                    It's so hot, Needy.

She swigs\n          it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.\n          \n          Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.\n                                  NEEDY\n                    Aren't you a little freaked out\n                    about this?

The song is, of course, \"Through\n          the Trees\" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,\n          hysterical.\n                                  NEEDY\n                    Fudge! Fudge!

Her eyes widen...\n          It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.\n          She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her\n          face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.\n          She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.\n          \n          Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of\n          control and slides into a ditch.\n          Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get\n          out of the trench.

The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins\n          at Needy through the cracking glass.\n          Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and\n          manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body\n          tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the\n          street.\n                                  RADIO DJ\n                    That was, of course, Soft\n                    Shoulder.

Then, a\n          procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest\n          of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,\n          flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon\n          hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.\n          These are Colin Gray's friends.\n          \n          One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on\n          the path as she stumbles along, weeping.\n          At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-\n          looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded\n          by sympathetic mourners.

GYM - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her.\n          People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage.\n          They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their\n          respective cliques.\n          She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are\n          playing an insufferably long coda.\n          \n          Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and\n          sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of\n          hate.\n          Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.\n          \n          Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at\n          Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha.

Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave\n          the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym\n          murmur and complain, confused.\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                              109.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the\n          stage and climbs up.

The police couldn't find\n                    an explanation for the \"substance\"\n                    in the pool, so they chose not to\n                    mention it to the press. In fact,\n                    they treated the whole incident\n                    like a bad dream.\n          \n          \n          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MORNING\n          We see the POLICE (including newly minted officer ROMAN\n          DUDA) informing Chip's mother that his body has been\n          found. She collapses onto the floor, curling up into the\n          fetal position.\n                                   NEEDY\n                    Trouble was, some of us would\n                    never wake up.\n          \n          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n          Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast.

My\n                    mom bought some books so she could\n                    teach me at home like crazy\n                    Christians with 14 kids do. But I\n                    wasn't a very cooperative student.\n          \n          Needy pulls the covers over her head.\n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                              110.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Toni shrugs, resigned, and tosses the book on the floor.\n          \n          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n          Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in\n          the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and\n          a hungry expression.\n          Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity\n          and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her\n          yard.\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O.\n                    What nobody realized was that I\n                    was doing a different kind of\n                    homework. I was watching her every\n                    night. Waiting.\n          We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her\n          hair with a appraising eye.\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O.

(CONT'D)\n                    It took weeks, but I finally made\n                    my move. Remember?\n          \n          \n          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n          \n          We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered\n          Jennifer.\n          Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.\n          The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of\n          the police.\n                                  NEEDY V.O.\n                    Even in her last moments of life,\n                    she somehow managed to be cooler\n                    than me.\n          \n          We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile\n          as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That\n          signature look of mastery and control.\n          \n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                              111.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n                                  NEEDY\n                    She left an insanely hot corpse.\n          \n          We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,\n          though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,\n          Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually\n          draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be\n          SMIRKING at us.\n          \n          INT. \"THE HOLE\" - NIGHT\n          We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been\n          narrating the whole sordid tale. She hasn't moved a\n          muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of\n          moonlight illuminates the room.\n          \n          An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door. It's\n          a pile of mystery meat. Needy wrinkes her nose.\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O.\n                    I don't even know who Needy\n                    Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a\n                    different person now. A person who\n                    uses curse words and kicks\n                    orderlies and and sees things that\n                    aren't there. A very bad, very\n                    damaged person.\n          \n          Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline\n          of her shirt...\n          \n                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)\n                    But sometimes, change can be good.\n                    For instance, most occult scholars\n                    don't know this, but if you're\n                    bitten by a demon--and you live--\n                    you just might absorb some of the\n                    demon's abilities.\n          In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected-\n          looking BITEMARK near her shoulder. She scratches it,\n          wincing.\n                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)\n                    You just might get lucky for once\n                    in your miserable life.\n          \n          PULL BACK to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is\n          HOVERING five feet off the floor. Effortlessly.\n          With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a\n          narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling. To anyone\n          with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access.\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                               112.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then\n          SMASHES it with surprising strength.\n          \n          EXT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER\n          Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.\n          She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and\n          passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only\n          a Needy-shaped hole remains.\n          \n          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER\n          Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.\n          The hospital recedes in the background.\n          A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching\n          Needy as she walks past.\n          \n          A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.\n          \"Through the Trees\" blasts from the radio.\n          Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.\n          \n                                  NEEDY\n                         (SINGING)\n                    \"Through the trees, I will find\n                    you.

MURPHY POOL - NIGHT\n          \n          Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,\n          crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces\n          are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been\n          arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture\n          of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.\n          Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing\n          along, their voices soaring.\n                                  VIGIL ATTENDEES\n                         (SINGING)\n                    \"...And the stars will remind you,\n                    we'll meet again...\"\n          \n          EXT.

Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the\n          creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE\n          KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be\n          seen again.\n          Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.\n          A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks\n          her thumb out again.\n          The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,\n          a grizzled older man, rolls down the window.
