DARK FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an\r\n          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          I am a common woman. I was born\r\n          in a common cottage in a common\r\n          village. My life would likely be\r\n          no different from yours, were it\r\n          not for the most uncommon events\r\n          that occurred during the winter of\r\n          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen\r\n          Hundred and Twenty-five. I\r\n          learned many things that winter.\r\n          About people. About love. But\r\n          mainly, I learned about loss.\r\n          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns\r\n          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          To this day, I am the only person\r\n          that I know to be living who knows\r\n          the whole truth about that\r\n          horrible time. This is my tale.\r\n          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,\r\n          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in\r\n          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.\r\n          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a\r\n          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.\r\n          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might\r\n          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a\r\n          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.\r\n          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly\r\n          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the\r\n          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n                         TEENAGE BOY\r\n          Did you hear that?\r\n\r\n                         FAT KNIGHT\r\n          Hear what?\r\n          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.\r\n\r\n                         TEENAGE BOY\r\n          The innkeeper told me --\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         FAT KNIGHT\r\n          I know what he told you. He told\r\n          you about the Wolf. The Beast of\r\n          Villiers la Crois\u00c3\u00a9e.\r\n          (off Boy's look)\r\n          The people of that village have\r\n          been spreading that nonsense since\r\n          before you were a tickle in your\r\n          daddy's prick. I'd give you a\r\n          whipping for believing it if I\r\n          thought it would do any good.\r\n          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.\r\n\r\n                         OLD KNIGHT\r\n          I used to travel these woods.\r\n          They told the same stories then\r\n          that they do now. Only I heard\r\n          them from a man who actually saw\r\n          the beast with his own eyes.\r\n\r\n                         FAT KNIGHT\r\n          Half the people in these parts\r\n          claim to have seen it.\r\n\r\n                         OLD KNIGHT\r\n          This man claimed it was the last\r\n          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took\r\n          his eyes. And half his face.\r\n          (off their looks)\r\n          I saw his scars and empty eye\r\n          sockets. His skin looked like it\r\n          was on inside-out. It didn't seem\r\n          to me like the kind of thing a man\r\n          would make up a story about.\r\n          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart\r\n          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.\r\n          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened\r\n          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there\r\n          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He\r\n          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.\r\n          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but\r\n          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a\r\n          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.\r\n          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.\r\n          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The\r\n          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's\r\n          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it\r\n          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.\r\n          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.\r\n          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles\r\n          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.\r\n\r\n                         FAT KNIGHT\r\n          What the devil are you --?!\r\n\r\n                         TEENAGE BOY\r\n          Wait, wait! Be quiet!\r\n          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.\r\n          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand\r\n          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and\r\n          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.\r\n          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward\r\n          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It\r\n          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching\r\n          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --\r\n          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above\r\n          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden\r\n          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.\r\n          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,\r\n          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...\r\n          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed\r\n          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.\r\n          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.\r\n          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips\r\n          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old\r\n          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy\r\n          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.\r\n\r\n                         TEENAGE BOY\r\n          Wait! We have to help him!\r\n          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We\r\n          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made\r\n          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...\r\n          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,\r\n          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the\r\n          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the\r\n          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.\r\n          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he\r\n          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\r\n          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking\r\n          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.\r\n          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,\r\n          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING\r\n          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.\r\n          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING\r\n          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way\r\n          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving\r\n          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --\r\n          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.\r\n          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't\r\n          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands\r\n          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters\r\n          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...\r\n          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.\r\n          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,\r\n          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.\r\n          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly\r\n          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him\r\n          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.\r\n          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.\r\n          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.\r\n          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at\r\n          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat\r\n          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --\r\n          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by\r\n          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up\r\n          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the\r\n          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --\r\n          -- he is yanked up out of sight.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig\r\n          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It\r\n          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.\r\n          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells\r\n          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked\r\n          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.\r\n          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But\r\n          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.\r\n          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:\r\n\r\n                         FRANCE\r\n\r\n                         1324\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is\r\n          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-\r\n          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY\r\n\r\n          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a\r\n          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is\r\n          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl\r\n          around on her hand, fascinated.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,\r\n          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-\r\n          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle\r\n          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.\r\n\r\n                         LUCIE\r\n          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I can't. It's the fifth\r\n          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.\r\n          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the\r\n          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,\r\n          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I'm going to take Father some\r\n          water.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          All right. Don't be long.\r\n          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously\r\n          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even\r\n          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark\r\n          contrast to her squalid surroundings.\r\n          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices\r\n          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted\r\n          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.\r\n\r\n                         CARPENTER\r\n          Hey, there! Let one of these\r\n          young lads get that for you.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I can do it myself.\r\n          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and\r\n          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the\r\n          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.\r\n          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One\r\n          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE\r\n          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives\r\n          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Mother thought you might be\r\n          thirsty.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          That was very thoughtful of her.\r\n          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the\r\n          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another\r\n          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER\r\n          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).\r\n          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then\r\n          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I'm taking a break.\r\n\r\n                         WOODCUTTER BOSS\r\n          A break? Does that mean you're\r\n          going to start working?\r\n          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.\r\n          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire\r\n          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...\r\n\r\n          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,\r\n          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes\r\n          her in his arms, kissing her.

Your\r\n          marriage to Henri will settle our\r\n          debt to his father.\r\n          Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          We know that you and Peter have\r\n          become friends. But you have\r\n          adult responsibilities now.

Because they hadn't lived\r\n          here since Noah built the ark?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          You mind your tongue.\r\n          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.\r\n          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.\r\n\r\n                         LUCIE\r\n          Do you realize how this makes me\r\n          look? I'm older than her by more\r\n          than a year. If anyone should be\r\n          getting married in the spring,\r\n          it's me.\r\n          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the\r\n          cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled.

Now I have\r\n          both of them hating me.\r\n          In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but\r\n          Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          We knew Isabelle was going to be\r\n          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her\r\n          to simply do as she's told. She's\r\n          too much like her grandmother.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          That she is. What about Lucie?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          She's a good girl, but she's still\r\n          a child. Talk to her. You're her\r\n          father. She'll listen to you.\r\n          Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's\r\n          been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed.\r\n          Isabelle gives her a sad look.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing\r\n          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still\r\n          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Hello, Isabelle.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Hello, Henri.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

About me?\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I'm not sure. We've never really\r\n          talked that much.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I know. That's why I asked you to\r\n          walk with me. I wanted to talk.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          What for?\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Well... because we're going to be\r\n          husband and wife soon.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Not until the spring festival.\r\n          That's months away. A lot can\r\n          happen in a few months.\r\n          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          All right. What would you like to\r\n          talk about?\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I'm not really sure. I brought\r\n          you this.\r\n          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.\r\n          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees\r\n          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Well, I'm glad we had this\r\n          conversation.\r\n          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri\r\n          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes\r\n          averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's\r\n          purposefully ignoring her mother.

But there's\r\n          more to marriage than being in\r\n          love.

They had to find out\r\n          eventually. Don't turn this into\r\n          something that it's not. We had\r\n          our fun, but that's all it ever\r\n          was.\r\n          Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't believe you.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Go home, Isabelle.

The picture on the moon sign is of a\r\n          three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to\r\n          a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face.\r\n\r\n                         HERALD\r\n          Full moon!

They all start\r\n          toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something...\r\n          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving\r\n          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.\r\n          Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.\r\n          Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          This doesn't concern you,\r\n          Isabelle.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Yes, Father.\r\n          Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away.

I had no idea our\r\n          young people were so woefully\r\n          uneducated these days.\r\n          (off their looks)\r\n          Our village was not always like\r\n          this. When I was young, this was\r\n          a very special place. Traders and\r\n          merchants came here from lands I'd\r\n          never heard of selling things I\r\n          had never seen. King Philip the\r\n          Bold even visited here once. But\r\n          that, of course, was before the\r\n          Wolf came.\r\n          The girls listen attentively.\r\n\r\n                         GRANDMOTHER\r\n          Your parents fear the Wolf because\r\n          they remember when it did kill\r\n          people from the village. Break\r\n          down doors in the middle of the\r\n          night and snatch children right\r\n          out of their beds. Rumors began\r\n          to spread that we were cursed.\r\n          That was when our village began to\r\n          die. And that was why my husband\r\n          led a group of men into the woods\r\n          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it\r\n          killed him.\r\n          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.\r\n\r\n                         GRANDMOTHER\r\n          After that, people here didn't\r\n          have much stomach to go hunting\r\n          for it anymore. But something had\r\n          changed. The Wolf stopped killing\r\n          in the village. Even our\r\n          livestock were usually safe as\r\n          long as they were brought inside.\r\n          So we decided it was safer to\r\n          compromise. We gave the Wolf its\r\n          one night a month, the night of\r\n          the full moon, and it has left us\r\n          alone ever since.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          People still die.\r\n\r\n                         ROSEMARIA\r\n          Yes, but nobody we know.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          23.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\r\n\r\n                         GRANDMOTHER\r\n          Everyone knows what should be\r\n          done.

Lucie numbly\r\n          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle\r\n          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          You were right. About Peter.

FULL MOON in the sky.\r\n          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,\r\n          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on\r\n          its rusty hooks.

She carefully makes her way across, only\r\n          breathing when she is safely on the other side.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          25.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...\r\n          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places\r\n          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress\r\n          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.\r\n          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her\r\n          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.\r\n          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the\r\n          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view.

She pushes through it, then stop short.\r\n          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but\r\n          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are\r\n          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.\r\n          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.\r\n\r\n          INT.

We all loved\r\n          her.\r\n          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he\r\n          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,\r\n          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes\r\n          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I'm here for you, too.\r\n          But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...\r\n\r\n          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY\r\n\r\n          ATTEWATER, the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of\r\n          the Villagers.

PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle\r\n          cottage.

Henri sees him.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          You're not coming with us?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Are you joking? These fools are\r\n          as likely to kill each other as\r\n          they are anything else.\r\n          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.\r\n          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle\r\n          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.\r\n          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,\r\n          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When\r\n          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks\r\n          away. Henri gives Peter a gloating look. Peter scowls.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - DUSK\r\n\r\n          The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline,\r\n          one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village.\r\n          They each have lit torches. CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched\r\n          in the brush. Cesaire walks along the line of men.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          Get that torch out.\r\n          Henri douses his torch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          35.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The full moon is high in the night sky. Snow is falling.\r\n          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.\r\n          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.\r\n          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,\r\n          staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods...\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake. Suddenly... a\r\n          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,\r\n          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the\r\n          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The\r\n          Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover...\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The HOWLING is getting closer. Isabelle goes to the\r\n          window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out... and is\r\n          startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it\r\n          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are\r\n          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him\r\n          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --\r\n          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          Who was that screaming?\r\n\r\n                         CARPENTER\r\n          I don't know.\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          Look.\r\n          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a\r\n          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.\r\n          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time\r\n          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary\r\n          look, but then start after it.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          36.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered\r\n          brush is as high as their waists. They pause and listen.\r\n          Only silence. They carefully make their way in the\r\n          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves\r\n          CRUNCH under their feet...\r\n          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they\r\n          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts\r\n          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.\r\n          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,\r\n          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.\r\n          He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          Which way did it go?\r\n          The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve\r\n          plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky\r\n          hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS\r\n          again. The Men look up at the hillside.\r\n\r\n                         CARPENTER\r\n          The caves. It's in the caves.\r\n\r\n          INT. CAVE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting\r\n          their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The\r\n          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark\r\n          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...\r\n          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they\r\n          approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The\r\n          SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell\r\n          where it's coming from.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          Split up. Two groups.\r\n          Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow\r\n          the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men\r\n          crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be\r\n          getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening.\r\n          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The\r\n          SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch\r\n          inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          37.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the\r\n          wall to keep from falling...\r\n          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles\r\n          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep\r\n          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop\r\n          himself, and then --\r\n          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the\r\n          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope\r\n          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The\r\n          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore\r\n          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.\r\n          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.\r\n          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning\r\n          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood\r\n          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.\r\n          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees\r\n          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...\r\n          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's\r\n          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.\r\n          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his\r\n          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling\r\n          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood\r\n          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --\r\n          -- just as the wolf attacks.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN\r\n\r\n          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing\r\n          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.\r\n          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and\r\n          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting\r\n          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or\r\n          failure. But as they near...\r\n          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike\r\n          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,\r\n          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle\r\n          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.\r\n          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are\r\n          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back\r\n          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and\r\n          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle\r\n          enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I heard your father wounded the\r\n          beast. He was a brave man.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Did you hear what it did to him?\r\n          It chewed off his private parts.\r\n          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          And I did nothing. I was too\r\n          scared. I couldn't move. I just\r\n          let my father be eaten alive.\r\n          She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          No. I don't want you here.\r\n          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just\r\n          keeps hammering away on the anvil.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHURCH - DAY\r\n\r\n          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses\r\n          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with\r\n          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:\r\n\r\n                         LUCRECE\r\n          I thought your mother would be\r\n          here. They used to be quite\r\n          close.\r\n          Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing\r\n          more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden\r\n          realization...\r\n\r\n          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as\r\n          she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes\r\n          her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          You told me you had a sweetheart\r\n          before you were married. It was\r\n          Henri's father, wasn't it?\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Lucie was in love with Henri. She\r\n          could have married him.\r\n          (off Suzette's look)\r\n          Couldn't she have?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          We arranged for you to marry him.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          But you gained the same no matter\r\n          which one of us married him. So\r\n          why did it have to be me?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          I think you know the answer to\r\n          that question.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          No. You say it.\r\n          Suzette's eyes well up. Then:\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          Lucie was Henri's half-sister.\r\n          She was not your father's\r\n          daughter.\r\n          Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Am I? Do you even know?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          Yes. I was already pregnant when\r\n          your father and I married.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Does he know?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          No. And he must never know.\r\n          Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          Isabelle!\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Promise me you won't tell him.\r\n          Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She\r\n          leaves without answering.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to\r\n          Isabelle. Isabelle's eyes are red from crying.\r\n\r\n                         GRANDMOTHER\r\n          I've found that there's no burden\r\n          that doesn't at least seem a\r\n          little lighter on a full stomach.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't know what to do. She\r\n          wants me to pretend like I don't\r\n          know. How am I supposed to go on\r\n          living in that house?\r\n\r\n                         GRANDMOTHER\r\n          You have a right to be angry with\r\n          her. But try not to hate her.\r\n          Too much hate will eat you alive.\r\n          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's\r\n          shoulder.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and\r\n          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except\r\n          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...\r\n\r\n          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people\r\n          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of\r\n          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:\r\n          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him\r\n          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.\r\n          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.\r\n          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his\r\n          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          You're a good girl.\r\n          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his\r\n          chest, and leaves.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children\r\n          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and\r\n          Prudence.\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          I heard there's going to be a\r\n          festival on the night of the next\r\n          full moon. To celebrate.\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          A festival? I've never been to\r\n          one!\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          My father says he hasn't seen one\r\n          since he was a boy.\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          It's strange, isn't it? You think\r\n          because things have been a certain\r\n          way your whole life that they'll\r\n          always be the same. Then\r\n          overnight everything just changes.\r\n          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,\r\n          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.\r\n          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.\r\n          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly\r\n          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...\r\n          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets\r\n          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored\r\n          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.\r\n          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red\r\n          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.\r\n          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle\r\n          gives it an uneasy look.\r\n          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his\r\n          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the\r\n          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          This is Villiers la Crois\u00c3\u00a9e?\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          Yes, my lord.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          Summon your bailiff. My master\r\n          would speak with him at once.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          Of course, my lord. May I ask to\r\n          what does he owe this honor?\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          He requested the services of His\r\n          Eminence, the Witchfinder General.\r\n          You may tell him that he has\r\n          arrived.\r\n          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a\r\n          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)\r\n\r\n          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and\r\n          another opens the door. The whole village has turned\r\n          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,\r\n          standing front and center, seems uneasy.\r\n          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with\r\n          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange\r\n          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly\r\n          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt\r\n          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,\r\n          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          This is indeed an honor, Your\r\n          Eminence.\r\n          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed\r\n          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          As you can see, our werewolf\r\n          problem has been dealt with.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          That is no werewolf.\r\n          Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle\r\n          and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          When a werewolf dies, it returns\r\n          to its human form. If what you\r\n          killed was a werewolf, then you\r\n          would have a human head skewered\r\n          atop that pole.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          And I suppose you've seen this? A\r\n          wolf turning into a man?\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks\r\n          toward him. The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without\r\n          doubt, the bigger man. The Reeve's eyes flick nervously\r\n          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          My wife's name was P\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9lope. She\r\n          was very pretty. And we were very\r\n          happy.\r\n          The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.\r\n          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          We lived in a village not unlike\r\n          this place. And not unlike this\r\n          place, our village was plagued by\r\n          a werewolf. I went out with some\r\n          men to hunt it. It never even\r\n          occurred to me that we might\r\n          actually find it. But we did.\r\n          He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          It attacked me. All I saw were\r\n          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with\r\n          an axe and suddenly it was gone.\r\n          There was blood on my axe. I had\r\n          cut off one of its paws. I picked\r\n          it up and put it in my sack.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          When I returned home in the\r\n          morning, I found my wife with a\r\n          bloody rag tied around her left\r\n          wrist. And when I opened my sack,\r\n          the werewolf's paw was gone. This\r\n          is what I found in its place.\r\n          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches\r\n          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing\r\n          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Her name was P\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9lope. She was\r\n          very pretty. And we were very\r\n          happy. Until the day I killed\r\n          her.\r\n          Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Your werewolf is still alive. And\r\n          I promise you, it will kill again.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          44.\r\n\r\n          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit\r\n          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain\r\n          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the\r\n          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is\r\n          shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          I have examined the body of your\r\n          blacksmith. There were bruises on\r\n          his neck from where the beast held\r\n          him in its jaws, squeezing his\r\n          throat so that he could not\r\n          scream.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          But he did scream.

It\r\n          used him as bait to lure you into\r\n          the bit of theater it had\r\n          prepared.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Theater?

But\r\n          the animal that you killed was not\r\n          the werewolf.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          There was blood dripping from its\r\n          teeth.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          The blood was its own. The\r\n          werewolf most likely wounded it\r\n          earlier in the evening and left it\r\n          in the cave for you to find and\r\n          kill.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          '\u009cMost likely,'\u009d he says. Have you\r\n          ever heard anything more unlikely\r\n          in your lives?\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          45.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          Your Eminence, if what you say is\r\n          true, that we were somehow fooled\r\n          by this thing, it could not have\r\n          done so without foreknowledge of\r\n          our plan to hunt it.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          That's correct. The werewolf does\r\n          not live in the forest as you have\r\n          rather na\u00c3\u00afvely assumed. It lives\r\n          here in the village. Among you.\r\n          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting\r\n          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          You come here and tell us that\r\n          this boy's father died for\r\n          nothing. You accuse us and call\r\n          us fools. Well, I believe what I\r\n          can see with my own eyes. That\r\n          wolf is dead. And I know it's\r\n          dead because I was with the brave\r\n          men who killed it.\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          And what of the festival?\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          The festival was to celebrate the\r\n          death of the Wolf.\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          And we say that it's dead! We've\r\n          spent every full moon for the past\r\n          forty years cowering in our homes.\r\n          We've earned a celebration.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          And paid for it in blood!\r\n          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Have your festival. I will stay\r\n          on here until then to ensure that\r\n          you have the celebration you all\r\n          so richly deserve.\r\n          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug\r\n          Merchant.

He leaves.\r\n          Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her.\r\n          Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries\r\n          off after Peter.

The Villagers gape in horror. It makes\r\n          the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But\r\n          there's something about its face that isn't canine at\r\n          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.\r\n          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,\r\n          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.\r\n          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the\r\n          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it\r\n          surrounded.

He tugs the reins and his horse rears back.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Get to the church, you fools!\r\n          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n\r\n          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S\r\n\r\n          HOLY LOVE!\r\n          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.\r\n          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to\r\n          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming\r\n          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.\r\n          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.\r\n          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for\r\n          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall\r\n          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.\r\n          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,\r\n          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the\r\n          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --\r\n          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs\r\n          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the\r\n          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches\r\n          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.\r\n          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more\r\n          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It\r\n          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it\r\n          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --\r\n          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at\r\n          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another\r\n          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it\r\n          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to\r\n          the ground with one enormous paw.\r\n          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags\r\n          her away from the ongoing battle.\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          Where's Claude?

It stands on top of the door, pinning the\r\n          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his\r\n          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The Wolf\r\n          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn\r\n          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...\r\n          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS\r\n          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads\r\n          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:\r\n\r\n          ROXANNE (O.S.)\r\n          Claude! Claude!!\r\n          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne\r\n          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          Claude!

He can't\r\n          hear you and you are going to get\r\n          us killed. Do you understand me?\r\n          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds\r\n          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.\r\n          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Come on!\r\n          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make\r\n          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...\r\n          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The\r\n          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward\r\n          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-\r\n          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Well, well. You look very pretty\r\n          this evening, my dear. Good\r\n          enough to eat.\r\n          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's\r\n          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          It's considered polite to thank\r\n          someone when they pay you a\r\n          compliment. Are you being\r\n          impolite, Isabelle?\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          How do you know me? Who are you?\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          Isabelle...?\r\n          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to\r\n          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its\r\n          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost\r\n          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          What big eyes you have...\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          The better to see you with, my\r\n          dear.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Are you going to kill us?\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Kill you?

We\r\n          are both wild things. You show\r\n          one face to the world, but there\r\n          is another face that you hide. A\r\n          fire burning inside you, waiting\r\n          to be released.\r\n          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its\r\n          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Yes. I can smell it on you even\r\n          now.\r\n          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its\r\n          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its\r\n          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Leave with me tonight. Run with\r\n          me. The only shackles binding you\r\n          are of your own making. Slip them\r\n          and I can show you the world and\r\n          every pleasure in it.\r\n          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't know who you are, but we\r\n          are not the same.

Or I will kill\r\n          her. And I will keep killing\r\n          until you agree to leave with me.\r\n          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,\r\n          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Choose now. Quickly.\r\n          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified\r\n          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Your silence has doomed them all.\r\n          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The\r\n          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          Come the next full moon, their\r\n          blood will be on your hands.\r\n          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after\r\n          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back\r\n          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And\r\n          then the Wolf is gone.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne\r\n          inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          We are safe here. God protects\r\n          his own house and those within it.\r\n          Isabelle finds Prudence.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Is Peter here?\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          Peter?

Please?\r\n          Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a\r\n          corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          You talked to it.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          It talked to us.\r\n          A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.\r\n\r\n                         ROXANNE\r\n          No. It only growled.\r\n          (off Isabelle's look)\r\n          You heard it talk to you?\r\n          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to\r\n          see if anyone has overheard. Then:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Do not speak of this to anyone.\r\n          Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns\r\n          away, afraid and confused.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN\r\n\r\n          Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers\r\n          out.

ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN\r\n\r\n          Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A\r\n          chair has been overturned.

Solomon kneels at his side.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Are you bitten?\r\n          Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his\r\n          eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Step back.\r\n          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before\r\n          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it\r\n          into the Soldier's heart.

Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.\r\n          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,\r\n          the Villagers kneel to Solomon.

PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens\r\n          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as\r\n          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives\r\n          him a concerned look.

In order for a\r\n          woman to be turned, she must\r\n          inherit the curse. But even then\r\n          it will lie dormant unless she\r\n          eats human flesh. Only then will\r\n          the bite of a male werewolf change\r\n          her. Only then can she become a\r\n          werewolf and capable of passing\r\n          the curse on to her own children.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          But it could be a woman.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Of course.

Listen more carefully\r\n          this time.\r\n          He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the\r\n          fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All\r\n          he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull.\r\n          The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Listen to how he sings of his love\r\n          of Satan. How he despairs that he\r\n          will never again copulate with the\r\n          dead or sink his teeth into the\r\n          flesh of pregnant women and eat\r\n          their unborn children.\r\n          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly\r\n          realizing. Father Solomon is insane.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          Stop this.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          No. You stop it.\r\n          (off his look)\r\n          We both know he is guilty.

Sign\r\n          this and we have a confession.\r\n          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the\r\n          document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the\r\n          bull and pull Claude out.

His\r\n          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          This is the business of werewolf\r\n          hunting and you had best develop a\r\n          stomach for it.

He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body\r\n          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle\r\n          chokes back her disgust and goes to him.

She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with\r\n          her cane, her back to the veil...\r\n          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a\r\n          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...\r\n          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the\r\n          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting\r\n          anything.

It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and\r\n          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.\r\n          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.\r\n          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but\r\n          can do nothing. The knife flashes.\r\n          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure\r\n          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of\r\n          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.\r\n          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the\r\n          letter Grandmother was writing.

He hurries to the window and peers out...\r\n          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but\r\n          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of\r\n          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.\r\n          Their feet are visible under the crack.\r\n          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.\r\n          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is\r\n          expanding toward the door...\r\n          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his\r\n          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,\r\n          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          Go away.\r\n          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          Are you all right?\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          I'm sick.

The Figure\r\n          secretly watches from the window.\r\n          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to\r\n          run under the door.

If she figured out who\r\n          it is, I need to know now.\r\n          Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,\r\n          flanked by Soldiers. They drag Cesaire to his feet.\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n          Wait! What has he done?\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          It's just a precaution. Father\r\n          Solomon doesn't want the girl's\r\n          family interfering.\r\n          Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits\r\n          the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.\r\n          Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground.\r\n          The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out.\r\n          The Soldiers drag him away. Attewater watches them go...\r\n\r\n          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY\r\n\r\n          Soldiers haul Cesaire's unconscious body downstairs.\r\n          Isabelle watches as they throw him in another cell.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          What have you done to him?!\r\n          Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding\r\n          iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The\r\n          Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...\r\n\r\n          CESAIRE (O.S.)\r\n          Isabelle...\r\n          He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,\r\n          runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I love you so much.

You don't\r\n          know how much.\r\n          The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the\r\n          stairs. Cesaire shakes his cell door with impotent rage.\r\n\r\n                         CESAIRE\r\n          Bastards!\r\n\r\n          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach. The\r\n          Captain approaches with a '\u009chumiliation mask'\u009d: an iron\r\n          mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny\r\n          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a\r\n          wolf's head. Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it...\r\n          ... then the Captain puts it over her head. Inside the\r\n          mask: almost total darkness. The Captain locks it on.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush.\r\n          Isabelle trudges along behind it. The Villagers line the\r\n          road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the\r\n          streets in her horrific iron wolf mask. Lucrece sneers.\r\n\r\n                         LUCRECE\r\n          Not so pretty now, is she?\r\n          The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently\r\n          fuming. Prudence stands next to him. She looks around.\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          Where's Peter?\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I haven't seen him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the\r\n          stocks. As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches,\r\n          Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          We, Bailiff Attewater, Father\r\n          Auguste, and Father Solomon of\r\n          Avignon, having in mind that you,\r\n          Isabelle Ordeville of Villiers la\r\n          Crois\u00c3\u00a9e in the Diocese of Saint-\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)\r\n          Flour, by your own confession,\r\n          have committed acts of vulgar\r\n          heresy, convict you of the sins of\r\n          witches and condemn you to the\r\n          mercy of werewolf. This is the\r\n          sentence given.\r\n          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.\r\n          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father\r\n          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Help...\r\n          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably\r\n          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Help me... Please... Help me...\r\n          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees\r\n          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n\r\n          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T\r\n\r\n          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!\r\n          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling\r\n          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.\r\n\r\n          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies\r\n          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,\r\n          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,\r\n          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          Isabelle?

And now you're\r\n          going to get what you deserve.\r\n          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I think you'd better go now.\r\n          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.\r\n\r\n                         PRUDENCE\r\n          Yes. It won't be long now.\r\n\r\n          ACROSS THE SQUARE\r\n          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He\r\n          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          No one shoots until I give the\r\n          order.\r\n          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with\r\n          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws\r\n          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The streets are empty.

VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around\r\n          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with\r\n          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.\r\n          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The\r\n          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.\r\n          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her\r\n          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          There.\r\n          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE\r\n          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Hold your fire...\r\n          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists\r\n          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --\r\n          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see\r\n          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.\r\n          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:\r\n\r\n          HENRI (O.S.)\r\n          Hey! Stop it! It's me!\r\n          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and\r\n          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Get away from me!\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is\r\n          out!

It couldn't be him.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I'm trying to get you out of this.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Yes! Yes, please hurry!\r\n          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and\r\n          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          He's going to free her.\r\n          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Patience. It's close now...\r\n          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!\r\n          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open\r\n          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Can you stand?\r\n          Isabelle nods. In the loft:\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Kill him.\r\n          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain\r\n          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...\r\n          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.\r\n          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:\r\n\r\n                         ATTEWATER\r\n\r\n          RUN!\r\n          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a\r\n          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet\r\n          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.\r\n          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few\r\n          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          The witch has escaped!

STABLE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a\r\n          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the\r\n          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.\r\n          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,\r\n          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to\r\n          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but\r\n          then it veers off into the village and disappears.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          It's gone.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't think so...\r\n          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of\r\n          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but\r\n          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.\r\n          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,\r\n          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and\r\n          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps\r\n          onto its roof, then leaps off again --\r\n          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri\r\n          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,\r\n          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,\r\n          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.\r\n          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his\r\n          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself\r\n          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's\r\n          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --\r\n          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The\r\n          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares\r\n          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.\r\n          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is\r\n          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at\r\n          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle\r\n          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          Take her! Take her and leave us\r\n          in peace!\r\n          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          95.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          You can't outrun me, my dear.

Let me show you what you\r\n          are.\r\n          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes\r\n          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and\r\n          raises it to hit the Wolf.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Get away from her!\r\n          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,\r\n          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a\r\n          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The\r\n          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.\r\n          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the\r\n          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.\r\n          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and\r\n          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,\r\n          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.\r\n          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into\r\n          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the\r\n          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam\r\n          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,\r\n          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.\r\n          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand\r\n          their ground and the Wolf attacks.\r\n          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are\r\n          more Soldiers up ahead.

ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed\r\n          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and\r\n          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of\r\n          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns\r\n          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.\r\n          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly\r\n          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races\r\n          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two\r\n          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,\r\n          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.\r\n          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.\r\n          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the\r\n          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head\r\n          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,\r\n          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --\r\n          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the\r\n          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the\r\n          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from\r\n          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:\r\n\r\n          CAPTAIN (O.S.)\r\n          There!\r\n          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier\r\n          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...\r\n          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it\r\n          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,\r\n          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.\r\n          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.\r\n          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle\r\n          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --\r\n          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She\r\n          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.\r\n          Then she jumps down to the other side.\r\n          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is\r\n          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks\r\n          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has\r\n          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the\r\n          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a\r\n          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a\r\n          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          99.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she\r\n          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...\r\n          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding\r\n          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they\r\n          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --\r\n          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.\r\n          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the\r\n          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her\r\n          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          At least you won't die alone now.\r\n          Your friends will all hang with\r\n          you.\r\n          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father\r\n          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the\r\n          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon\r\n          picks up his sword and stands to face it.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          If you come for her, you come\r\n          through me.\r\n          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises\r\n          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the\r\n          square, followed by a group of Villagers.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          Stay back!\r\n          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,\r\n          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.\r\n          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on\r\n          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.\r\n          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf\r\n          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...\r\n          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon\r\n          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf\r\n          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --\r\n          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the\r\n          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries\r\n          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          There is your mighty werewolf\r\n          hunter.

The Wolf slowly steps toward her,\r\n          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The\r\n          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.\r\n          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          You bastard! You killed my\r\n          father!\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Henri, what are you doing?\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          I'm not letting it take you.\r\n          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in\r\n          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it\r\n          if we stand together!\r\n          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Father Solomon was one man. His\r\n          soldiers were mercenaries. But we\r\n          are a village!\r\n          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          He's right. It's a coward at\r\n          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't\r\n          it attack?\r\n          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but\r\n          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.\r\n\r\n                         MERCHANT\r\n          You killed my daughter!\r\n          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.\r\n          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.\r\n          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a\r\n          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.\r\n          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but\r\n          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and\r\n          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,\r\n          but there are too many of them.\r\n          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in\r\n          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't\r\n          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\r\n          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed\r\n          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers\r\n          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping\r\n          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOLF\r\n          I will come for you again.\r\n          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The\r\n          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest\r\n          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI\r\n          Are you all right?\r\n          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...\r\n\r\n          SOLOMON (O.S.)\r\n          This isn't over.\r\n          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.\r\n\r\n                         SOLOMON\r\n          I am bitten.\r\n          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri\r\n          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses\r\n          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns\r\n          away. Isabelle doesn't.\r\n          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as\r\n          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword\r\n          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's\r\n          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.\r\n          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          It's past noon.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          I know. I didn't want to wake\r\n          you.\r\n          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face\r\n          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Where's Father?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          He'll be home soon. They have no\r\n          reason to hold him any longer.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Did they catch the Wolf?\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          No. They lost it in the forest.\r\n          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          What about Grandmother?\r\n          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.\r\n\r\n                         SUZETTE\r\n          Roxanne came by. She said your\r\n          grandmother has fallen ill. I was\r\n          hoping you could look in on her.\r\n          Off Isabelle's troubled look...\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red\r\n          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower\r\n          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping\r\n          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.\r\n          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.\r\n          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops\r\n          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the\r\n          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.\r\n          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She\r\n          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Thank God you're all right.\r\n          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help\r\n          me.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          103.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          What did he tell you?\r\n          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Those people back there. I know\r\n          they mean well, but they're just\r\n          people. I didn't expect anything\r\n          from them. I expected something\r\n          from you.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I just need to talk to you.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I'm going to see my Grandmother.\r\n          She's sick. Please don't follow\r\n          me.\r\n          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,\r\n          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She\r\n          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...\r\n          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks\r\n          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then\r\n          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows\r\n          her in the fog. She walks faster.\r\n          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The\r\n          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.\r\n          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the\r\n          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks\r\n          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main\r\n          path, she throws the branch aside...\r\n          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks\r\n          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GULLY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten\r\n          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks\r\n          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges\r\n          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,\r\n          holding onto the rope with both hands...\r\n          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At\r\n          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken\r\n          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to\r\n          catch her breath before continuing...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the\r\n          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She\r\n          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Grandmother? Are you awake?\r\n          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:\r\n\r\n          THE FIGURE (O.S.)\r\n          Pull the bobbin. The latch will\r\n          open.\r\n          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,\r\n          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...\r\n\r\n          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK\r\n\r\n          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.\r\n\r\n                         REEVE\r\n          You're certain nobody has seen him\r\n          since last night?\r\n\r\n                         GUARD\r\n          The Wolf must have taken him.\r\n          What else could have done that?\r\n          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.\r\n          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...\r\n\r\n          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the\r\n          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It\r\n          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.\r\n          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond\r\n          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is\r\n          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.\r\n          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          I've been expecting you.\r\n          Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Mother sent some food. There are\r\n          cakes and a pot of butter --\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          Don't come in here.\r\n          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in\r\n          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          I'm not hungry right now.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Are you sure? You sound so weak.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          I just made myself a stew. I left\r\n          it over the fire for you.\r\n          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I came here to take care of you.\r\n          Not the other way around.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          Don't be silly, my dear. You've\r\n          been through so much. Sit down.\r\n          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on\r\n          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's\r\n          knitting needles sticking out of it.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          There's no burden so heavy that it\r\n          doesn't seem a little lighter on a\r\n          full stomach.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n\r\n                         (SMILES)\r\n          You always say that.\r\n          She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat\r\n          looks up from its grooming, watching her...\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          That's right. Eat up, my dear.\r\n          Eat up.\r\n          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up\r\n          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I've been worried about you.

He saved my life.\r\n          Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She\r\n          puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I feel hot all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          It's just the stew warming you.\r\n          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a\r\n          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.\r\n          That's what it has been licking this whole time.\r\n          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a\r\n          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks\r\n          of white meat...\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          What is this...?\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          If you don't like it, there's wine\r\n          on the table to wash it down.\r\n          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and\r\n          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.\r\n          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,\r\n          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.\r\n          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours\r\n          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the\r\n          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          Oh, what pretty red lips. Come\r\n          and give your Granny a kiss, my\r\n          dear.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't think I want to.\r\n\r\n                         THE FIGURE\r\n          Then I will come to you.\r\n          And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She\r\n          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller\r\n          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the\r\n          Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles\r\n          into the firelight, revealing its face...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED: (3)\r\n          It's Cesaire.

A long beat.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          People should know what he was.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          We can't tell anyone. If they\r\n          don't believe you, they'll hang\r\n          you for this. And if they do\r\n          believe you, they'll hang you for\r\n          being the daughter of the Wolf.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Then I'll run away. I was ready\r\n          to run away last night.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Why didn't you come for me?\r\n          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he\r\n          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a\r\n          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I was bitten at the festival. I\r\n          spent last night in the woods\r\n          because I was afraid of what might\r\n          happen...\r\n\r\n                         (A BEAT)\r\n          I changed. I'm like him now.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          No, you're not. You could never\r\n          be like him.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          116.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's\r\n          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I can't stay here.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Yes, you can. We can still be\r\n          together. My father lived here.\r\n          My grandfather lived here.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Your father and your grandfather\r\n          killed people. They couldn't help\r\n          themselves. If I stay here, I\r\n          won't be able to control myself.\r\n          (off her look)\r\n          I have to be alone.\r\n          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like\r\n          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...\r\n\r\n          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The\r\n          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          We could take him to the river.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I don't want him ever found.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          We'll weight him with rocks.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          No. We'll put the rocks inside\r\n          him.\r\n          (off his look)\r\n          Cut him open. I will sew the\r\n          rocks inside him.\r\n          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.\r\n\r\n          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next\r\n          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes\r\n          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter\r\n          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder\r\n          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          117.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly\r\n          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's\r\n          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.\r\n          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame\r\n          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs\r\n          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.\r\n          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a\r\n          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in\r\n          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove\r\n          off, but Isabelle stops him:\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Wait.\r\n          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.\r\n          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his\r\n          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting\r\n          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them\r\n          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.\r\n          Peter gives her a questioning look.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          These belonged to my grandmother.\r\n          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes\r\n          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he\r\n          does... something begins to shine through in the\r\n          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          They're silver.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.\r\n          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in\r\n          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...\r\n          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the\r\n          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Death was too good for him.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          I can live with it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          118.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and\r\n          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last\r\n          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Where will you go?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I don't know.

I don't want\r\n          you to wait for me. This is the\r\n          last time you'll ever see me.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          No, it isn't. You'll be in my\r\n          dreams until the day I die.\r\n          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You know, Henri is a good man.\r\n\r\n                         ISABELLE\r\n          Yes, he is.\r\n          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.\r\n          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          I never saw him again.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY\r\n\r\n          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with\r\n          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers\r\n          bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          Life in my village was changed\r\n          forever. There were many\r\n          questions and few answers.

CHURCH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're\r\n          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and\r\n          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          Henri and I were married. He was\r\n          a good man and a good father. I\r\n          loved him very much. But I never\r\n          loved him the same way that I\r\n          loved Peter. That was the one\r\n          secret in our marriage.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing\r\n          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.\r\n          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          I only tell you now because he is\r\n          dead. And if he knows now, I\r\n          believe that he forgives me, for\r\n          he must also know that I never\r\n          loved him falsely.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,\r\n          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed\r\n          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          This is my story, not that I\r\n          expect you will believe it. In my\r\n          own village, the events of that\r\n          awful winter have already passed\r\n          into legend. Parents tell their\r\n          children to be good or else the\r\n          Wolf will come and gobble them up.\r\n          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          They've already forgotten. A\r\n          simple children's story is all\r\n          that remains.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          120.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up\r\n          at the sky. The moon is full.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          But sometimes, when the moon is\r\n          full, my thoughts still turn to\r\n          Peter. He promised me that I\r\n          would never see him again. And I\r\n          never have.\r\n          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.\r\n\r\n          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)\r\n          But I often wonder if I hear him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF\r\n          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell\r\n          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...\r\n          Or something else.\r\n          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we\r\n\r\n          FADE OUT.\r\n\r\n                         THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nRed Riding Hood\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Leslie Johnson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:41.225870"}
