Dad was a Yankees\r\n          fan then, so of course I rooted for\r\n          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved\r\n          away, so we had to find other things to\r\n          fight about. We did. And when it came\r\n          time to go to college, I picked the\r\n          farthest one from home I could find.\r\n          Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.0.)\r\n          This, of course, drove him right up the\r\n          wail, which I suppose was the point.\r\n          Officially my major was English, but\r\n          really it was the Sixties.\r\n          Ray looking foolish in long hair and tie-dye.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.O.)\r\n          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried\r\n          to like sitar music... and I met Annie.\r\n          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.0.)\r\n          The only thing we had in common was that\r\n          she came from Iowa and I had once heard\r\n          of Iowa. We moved in together. After\r\n          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and\r\n          stayed with her family as long as we\r\n          could.\r\n          Unsmiling American Gothic types.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.O.)\r\n          Almost a full afternoon.\r\n          The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.0.)\r\n          We rented an apartment and I took a job\r\n          selling insurance. I also drove a cab\r\n          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died\r\n          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married\r\n          that fail.\r\n          Baby pictures.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.O.)\r\n          A few years later Karin was born. She\r\n          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.\r\n          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she\r\n          could talk me into buying a farm.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         3\r\n\r\n                         1 CONTINUED (2)\r\n\r\n                         1\r\n          Ray, Annie, and four-year-old Karin by the \"SOLD\" sign of\r\n          their farm.

I love my family,\r\n          I love baseball, and I miss New York.\r\n          Moving in on Ray's face.\r\n\r\n          RAY (V.0.)\r\n          But until I heard The Voice...I'd never\r\n          done a crazy thing in my whole life.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO\r\n\r\n          2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK\r\n\r\n                         2\r\n          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg\r\n          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray\r\n          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like\r\n          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.\r\n\r\n                         THE VOICE\r\n          'If you build it, he will come.'\r\n          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the\r\n          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.\r\n          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to\r\n          work.\r\n\r\n                         THE VOICE\r\n          'If you build it, he will come.'\r\n          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this\r\n          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual\r\n          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,\r\n          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three\r\n          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where\r\n          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n\r\n                         (CALLS)\r\n          Annie, what was that?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n\r\n                         (CALLS BACK)\r\n          What was what?\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          That voice.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          What voice?\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         4\r\n\r\n                         2 CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         2\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Just now.

Again, he sees\r\n          nothing. This is beginning to bug him.

But there is no one there. He\r\n          puts down his tools and walks toward the house.\r\n\r\n          5 INT.

For all I know, he may have even\r\n          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't\r\n          listen to them.

On his uniform is a large \"S\" with\r\n          an \"O\" in the top crook, an \"X\" in the bottom, and an\r\n          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.\r\n\r\n                         53 RAY\r\n\r\n                         53\r\n          walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field.\r\n\r\n          54 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\n                         54\r\n          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in\r\n          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the\r\n          waist, hands on hips, he waits.\r\n\r\n                         55 RAY\r\n\r\n                         55\r\n          Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one\r\n          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back\r\n          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.\r\n\r\n          56 IN THE OUTFIELD\r\n\r\n                         56\r\n          The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style\r\n          glove, and waits to field the ball.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         24\r\n\r\n          57 AT HOME PLATE 57\r\n          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at\r\n          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,\r\n          and tries again. This time he connects.\r\n\r\n                         58 THE FIELD 58\r\n          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a\r\n          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and\r\n          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it\r\n          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.\r\n          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this\r\n          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man\r\n          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          How's the field play?\r\n\r\n                         THE MAN\r\n          It's good. The ball bounces true.\r\n          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives\r\n          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually\r\n          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man\r\n          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in\r\n          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man\r\n          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Hi.\r\n          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel\r\n          its weight.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Ray Kinsella.\r\n\r\n                         THE MAN\r\n          Joe Jackson.\r\n          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless\r\n          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from\r\n          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if\r\n          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.\r\n          Finally, he can't help himself.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          I bet its good to be playing again,\r\n          huh?\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          It was like having part of me amputated.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         25\r\n\r\n                         58 CONTINUED\r\n          Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain\r\n          his steady voice tries to conceal.\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          I've heard that old man wake up and\r\n          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for\r\n          fifty years.

The thrill of the\r\n          grass...\r\n          He has found the bat he likes.\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          Can you pitch?\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n\r\n                         (WITH FALSE\r\n\r\n                         MODESTY)\r\n          Yeah, I'm not bad.\r\n          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain\r\n          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the\r\n          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Don't we need a catcher?\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          Not if you can get it near the plate,\r\n          we don't.\r\n          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during\r\n          which he says aloud to himself:\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.\r\n          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has\r\n          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is\r\n          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the\r\n          ball against the fence.\r\n          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson\r\n          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.\r\n          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          See if you can hit my curve.\r\n          \u00b0He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not\r\n          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         26\r\n\r\n                         58 CONTINUED (2) 58\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Yes, he can hit the curve.\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          Stick with fast balls, kid.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          You bet.\r\n          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down\r\n          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base\r\n          line. Ray is mightily impressed.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Wow.\r\n\r\n                         SHOELESS JOE\r\n          Damn, this feels good.

Jackson hits it out of\r\n          the park, and beams.

Looking\r\n          around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or\r\n          thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;\r\n          a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage\r\n          as one player hits to several others in the field. A few\r\n          sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.\r\n          Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red\r\n          Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          It could be 1912 out there, for all this\r\n          place has changed.

Ray and Mann are in their fifth\r\n          row seats. They do not speak.\r\n          At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that\r\n          something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just\r\n          watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.\r\n\r\n                         94 THE SCOREBOARD 94\r\n          Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes\r\n          pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant\r\n          replays of some of the action.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         65\r\n\r\n                         94 CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         94\r\n          Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing\r\n          message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the\r\n          crowd fade out.\r\n          There is only the message:\r\n\r\n          ARCHIBALD \"MOONLIGHT\" GRAHAM\r\n          Chisholm, Minn.\r\n          New York Giants\r\n\r\n                         LIFETIME STATISTICS:\r\n          1 Game, 0 At Bats\r\n          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks\r\n          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike\r\n          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.\r\n\r\n          95 RAY AND MANN\r\n\r\n                         95\r\n          Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and\r\n          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he\r\n          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens\r\n          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,\r\n          but cannot see what Ray is writing.\r\n          Then Ray hears The Voice.\r\n\r\n                         THE VOICE\r\n          'Go the distance.'\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Oh my God.\r\n\r\n                         MANN\r\n          What's the matter?\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Nothing.\r\n\r\n                         MANN\r\n          You okay?\r\n          Ray sighs.\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         ;THEN)\r\n          Whenever you wanttogo,wecan go.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         66\r\n\r\n                         95 CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         95\r\n\r\n                         MANN\r\n          What???\r\n\r\n                         RAY\r\n          If you want to go, we can go.\r\n          Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new\r\n          attitude.\r\n\r\n                         MANN\r\n          Then let's go.\r\n          Mann rises and heads up the aisle.

CHISHOLM RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 112\r\n\r\n          Ray walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge\r\n          of a residential street. The Godfather is playing. He\r\n          nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street. He\r\n          passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some\r\n          kind in its unlit front window. He takes another two or\r\n          three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at\r\n          the sign.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         77\r\n\r\n                         113 THE SIGN\r\n\r\n                         113\r\n          It takes a second to make out the image in the dark, but\r\n          it is a head shot of Richard Nixon. Above, it says \"Four\r\n          More Years\". Below, it reads \"Re-Elect The President\".\r\n\r\n                         114 RAY\r\n\r\n          1.14\r\n          is puzzled. He turns and looks at the theatre marquee.\r\n\r\n          115 THE THEATRE MARQUEE\r\n\r\n                          115\r\n           Under the letters that spell out \"The Godfather\", are\r\n           smaller letters that read \"Nominated for 10 Academy\r\n           Awards\".\r\n\r\n                         116 RAY\r\n\r\n                         116\r\n          frowns.

I'd been up with the club for\r\n          most of a month, but hadn't seen any\r\n          action. Just then old John McGraw\r\n          points a bony finger at me and says\r\n          'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up\r\n          like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed\r\n          my glove, and ran out onto the field.\r\n          They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and\r\n          enter.

He plants\r\n          himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top\r\n          end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and\r\n          waits for the pitch.'\r\n          The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.\r\n          As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.\r\n          There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the\r\n          pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it\r\n          is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way\r\n          and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his\r\n          mask.\r\n\r\n                         CATCHER\r\n          Good thing for you that wasn't his\r\n          fastball.\r\n          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a\r\n          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of\r\n          determination.\r\n\r\n                         ARCHIE\r\n          Come on, let's see your fastball.\r\n          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And\r\n          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the\r\n          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately\r\n          appeals to the Umpire.\r\n\r\n                         ARCHIE \u00b0\r\n          Hey, ump, how about a warning?\r\n\r\n                         UMPIRE\r\n          Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed.\r\n          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to\r\n          call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck\r\n          batter, Mel Ott, comes over.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         93\r\n\r\n                         133 CONTINUED (2)\r\n\r\n                         133\r\n\r\n                         OTT\r\n          Okay, kid, first two were high and\r\n          tight, where do you think the next one's\r\n          going to be?\r\n\r\n                         ARCHIE\r\n          Either-low and away, or in my ear.\r\n\r\n                         OTT\r\n          He don't want to load the bases.

He still\r\n          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch\r\n          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.\r\n          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and\r\n          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.\r\n          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center\r\n          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to\r\n          his left, and makes the catch.\r\n          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.\r\n          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline\r\n          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.\r\n          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him\r\n          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his\r\n          cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.\r\n\r\n                         MANN\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          \u0095Look at that.
