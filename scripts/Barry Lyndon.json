PARK - DAY\n</b>\nBrief shot of duel.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tMy father, who was well-known to the\n\tbest circles in this kingdom under\n\tthe name of roaring Harry James, was\n\tkilled in a duel, when I was fifteen\n\tyears old.\n\n<b>EXT.  GARDEN - DAY\n</b>\nMrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a\ndistance.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tMy mother, after her husband's\n\tdeath, and her retirement, lived in\n\tsuch a way as to defy slander.  She\n\trefused all offers of marriage,\n\tdeclaring that she lived now for her\n\tson only, and for the memory of her\n\tdeparted saint.\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET - DAY\n</b>\nMother and son walking together.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tMy mother was the most beautiful\n\twomen of her day.  But if she was\n\tproud of her beauty, to do her\n\tjustice, she was still more proud of\n\ther son, and has said a thousand\n\ttimes to me that I was the\n\thandsomest fellow in the world.\n\n<b>EXT.  CHURCH - DAY\n</b>\nMother and son entering church.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tThe good soul's pleasure was to\n\tdress me; and on Sundays and\n\tHolidays, I turned out in a velvet\n\tcoat with a silver-hilted sword by\n\tmy side, and a gold garter at my\n\tknee as fine as any lord in the\n\tland.  As we walked to church on\n\tSundays, even the most envious souls\n\twould allow that there was not a\n\tprettier pair in the kingdom.\n\n<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY\n</b>\nA picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tMy uncle's family consisted of ten\n\tchildren, and one of them was the\n\tcause of all my early troubles; this\n\twas the belle of the family, my\n\tcousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.\n\n<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nA sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,\nstables, barn and farm.\n\nIdealized images of Dorothy.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tAh!  That first affair, how well one\n\tremembers it!  What a noble\n\tdiscovery it is that the boy makes\n\twhen he finds himself actually and\n\ttruly in love with some one!  A lady\n\twho is skilled in dancing or singing\n\tnever can perfect herself without a\n\tdeal of study in private.  So it is\n\twith the dear creatures who are\n\tskilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for\n\tinstance, was always practicing, and\n\tshe would take poor me to rehearse\n\ther accomplishments upon...\n\nDorothy talking with the exciseman.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\t... or the exciseman, when he came\n\this rounds.\n\nDorothy talking to the steward.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\t... or the steward.\n\nDorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a\nbook.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\t... or the poor curate.\n\nDorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\t... or the young apothecary's lad\n\tfrom Dugan's Town whom I recollect\n\tbeating once for that very reason.\n\nRoderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tThe torments of jealousy she made me\n\tendure were horrible.\n\n<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY\n</b>\nDorothy, like a greyhound released from days of\nconfinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,\nruns at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,\nreturning every moment to Roderick.\n\nShe runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then\nlaughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless\nand staring at her.\n\nAfter catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she\nchallenges Roderick to a race.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tI accept, but I insist on a wager.\n\tThe loser must do whatever the\n\twinner pleases.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tAgreed.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tDo you see the gate at the end of\n\tthe field?  The first to touch it\n\twill be the winner.\n\nThey line up together and start on a count of three.\nDorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,\nand Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of\nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI was certain to win, but I meant to\n\tlose to see what she would order me\n\tto do.\n\nDorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then\nshe goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes\nout and says:\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tYour penalty is to find a cherry-\n\tcolored ribbon which I have hidden\n\tsomewhere on my person.  You are\n\tfree to look for it anywhere you\n\twill, and I will think very little\n\tof you if you do not find it.\n\nThey sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her\npockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then\nher shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and\ncircumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears\nupon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he\ndraws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The\ntickling makes her laugh.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tI feel the ribbon.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tThen you must get it.\n\nRoderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty\nbreasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tWhy are you shaking?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tWith pleasure at finding the ribbon.\n\n<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY\n</b>\nMilitary review.  One hundred English troops, a few\nmounted officers, a small military band, fifty local\npeople.\n\nThe Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best\nand Grogan.\n\nRoderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tAbout this time, the United Kingdom\n\twas in a state of great excitement\n\tfrom the threat generally credited\n\tof a French invasion.  The noblemen\n\tand people of condition in that and\n\tall other parts of the kingdom\n\tshowed their loyalty by raising\n\tregiments of horse and foot to\n\tresist the invaders.  How I envied\n\tthem.  The whole country was alive\n\twith war's alarums; the three\n\tkingdoms ringing with military\n\tmusic, while poor I was obliged to\n\tstay at home in my fustian jacket\n\tand sigh for fame in secret.\n\n<b>INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT\n</b>\nDorothy and Roderick entering.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tOnce, the officers of the Kilwangen\n\tregiment gave a grand ball to which\n\tDorothy persuaded my to take her.\n\nSeveral cuts depicting the evening.\n\nDorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks\npunch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.\n\nRoderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss\nClancy.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI have endured torments in my life,\n\tbut none like that.  Some of the\n\tprettiest girls there offered to\n\tconsole me, for I was the best\n\tdancer in the room, but I was too\n\twretched, and so remained alone all\n\tnight in a state of agony.  I did\n\tnot care for drink, or know the\n\tdreadful comfort of it in those\n\tdays; but I thought of killing\n\tmyself and Dorothy, and most\n\tcertainly of making away with\n\tCaptain Best.\n\n<b>EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN\n</b>\nThe guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tAt last, and at morning, the ball\n\twas over.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAWN\n</b>\nDorothy and Roderick on horseback together.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tSure it's a bitter night, Roderick\n\tdear, and you'll catch cold without\n\ta handkerchief to your neck.\n\nTo this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle\nmade no reply.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tDid you and Miss Clancy have a\n\tpleasant evening, Roderick?  You\n\twere together, I saw, all night.\n\nTo this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,\nand giving a lash to Daisy.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tOh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and\n\tthrow me, you careless creature,\n\tyou.\n\nThe pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's\nwaist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tI hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!\n\tAnd I only danced with her because\n\t-- because -- the person with whom I\n\tintended to dance chose to be\n\tengaged the whole night.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tI had not been in the room five\n\tminutes before I was engaged for\n\tevery single set.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tWere you obliged to dance five times\n\twith Captain Best, and then stroll\n\tout with him into the garden?\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tI don't care a fig for Captain Best;\n\the dances prettily to be sure, and\n\tis a pleasant rattle of a man.  He\n\tlooks well in his regimentals, too;\n\tand if he chose to ask me to dance,\n\thow could I refuse him?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tBut you refused me, Dorothy.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tOh!  I can dance with you any day,\n\tand to dance with your own cousin at\n\ta ball as if you could find no other\n\tpartner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain\n\tBest's a man, and you are only a\n\tboy, and you haven't a guinea in the\n\tworld.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tIf ever I meet him again, you shall\n\tsee which is the best man of the\n\ttwo.  I'll fight him with sword or\n\twith pistol, captain as he is.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tBut Captain Best is already known as\n\ta valiant soldier, and is famous as\n\ta man of fashion in London.  It is\n\tmighty well of you to fight farmers'\n\tboys, but to fight an Englishman is\n\ta very different matter.\n\nRoderick falls silent.\n\n<b>EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN\n</b>\nThey come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,\nsufficiently deep and rocky.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tSuppose, now, Roderick, you, who are\n\tsuch a hero, was passing over the\n\tbridge and the enemy on the other\n\tside.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tI'd draw my sword, and cut my way\n\tthrough them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tWhat, with me on the pillion?  Would\n\tyou kill poor me?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tWell, then, I'll tell you what I'd\n\tdo.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,\n\tand swim you both across, where no\n\tenemy could follow us.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tJump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare\n\tto do any such thing on Daisy.\n\tThere's the captain's horse, Black\n\tGeorge, I've heard say that Captain\n\tBes --\n\nShe never finished the word for, maddened by the continual\nrecurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tHold tight to my waist!\n\nAnd, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the\nparapet, into the deeper water below.\n\nThe horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she\nsinks, and screams as she rises.\n\nRoderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.\n\n<b>INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nVarious cuts showing illness and convalescence.\n\nRoderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.\n\nMother brings a tray of food.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI went home, and was ill speedily of\n\ta fever, which kept me to my bed for\n\ta week.\n\nDorothy visiting him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tDorothy visited me only once, but I\n\tquitted my couch still more\n\tviolently in love than I had been\n\tever before.\n\n<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nThe air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud\namidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs\ndown the road, as brisk as a young fawn.\n\nHe encounters an orderly whistling \"Roast Beef of Old\nEngland,\" as he cleans down a cavalry horse.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tWhose horse, fellow, is that?\n\n<b>\t\t\tORDERLY\n</b>\tFeller, indeed!  The horse belongs\n\tto my captain, and he's a better\n\tfellow nor you any day.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI did not stop to break his bones,\n\tas I would on another occasion, for\n\ta horrible suspicion had come across\n\tme, and I made for the garden as\n\tquickly as I could.\n\nRoderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path\ntogether.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and\nsqueezing her little hand which lies closely nestling\nagainst his arm.\n\nSome distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying\ncourt to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tThe fact is that, during the week of\n\tmy illness, no other than Captain\n\tBest was staying at Castle Dugan,\n\tand making love to Miss Dorothy in\n\tform.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tNo, Dorothy, except for you and four\n\tothers, I vow before all the gods,\n\tmy heart had never felt the soft\n\tflame.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tAh, you men, you men, John, your\n\tpassion is not equal to ours.  We\n\tare like -- like some plant I've\n\tread of -- we bear but one flower,\n\tand then we die!\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tDo you mean you never felt an\n\tinclination for another?\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tNever, my John, but for thee!  How\n\tcan you ask me such a question?\n\nRaising her hand to his lips.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tDarling Dorothea!\n\nRoderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI pulled out a knot of cherry-\n\tcolored ribbons, which she had given\n\tme out of her breast, and which\n\tsomehow I always wore upon me, and\n\tflung them in Captain Best's face,\n\tand rushed out with my little sword\n\tdrawn.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tShe's a liar -- she's a liar,\n\tCaptain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend\n\tyourself, if you are a man!\n\nRoderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while\nDorothy makes the air echo with her screams.\n\nCaptain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.\n\nThough Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small\nby the side of the enormous English captain.\n\nBest turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back\nclutching at his sword.\n\nDorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,\nscreaming:\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tCaptain Best, for Heaven's sake,\n\tspare the child -- he is but an\n\tinfant.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tAnd ought to be whipped for his\n\timpudence, but never fear, Miss\n\tDugan, I shall not touch him, your\n\tfavorite is safe from me.\n\nSo saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of\nribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and\nhanding it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tWhen ladies make presents to\n\tgentlemen, it is time for other\n\tgentlemen to retire...\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tGood heavens, Best!  He is but a boy\n\tand don't signify any more than my\n\tparrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a\n\tbit of ribbon to my own cousin?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\t\t   (roaring)\n\tI'm a man, and will prove it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tYou are perfectly welcome, miss, as\n\tmany yards as you like.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\tMonster!  Your father was a tailor,\n\tand you are always thinking of the\n\tshop.  But I'll have my revenge, I\n\twill!  Roddy, will you see me\n\tinsulted?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tIndeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to\n\thave his blood as sure as my name's\n\tRoderick.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tI'll send for the usher to cane you,\n\tlittle boy, but as for you, miss, I\n\thave the honor to wish you a good\n\tday.\n\nBest takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low\nbow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's\ncousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by\nthe scream.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\tHoity-toity!  John Best, what's the\n\tmatter here?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tI'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.\n\tI have had enough of Miss Dugan here\n\tand your Irish ways.

We'll make\n\tyou used to our ways, or adopt\n\tEnglish ones.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n</b>\tIt's not the English way, for ladies\n\tto have two lovers, and, so, Mr.\n\tDugan, I'll thank you to pay me the\n\tsum you owe me, and I resign all\n\tclaims to this young lady.  If she\n\thas a fancy for school-boys, let her\n\ttake 'em, sir.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\tPooh!  Pooh!

Hang you for a meddling\n\tbrat, your hand is in everybody's\n\tpie.  What business had you to come\n\tbrawling and quarreling here, with\n\ta gentleman who has fifteen hundred\n\ta-year?\n\nMichael runs after Best.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOROTHY\n</b>\t\t   (gasps)\n\tOh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I\n\tshall never leave this spot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n</b>\t\t   (whisper to Dorothy)\n\tThe Captain is gone.\n\nDorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks\ntowards the house.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n</b>\t\t   (in a soothing tone\n\t\t    to Roderick)\n\tThis is a pretty way to recommend\n\tyourself to the family.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\t\t   (shouts after\n\t\t    Michael)\n\tThe man that marries Dorothy Dugan\n\tmust first kill me -- do you mind\n\tthat?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t   (shouting back from\n\t\t    a distance)\n\tPooh, sir.

It's a hard thing to give a\n\tlad counsel who is in such a far-\n\tgone state as you; but, believe me,\n\tI know the world, and if you will\n\tbut follow my advice, you won't\n\tregret having taken it.  Dorothy\n\tDugan has not a penny; you are not a\n\twhit richer.  And, my poor boy,\n\tdon't you see -- though it's a hard\n\tmatter to see -- that she's a flirt,\n\tand does not care a pin for you or\n\tBest either?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tDorothy might love me or not, as she\n\tlikes, but Best will have to fight\n\tme before he marries her!\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n</b>\tFaith, I think you are a lad that's\n\tlikely to keep your word.\n\nHe looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he\nwalks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he\ngoes through the old gate out of the garden.\n\nWhen Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he\nflings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made\nbelieve to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the\nribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and\nbursts into a passion of tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI must have sat for some hours\n\tbemoaning myself on the garden-bench,\n\tfor the dinner-bell clanged as usual\n\tat three o'clock, which wakened me\n\tfrom my reverie.\n\n<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nAs Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's\nsaddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious\nred-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the\nscullion-girls and kitchen people.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAID\n</b>\tThe Englishman's still there, Master\n\tRoderick.  He's there in the parlor.\n\tGo in, and don't let 'im browbeat\n\tyou, Master Roderick.\n\n<b>INT.

Take a glass of\n\tspirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's\n\thealth.\n\nIt is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what\nhappened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,\nand almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the\ncaptain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his\nside, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and\nRoderick looks on as cold as stone.\n\nHis uncle is in high good-humor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tUNCLE\n</b>\tDorothy, divide that merry thought\n\twith the captain!

He generally writes\n\tfor money.  He makes his party with\n\tCalsabigi, the lottery contractor,\n\tthe Russian attaches, two from the\n\tEnglish embassy, my lords Deuceace\n\tand Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,\n\tand a few more.

Then, aiming at Dascher with his\nsecond pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead\nand stretches him out dead on the ground.\n\n<b>EXT.

The point\n\tof honor is not understood by the\n\tcharming sex; and it was with the\n\tgreatest difficulty that we could\n\tkeep them from the table, could get\n\ttheir money if they lost or, if they\n\tpaid, prevent them from using the\n\tmost furious and extraordinary means\n\tof revenge.\n\n<b>EXT.

There is nothing\nto be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,\nand to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the\nstrength to hold in.\n\nThe chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an\nattack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's\nlover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.\n\nSome falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his\npistol.\n\nThe leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.\nDuring the fight, they mortally wound the helpless\nChevalier and two of them are killed.\n\nAfter they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who\nutters some appropriate last words, then dies.\n\nHis servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at\nthe top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,\neach with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten\nor twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready\nto obey his orders.\n\n<b>EXT.

CASINO - NIGHT\n</b>\nAttractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tThe passion for play is stronger\n\tthan the passion for gallantry; the\n\tgamester at Spa has neither time to\n\tstop to consider the merits of a\n\twoman, nor the courage to make\n\tsacrifices for her.\n\n<b>EXT.

They are\naccompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two\nservants.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tIn evoking the recollections of\n\tthese days, I have nothing but\n\tpleasure.  I would if I could say as\n\tmuch of a lady who will henceforth\n\tplay a considerable part in the\n\tdrama of my life -- I mean the\n\tCountess of Cosgrove, whose fatal\n\tacquaintance I made at Spa, very\n\tsoon after the tragic events which\n\tcaused me to quit Germany.\n\nCloser shot of the Countess.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tVictoria, Countess of Cosgrove.

One could not but admire the\n\tspirit and gallantry with which he\n\tpursued his favorite pastime; for,\n\tthough worn out with gout and a\n\tmyriad of diseases, a cripple\n\twheeled about in a chair, and\n\tsuffering pangs of agony, yet you\n\twould see him every morning, and\n\tevery evening at his post behind the\n\tdelightful green cloth.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n</b>\tHang it, Mr. Roderick James, you\n\thave no more manners than a barber,\n\tand I think my black footman has\n\tbeen better educated than you; but\n\tyou are a young fellow of\n\toriginality and pluck, and I like\n\tyou, sir.  because you seem\n\tdetermined to go to the devil by a\n\tway of your own.\n\nLaughter at the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tI am obliged to observe, Sir William\n\tCosgrove, that since you are bound\n\tfor the next world much sooner than\n\tI am, I will depend on you to get\n\tcomfortable quarters arranged for\n\tme.\n\nLaughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n</b>\tIndeed, you are right, sir.  Look at\n\tme.  Marriage has added forty years\n\tto my life.  I am dying, a worn-out\n\tcripple, at the age of fifty.  When\n\tI took off Lady Cosgrove, there was\n\tno man of my years who looked so\n\tyoung as myself.  Fool that I was!\n\tI had enough with my pensions,\n\tperfect freedom, the best society in\n\tEurope -- and I gave up all these,\n\tand married and was miserable.  Take\n\ta warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and\n\tstick to the trumps.

For instance, I have\n\tgot the gout; who tends me?  A hired\n\tvalet who robs me whenever he has\n\tthe power.  My wife never comes near\n\tme.  What friend have I?  None in\n\tthe wide world.  Men of the world,\n\tas you and I are, don't make\n\tfriends, and we are fools for our\n\tpains.\n\nPolite laughter at the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n</b>\tMy lady is a weak woman, but she is\n\tmy mistress.  She is a fool, but she\n\thas got the better of one of the\n\tbest heads in Christendom.  She is\n\tenormously rich, but somehow I have\n\tnever been so poor, as since I\n\tmarried her.  I thought to better\n\tmyself, and she has made me\n\tmiserable and killed me, and she\n\twill do as much for my successor\n\twhen I'm gone.\n\nThere is a reflective silence at the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tHas her ladyship a very large\n\tincome?\n\nThis question causes Sir William to burst out into a\nyelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes\nRoderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.\n\n<b>EXT.

A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,\nsome dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of\ntrees.\n\nRoderick approaches the Countess.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tDespite my friend's strong warning.\n\tI resolves to become acquainted with\n\this lady.

COACH - DAY\n</b>\nThe Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and\nsmiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tWhen a man is going to the devil,\n\thow easy and pleasant a journey it\n\tis!  The thought of the money quite\n\tput me in a good humor, and my wife,\n\tas she lay on my shoulder in the\n\tpost-chaise, going to London, said\n\tit was the happiest ride she had\n\ttaken since our marriage.\n\n<b>EXT.  INN - DUSK\n</b>\nThe carriage stops and they disembark.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tOne night we stayed at Reading.\n\n<b>INT.  INN - NIGHT\n</b>\nRoderick and his wife at dinner.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tMy lady and I agreed that, with the\n\tmoney, we would go to France, and\n\twait there for better times, and\n\tthat night, over our supper, formed\n\ta score of plans both for pleasure\n\tand retrenchment.  You would have\n\tthought it was Darby and Joan\n\ttogether over their supper.\n\n<b>INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nRoderick and his wife making love.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tO woman!  Woman!  When I recollect\n\tLady Cosgrove's smiles and\n\tblandishments, how happy she seemed\n\tto be on that night!  What an air of\n\tinnocent confidence appeared in her\n\tbehavior, and what affectionate\n\tnames she called me!  I am lost in\n\twonder at the depth of her\n\thypocrisy.  Who can be surprised\n\tthat an unsuspecting person like\n\tmyself should have been a victim to\n\tsuch a consummate deceiver?\n\n<b>EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nThe coach drives up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tWe were in London at three o'clock,\n\tan half-an-hour before the time\n\tappointed.\n\n<b>INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY\n</b>\nRoderick and the Countess looking for the office.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI easily found out Mr. Tapewell's\n\tapartment:  a gloomy den it was, and\n\tin an unlucky hour, I entered it.\n\nThey climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and\nthe dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.\n\nThe Countess seems agitated and faint.\n\nWhen they get to the door, she stops in front of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n</b>\tRoderick -- don't go in.  I am sure\n\tthere is danger.  There's time yet,\n\tlet us go back -- anywhere!\n\nThe Countess has put herself before the door in a\ntheatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.\n\nHe pushes her away to one side.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tLady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n</b>\tOld fool!\n\nShe jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a\nmoldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n</b>\tSay Lady Cosgrove is here!\n\nShe stalks down the passage, muttering:  \"Old Fool.\"\n\n<b>INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nTapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his\nparchments and tin boxes.\n\nHe advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and\npoints towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,\nrather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.\n\nThe lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back\nin a moment.\n\nIn the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another\nlayer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons\nand pistols, and Lord Brookside.\n\nLady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,\ncrying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her\npreserver, her gallant knight.\n\nThen, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of\ninvective which quite astonishes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n</b>\tOh fool as I am, I have outwitted\n\tthe most crafty and treacherous\n\tmonster under the sun.  Yes, I was a\n\tfool when I married you, and gave up\n\tother and nobler hearts for your\n\tsake -- yes, I was a fool when I\n\tforgot my name and lineage to unite\n\tmyself with a base-born adventurer\n\t-- a fool to bear, without repining,\n\tthe most monstrous tyranny that ever\n\twoman suffered; to allow my property\n\tto be squandered; to see women as\n\tbase and low-born as yourself...\n\n<b>\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n</b>\tFor heaven's sake, be calm.\n\nTapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a\nthreatening look in Roderick's eye.\n\nThe Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,\nscreaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and\nalways beginning and ending the sentence with the word\n\"fool.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tYou didn't tell all, my lady -- I\n\tsaid \"old\" fool.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n</b>\tI have no doubt that you said and\n\tdid, sir, everything that a\n\tblackguard could say or do.  This\n\tlady is now safe under the\n\tprotection of her relations and the\n\tlaw, and need fear your infamous\n\tpersecutions no longer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tBut you are not safe, and as sure as\n\tI am a man of honor, I will have\n\tyour heart's blood.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n</b>\tTake down his words, constables;\n\tswear the peace against him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n</b>\tI would not sully my sword with the\n\tblood of such a ruffian.  If the\n\tscoundrel remains in London another\n\tday, he will be seized as a common\n\tswindler.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tWhere's the man who will seize me?\n\nHe draws his sword, placing his back to the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tLet the scoundrel come!  You -- you\n\tcowardly braggart, come first, if\n\tyou have the soul of a man!\n\nThe Countess and the bailiffs move away.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n</b>\tWe are not going to seize you!  My\n\tdear sir, we don't wish to seize\n\tyou; we will give you a handsome sum\n\tto leave the country, only leave her\n\tladyship in peace.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n</b>\tAnd the country will be rid of such\n\ta villain.\n\nAs Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.\n\nThe lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the\ncompany of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI was no longer the man I was at\n\ttwenty, when I should have charged\n\tthe ruffians, sword in hand, and\n\tsent at least one of them to his\n\taccount.  I was broken in spirit,\n\tregularly caught in the toils,\n\tutterly baffled and beaten by that\n\twoman.  Was she relenting at the\n\tdoor, when she paused and begged me\n\tto turn back?  Had she not a\n\tlingering love for me still?  Her\n\tconduct showed it, as I came to\n\treflect on it.  It was my only\n\tchance now left in the world, so I\n\tput down my sword upon the lawyers\n\tdesk.\n\nRoderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tGentlemen, I shall have no violence;\n\tyou may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite\n\tready to speak with him when he is\n\tat leisure.\n\nRoderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.\n\n<b>EXT.

RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n</b>\tI was instructed to take a lodging\n\tfor the night in a coffee house near\n\tGray's Inn, and anxiously expected a\n\tvisit from Mr. Tapewell.\n\nTapewell talking to Roderick.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n</b>\tI have been authorized by Lady\n\tCosgrove and her advisors to pay you\n\tan annuity of 300 pounds a year,\n\tspecifically on the condition of you\n\tremaining abroad out of the three\n\tkingdoms, and to be stopped on the\n\tinstant of your return.  I advise\n\tyou to accept it without delay for\n\tyou know, as well as I do, that your\n\tstay in London will infallibly\n\tplunge you in gaol, as there are\n\tinnumerable writs taken out against\n\tyou here and in the west of England,\n\tand that your credit is so blown\n\tupon that you could not hope to\n\traise a shilling.  I will leave you\n\tthe night to consider this proposal,\n\tbut if you refuse, the family will\n\tproceed against you in London, and\n\thave you arrested.  If you accede, a\n\tquarter salary will be paid to you\n\tat any foreign port you should\n\tprefer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRODERICK\n</b>\tMr. Tapewell, I do not require a\n\tnight to consider this proposal.\n\tWhat other choice has a poor, lonely\n\tand broken-hearted man?  I shall\n\ttake the annuity, and leave the\n\tcountry.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMR. TAPEWELL\n</b>\tI am very glad to hear that you have\n\tcome to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.\n\tI think you are very wise.\n\nThere is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.\nBrookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.\n\nThe dialogue for this scene has to be written.\n\nBrookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to\nhave Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out\nagainst him for debt.\n\nMr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that\nBrookside is acting in bad faith.\n\nBrookside brushes aside his objections.\n\nRoderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.\n\nThe following lines are read over Roderick being shackled\nand led out of the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNARRATOR\n</b>\tMr. James Cosgrove's personal\n\tnarrative finishes here, for the\n\thand of death interrupted the\n\tingenious author soon after the\n\tperiod which this memoir was\n\tcompiled, after he had lived\n\tnineteen years an inmate of the\n\tFleet Prison, where the prison\n\trecords state he died of delirium\n\ttremens.\n\n<b>EXT.
