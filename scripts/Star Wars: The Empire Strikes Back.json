GALAXY - PLANET HOTH\n</b>\nA Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots \nfrom its underside.  \n\nOne of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-\ncovered surface.  An explosion marks the point of\nimpact.  \n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY\n</b>\nA weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A \nstrange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the \nsmoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the \nsnow plain and disappears into the distance.\n\n<b>EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY\n</b>\nA small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled \nrider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving \nplumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged \nbeast.\n\nThe rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling \noff his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the \nsky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and \nthrough them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.\n\nThe wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink \ntransmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t\t(into comlink)\n\t\tEcho Three to Echo Seven.

What's the \n\t\tmatter?  You smell something?\n\nLuke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when \nsuddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a \nmonstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over \nhim.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tAaargh!\n\nLuke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white \nclaw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified \nscreams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck \nbeing broken.\n\nThe Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away \nacross the frozen plain.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY\n</b>\nA stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous \nice cave.\n\n<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\n</b>\nRebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing \ntheir new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls \noff his goggles.\n\nHe walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which \nis parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various \nother droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his \nWookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie \nstops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated \ngreeting to his boss.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tChewie!\n\nThe Wookiee grumbles a reply.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tAll right, don't lose your temper.\n\t\tI'll come right back and give you \n\t\ta hand.\n\nChewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han \nleaves.\n\n<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nA makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick \nice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, \ntroops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and \nmonitoring radar signals.\n\nGeneral Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRIEEKAN\n</b>\t\tSolo?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>No sign of life out there, General.\nThe sensors are in place.

I \n\t\tcan't stay anymore.\n\nPrincess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short \nwhite combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in \na Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat \ndistressed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRIEEKAN\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry to hear that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tWell, there's a price on my head.\n\t\tIf I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, \n\t\tI'm a dead man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRIEEKAN\n</b>\t\tA death mark's not an easy thing \n\t\tto live with.

Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his \nhead and adopts a sarcastic tone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\t\t(cooly)\n\t\tWell, don't get all mushy on me.\n\t\tSo long, Princess.\n\nHan walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  \nLeia stews a moment, then hurries after him.\n\n<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tHan!\n\nHan stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tYes, Your Highnessness?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tI thought you decided to stay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tWell, the bounty hunter we ran \n\t\tinto on Ord Mantell changed my\n\t\tmind.  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tHan, we need you!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tWe?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tOh, what about you need?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\t\t(mystified)\n\t\tI need?

You could use \n\t\ta good kiss!\n\nAngrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.\n\n<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR\n</b>\nA familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-\nDetoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an \nice wall toward the main hangar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tDon't try to blame me.

HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK\n</b>\nThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of \na Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy \nstalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One \nside of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens \nhis eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the \ngorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and \nfutilely tries to unfasten the throngs.\n\nExhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, \nhe spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about \nthree feet out of reach.\n\nHe focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he \nsqueezes his eyes tight in concentration.\n\nJust as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into \nLuke's hand.\n\nThe young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts \nhimself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The \nstartled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke \nscrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams \nin pain.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK\n</b>\nLuke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak \nand exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK\n</b>\nA small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile \nvastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up \nlarge clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE\t\t\t\t HANGAR - DUSK\n</b>\nArtoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves \nstiffly over to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tYou must come along now, Artoo.  \n\t\tThere's really nothing more we can \n\t\tdo.  And my joints are freezing up.\n\nArtoo beeps, long and low.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tDon't say thing like that!  Of \n\t\tcourse we'll see Master Luke again.\n\t\tHe'll be quite all right, you'll see.\n\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tStupid little short-circuit.  He'll \n\t\tbe quite all right.\n\nThreepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully \nkeeps his vigil.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK\n</b>\nThe wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, \nbut a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, \nbut he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple \nof feet and then collapses.\n\n<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n</b>\nPrincess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, \nwaiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold \nwind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the \nbackground, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.  \n\nA Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with \nthe princess.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n</b>\t\tSir, all the patrols are in.\n\t\tThere's still no contact from \n\t\tSkywalker or Solo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tMistress Leia, Artoo says he's been \n\t\tquite unable to pick up any signals, \n\t\talthough he does admit that his own \n\t\trange is far too weak to abandon \n\t\tall hope.\n\nLeia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDERLIN\n</b>\t\tYour Highness, there's nothing \n\t\tmore we can do tonight.

Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, \nsomewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex \nseries of efficient beeps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tArtoo says the chances of survival \n\t\tare seven hundred seventy-five...\n\t\tto one.\n\nLeia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the \nentrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge \ncavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tActually, Artoo has been known to \n\t\tmake mistakes... from time to time.\n\t\tOh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry \n\t\tabout Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll \n\t\tbe all right.  He's quite clever, \n\t\tyou know... for a human being.\n\n<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK\n</b>\nLuke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks \nup and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is \nhard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tLuke...

Ben.\n\nLuke drops into unconsciousness.\n\nHan pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered \nfriend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, \npitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him \nurgently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tLuke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.  \n\t\tCome on, give me a sign here.\n\nLuke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping \nLuke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a \nrasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun \nstagger and then fall over into the snow.\n\nHan carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the \nTauntaun expires.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN \n</b>\t\tNot much time.\n\nHe pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t\t(moaning)\n\t\tBen...

He \nquickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's \ninert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\t\t(reeling from the \n\t\t\t odor) \n\t\tWhew...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tDagobah...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tThis may smell bad, kid...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t\t(moaning)\n\t\tYoda...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\t...but it will keep you warm... \n\t\ttil I get the shelter built.\n\t\t\t(struggling to get \n\t\t\t Luke inside the \n\t\t\t carcass) \n\t\tOoh... I thought they smelled bad \n\t\ton the outside!\n\nThe wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han \nremoves a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter \ncontainer.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection \nagainst a bitter Hoth night.\n\n<b>EXT.

Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in \nevery direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium \nFalcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain \nof rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the \nasteroids.\n\nOne of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and \nexplodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of \nsmaller explosions.\n\nTwo huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly \nbanks around both of them.

He manages a short peek at the \ncockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.  \nHan gives her a quick look.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tYou said you wanted to be around \n\t\twhen I made a mistake; well, this \n\t\tcould be it, sweetheart.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tI take it back.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT\n</b>\nThe Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized \nasteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the \nstarry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.  \nThe two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.  \nThe Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, \nsmall asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.\n\nThe TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles \ndirectly into their path.

Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs \nwere being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the \nspacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.\n\n<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK\n</b>\nThe mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  \nLuke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out \nof his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which \nis barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make \nout are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tNo, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll \n\t\thave a look around.\n\nArtoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses \nhis balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tArtoo?\n\nLuke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water \nis still and reveals no sign of the little droid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tArtoo!  Where are you?\n\nA small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is \nheard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.

You be more careful.\n\nThe outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.\n\nLuke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and \nturns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward \nshore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tArtoo - that way!\n\nSuddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving \ntoward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the \nswampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The \ndroid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.\n\nHolding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into \nthe murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tArtoo!\n\nThe black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin \nto appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the \nwater, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of \nsoft gray moss.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tOh, no!  Are you all right?  Come \n\t\ton.  You're lucky you don't taste \n\t\tvery good.  Anything broken?\n\nLuke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from \nhis round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tIf you're saying coming here was \n\t\ta bad idea, I'm beginning to agree \n\t\twith you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we \n\t\tdoing here?  It's like... something \n\t\tout of a dream, or, I don't know.  \n\t\tMaybe I'm just going crazy.\n\nAs Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, \nArtoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.\n\n<b>EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER\n</b>\nAdmiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.\n\nAfter a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising \nsight before him.\n\nDarth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far \nside of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the \nvarious apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts \nfrom Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar \ntissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet \nonto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face \nPiett.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tYes, Admiral?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPIETT\n</b>Our ships have sighted the \nMillennium Falcon, lord.

Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia \nacross the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as \nsuddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they \nare in each other's arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tLet go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tSshh!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tLet go, please.\n\nLeia flushes, averting her eyes.

DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK\n</b>\nThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking \nswamp.\n\nLuke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.

The young \nwarrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the \nspeaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, \nbluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing \nis dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t\t(looking at the \n\t\t\t creature)\n\t\tLike we're being watched!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n</b>\t\tAway with your weapon!

CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM\n</b>\nThe room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four \nUgnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some \npieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten \nmetal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie \nenters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting \nThreepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, \nthen reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from \nhim to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until \nThreepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the \nground.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY\n</b>\nThe door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of \nThreepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tWhat happened?\n\nChewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tWhere?

At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  \nStanding at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty \nhunter.\n\nFaster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a \ncouple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his \nhand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they \nexplode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's \nhand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of \nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tWe would be honored if you would \n\t\tjoin us.\n\nHan gives Lando a mean look.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tI had no choice.

To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle \nscreeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant \nfists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper \nlights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a \nwall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he \nmoves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He \npicks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, \nbarking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on \nits torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.\n\nSuddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches \ntwo connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his \nvoice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tMmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take \n\t\tthis off!

Darth Vader \nand Lando stand near the platform.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tThis facility is crude, but it \n\t\tshould be adequate to freeze \n\t\tSkywalker for his journey to the \n\t\tEmperor.\n\nAn Imperial soldier appears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tIMPERIAL SOLDIER\n</b>\t\tLord Vader, ship approaching.\n\t\tX-wing class.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tGood.

SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING\n</b>\nLuke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.\n\n<b>INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT\n</b>\nEncountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n</b>\nThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six \nUgnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special \ncoffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a \nsquad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to \nChewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is \nThreepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's \nand the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see \nwhat is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, \nintermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The \nremaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back \nso that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tIf only you had attached my legs, \n\t\tI wouldn't be in this ridiculous \n\t\tposition.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, \n\t\tyou have a responsibility to me, \n\t\tso don't do anything foolish.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\t\t(to Lando)\n\t\tWhat's going on... buddy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tYou're being put into carbon freeze.\n\nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n</b>\t\tWhat if he doesn't survive?  He's \n\t\tworth a lot to me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tThe Empire will compensate you \n\t\tif he dies.  Put him in!\n\nRealizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and \nattacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other \nImperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee \nwith their laser weapons.\n\nFrom the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in \npanic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tOh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, \n\t\tChewbacca, stop...!\n\nThe stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tStop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear \n\t\tme?  Stop!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tYes, stop, please!  I'm not ready \n\t\tto die.\n\nHan breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him \ngo and the pirate breaks up the fight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tChewie!  Chewie, this won't help \n\t\tme.  Hey!\n\nHan gives the Wookiee a stern look.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tSave your strength.  There'll be \n\t\tanother time.  The princess - you \n\t\thave to take care of her.  You \n\t\thear me?\n\nHan winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.\n\nIn a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too \ndistraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look \nsorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a \nfinal, passionate kiss.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tI love you!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAN\n</b>\t\tI know.\n\nTears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to \nthe hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and \nthen, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in \nagony.\n\nLando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.\n\nInstantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and \nfluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns \naway from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tWhat... what's going on?  Turn \n\t\tround, Chewbacca, I can't see.  \n\t\tOh... they've encased him in \n\t\tcarbonite.  He should be quite \n\t\twell-protected - if he survives \n\t\tthe freezing process, that is.\n\nChewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an \nangry glance and bark.\n\nA huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate \nout of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush \nover and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the \ncoffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it \ninside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step \naway.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He \nshakes his head in relief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tWell, Calrissian, did he survive?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tYes, he's alive.  And in perfect \n\t\thibernation.\n\nVader turns to Boba Fett.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tHe's all yours bounty hunter.\n\t\tReset the chamber for Skywalker.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tIMPERIAL OFFICER\n</b>\t\tSkywalker has just landed, my \n\t\tlord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tGood.

CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\nAs Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a \ngroup of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited \nseries of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops \nin his tracks with a feeble squeak.\n\nBoba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the \nfloating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, \nimmediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon \nand blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The \ntwo guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and \nfires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a \nhuge chunk of wall.\n\nLuke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, \nHan, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  \nLuke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a \nsecond hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time \nto see Luke.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tLuke!  Luke, don't - it's a \n\t\ttrap!  It's a trap!\n\nBefore she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears \nfrom sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing \nbehind.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM\n</b>\nLuke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the \nothers are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the \ncorridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes \nslamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, \nechoing through the chamber.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM\n</b>\nArtoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He \nwhistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the \nother direction.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM\n</b>\nLuke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an \nopening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he \nstands on begins to move.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n</b>\nLuke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is \ndeathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else \nseems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.\n\nSteam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, \nLuke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters \nhis gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, \neager to engage his enemy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tThe Force is with you, young \n\t\tSkywalker.  But you are not a \n\t\tJedi yet.\n\nLuke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is \nlit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and \nthe swords of the two combatants clash in battle.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\n</b>\nLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, \nguarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where \nLobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.\n\nThe guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  \nTaking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia \nand one to Lando.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tWell done.  Hold them in the \n\t\tsecurity tower - and keep it \n\t\tquiet.

EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY\n</b>\nAn elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a \nlarge bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.\n\nJust as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset \nsky.  \n\nIn wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tOh, no!  Chewie, they're behind \n\t\tyou!\n\nA laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what \nThreepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad \nof stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the \nelevator.\n\nLeia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break \nfor the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess \nand the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out \nof the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely \nnotice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of \ncaptivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.\n\nBut after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser \nfire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut \nand the stormtroopers race forward.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n</b>\nLuke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the \nchamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively \ndrives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tYou have learned much, young one.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tYou'll find I'm full of surprises.\n\nVader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and \nsending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the \nyouth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls \ndown the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he \nsprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up \nto see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls \naway as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his \nenemy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tYour destiny lies with me, \n\t\tSkywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to \n\t\tbe true.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tNo!\n\nBehind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All \nthe while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.\n\nSuddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and \nfalls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant \nfreezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and \ndeactivates his sword.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tAll to easy.  Perhaps you are not \n\t\tas strong as the Emperor thought.\n\nThrough the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal \nbegins to pour into the pit.\n\nVader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped \nfifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the \ncarbonite outlet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tImpressive... most impressive.\n\nLuke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the \nsteaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had \nfallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his \noutstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights \nhis sword as well.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tObi-Wan has taught you well.  You \n\t\thave controlled your fear... now \n\t\trelease your anger.\n\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as \nVader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he \nhas been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  \nAnother exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tOnly your hatred can destroy me.\n\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  \nHe lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to \nfill up with steam.\n\nVader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, \nbut looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The \nenergy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of \ncollapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of \nVader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers \nhimself into the pit.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM\n</b>\nMoving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the \nreactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward \na large window as Vader enters.\n\nLuke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.\n\nBehind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall \nand comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in \nhalf just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, \nLuke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an \ninvisible shield.\n\nA large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  \nSparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  \nSmall tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all \nsides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is \nbloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes \nflying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, \nunmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.\n\nA piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.\n\n<b>INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT\n</b>\nLuke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his \ndeactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to \nscramble up.\n\n<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM\n</b>\nLeia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the \ndoor to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a \nmoment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as \nstormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a \nrain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando \npunches desperately at the door's control panel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tThe security codes has been changed!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n</b>\t\tArtoo, you can tell the computer \n\t\tto override the security system.\n\nThreepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.

Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's \ncircuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out \nunderneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tThis way.\n\nLando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.

The black armor sparks \nand smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.\n\nLuke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at \nhim, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick \nmove around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  \nVader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins \nto fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.\n\nLuke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, \nVader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his \nhand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his \nforearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its \nextreme end.  Vader\nfollows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.

It is the \n\t\tonly way.\n\nVader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.\n\nA calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant \nhe steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over \nthe platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow \nat Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the \nedge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, \nunable to grab onto anything to break his fall.\n\n<b>INT. REACTOR SHAFT\n</b>\nSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  \nWhen Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.\n\n<b>INT. EXHAUST PIPE\n</b>\nLuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.\n\nHe slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet \nhit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of \nthe pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.\n\n<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK\n</b>\nUnable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the \nundermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to \ngrab onto on electronic weather vane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tBen... Ben, please!\n\nLuke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  \nHe hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the \nwhile, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust \npipe.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tBen.  Leia!\n\nThere is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the\nweather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tHear me!  Leia!\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n</b>\nLeia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is \nbusy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a \nreadout on the control panel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tLuke...

CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK\n</b>\nThe Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.\n\n<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM\n</b>\nVader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the \nFalcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.\n\nHe turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing \nplatform.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVADER\n</b>\t\tBring my shuttle.\n\n<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE\n</b>\nNearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his \nbody shifts in the wind.\n\n<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\n</b>\nThe Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE \nfighter close in on the starship.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON\n</b>\nLeia tries to remain calm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\t\t(pointing out the \n\t\t\t cockpit window)\n\t\tLook, someone's up there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tIt's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.\n\t\tSlow down and we'll get under him.\n\t\tLando, open the top hatch.\n\nLando rushes out of the cockpit.\n\n<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE\n</b>\nLuke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips \nfrom the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks \ntoward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up \nthrough the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally \nfalls from the vane into space.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n</b>\nOut the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the \ncity.  The ship gains on him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tOkay.  Easy, Chewie.\n\nThe Falcon closes in on Luke.\n\n<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\n</b>\nThree TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH\n</b>\nThe hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help \nthe battered warrior inside the ship.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n</b>\nFlak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia \nand Chewie struggle with the controls.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\t\t(into intercom)\n\t\tLando?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\t\t(over intercom)\n\t\tOkay, let's go.\n\n<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\n</b>\nThe Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, \nall of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n</b>\nExplosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.  \nChewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.\n\nLeia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the \ncockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie \nbarks in joyous relief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tOh, Leia.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tAll right, Chewie.  Let's go.\n\nLeia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.\n\n<b>EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY\n</b>\nThe Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from \nthe cloud-covered city.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS\n</b>\nLuke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.  \nLeia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tI'll be back.\n\nShe kisses him, then leaves the quarters.\n\n<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n</b>\nAll over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches \nthe flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some \nswitches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing \non the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the \nshape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tStar Destroyer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tAll right, Chewie.  Ready for \n\t\tlight-speed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tIf your people fixed the \n\t\thyperdrive.\n\nAnother explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the \npanel next to her flashes on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEIA\n</b>\t\tAll the coordinates are set.\n\t\tIt's now or never.\n\nChewie barks in agreement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tPunch it!\n\nThe Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The \nsound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, \nexpectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets \nout a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLANDO\n</b>\t\tThey told me they fixed it.  I \n\t\ttrusted them to fix it.  It's not \n\t\tmy fault!\n\nChewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives \nLando and angry shove as he storms past him.\n\n<b>EXT.

He is trying to loosen something with an \nenormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits \nthe panel...\n\n<b>INT.

Vader \nturns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back \nin a contemplative gesture.\n\n<b>EXT.

Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel \ntransport ship hovers near the fleet.\n\n<b>INT.

The medical droid makes some adjustments in \na tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tOw!\n\nLuke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is \ncompletely functional.\n\nHe gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a \nnew understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about \nhis uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the \nlarge window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star \nCruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.\n\nLuke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and \nThreepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.
