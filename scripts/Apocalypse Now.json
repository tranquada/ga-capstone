A mist clings to the \n\ttrees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.\n\n\tOur VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to \n\tthe tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;\n\tthen another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to \n\temerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set \n\tof beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, \n\tin a psychedelic  hand, are the words: \"Gook Killer.\" \n\tThe head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier \n\tbeneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no \n\tshirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is\n\tpainted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the \n\tright; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and\n\tslowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.\n\n\tOur VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though \n\tunrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.\n\tWe PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the\n\tswamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can\n\tin the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.\n\tAs we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow \n\tand houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted\n\tin a paisley design.\n\n\tNow the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST\n\tthe glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in\n\tambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.\n\tACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black\n\tpajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.\n\tTheir feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make\n\tno sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of\n\teyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.\n\n\tThe VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER\n\tAND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front\n\tabout ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags\n\tand bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun\n\tcasually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles\n\tlaconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH\n\tUS. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out \n\twith AUTOMATIC FIRE.\n\n\tOut VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,\n\tscreaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS\n\tappear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that\n\twe fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.\n\tSome wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from\n\tfeathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long\n\tsavage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;\n\tthey wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.\n\tThey wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their\n\tbodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.\n\tThey appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US\n\tas they move.\n\n\tThe soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping\n\tmud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.\n\n\tWe begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly\n\trunning for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,\n\tonly to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN\n\tpainted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW\n\tFALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME\n\tand EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die\n\taround us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS\n\tare piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is\n\tfrightened.\n\n\tAn AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign\n\ton it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down\n\tTOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the\n\tdead.\n\n\tOUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a\n\tVietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be\n\tstopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS\n\twith primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth\n\tand green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US\n\tand the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,\n\tbright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,\n\telectric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :\n\n\n\t\t<u>MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW</u>\n\n\n<b>\t2  TITLE SEQUENCE\n</b>\n\tThe CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, \n\tgrowing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;\n\ttransforming into an intense white heat that we can barely\n\tlook at, like the sun itself.\n\n\tThen it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once\n\tagain. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It\n\tis as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of\n\tcooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more\n\tdistant. The TITLES CONTINUE.\n\n\tWe are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the\n\tstars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the\n\tMUSIC  now.\n\n\tWe MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,\n\tas though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.\n\n\tWe are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,\n\tclose enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;\n\tCLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;\n\tLos Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like\n\tshapes of :\n\n\n<b>\t3  EXT.

They are drinking\n\tcocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the\n\thead of a large American Corporation, and this is his\n\tparty. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to\n\tcatch some of the late sun. Others have their faces\n\tsmeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war\n\tpaint.

The lounge is fairly\n\tcrowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly\n\tpast the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching\n\tsight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.\n\n\tAn INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of\n\tdrinks and approaches Willard's table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tHow about a drink ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tSure, thanks.\n\n\tHe sits down at the table with the drinks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tWinning the war by yourself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\t\t(he calls for the waiter)\n\t\tPart.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tWhich part is that ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tMy part.\n<b>\t\t\t(TO THE WAITER)\n</b>\t\tBeer, with ice and water.\n\n<b>\t   \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tThat's good gin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tI'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tDelta ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\t\tNorth ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tYeah.

When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly\n\tloud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid\n\tstream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as\n\t7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of\n\tthe lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-\n\tgeant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally\n\tas the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is\n\tblown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.\n\n\n<b>\t263  VIEW ON WILLARD\n</b>\n\tExhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n</b>\t\tNapalm.\n\n\tColby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-\n\tluminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES\n\tbeautiful, like a magnificent firework.\n\n\n<b>\t264  VIEW ON KURTZ\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n</b>\t\tClaymores, claymores.\n\n\tThe SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS\n\tpenetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.\n\tKurtz's face is illuminated by each of these.

NVA have reached\n\tthe walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.\n\tSuddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce\n\tweird psychedelic light.

They break the charge and continue\n\tcutting their way through the NVA masses like torches \n\tthrough metal.\n\n\n<b>\t271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ\n</b>\n\tKurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain.

Kurtz looks at him, his\n\tgun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his\n\tholster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz\n\tbeats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He\n\tmoves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding\n\tit at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls\n\tand FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and\n\trush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly\n\tencircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The\n\tmachine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle.
