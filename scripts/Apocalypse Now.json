A mist clings to the \n\ttrees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.\n\n\tOur VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to \n\tthe tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;\n\tthen another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to \n\temerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set \n\tof beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, \n\tin a psychedelic  hand, are the words: \"Gook Killer.\" \n\tThe head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier \n\tbeneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no \n\tshirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is\n\tpainted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the \n\tright; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and\n\tslowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.\n\n\tOur VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though \n\tunrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.\n\tWe PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the\n\tswamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can\n\tin the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.\n\tAs we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow \n\tand houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted\n\tin a paisley design.\n\n\tNow the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST\n\tthe glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in\n\tambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.\n\tACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black\n\tpajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.\n\tTheir feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make\n\tno sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of\n\teyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.\n\n\tThe VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER\n\tAND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front\n\tabout ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags\n\tand bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun\n\tcasually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles\n\tlaconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH\n\tUS. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out \n\twith AUTOMATIC FIRE.\n\n\tOut VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,\n\tscreaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS\n\tappear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that\n\twe fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.\n\tSome wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from\n\tfeathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long\n\tsavage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;\n\tthey wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.\n\tThey wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their\n\tbodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.\n\tThey appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US\n\tas they move.\n\n\tThe soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping\n\tmud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.\n\n\tWe begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly\n\trunning for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,\n\tonly to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN\n\tpainted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW\n\tFALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME\n\tand EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die\n\taround us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS\n\tare piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is\n\tfrightened.\n\n\tAn AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign\n\ton it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down\n\tTOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the\n\tdead.\n\n\tOUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a\n\tVietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be\n\tstopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS\n\twith primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth\n\tand green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US\n\tand the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,\n\tbright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,\n\telectric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :\n\n\n\t\tMAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW\n\n\n\t2  TITLE SEQUENCE\n\n\tThe CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, \n\tgrowing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;\n\ttransforming into an intense white heat that we can barely\n\tlook at, like the sun itself.\n\n\tThen it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once\n\tagain. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It\n\tis as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of\n\tcooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more\n\tdistant. The TITLES CONTINUE.\n\n\tWe are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the\n\tstars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the\n\tMUSIC  now.\n\n\tWe MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,\n\tas though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.\n\n\tWe are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,\n\tclose enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;\n\tCLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;\n\tLos Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like\n\tshapes of :\n\n\n\t3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY\n\n\tThe VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin\n\tcruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.\n\n\tIt is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in\n\tbathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking\n\tcocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the\n\thead of a large American Corporation, and this is his\n\tparty. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to\n\tcatch some of the late sun. Others have their faces\n\tsmeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war\n\tpaint. Charlie is going on and on :\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t... It's crazy -- sugar is up to\n\t\t200 dollars a ton -- sugar !\n\n\t\t\t\tLAWYER\n\t\tWhat about oil ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tFood, oil --look, let me show you\n\t\tsomething. This is the economy of\n\t\tthe United States in two years --\n\n\tHe takes a newspaper, draws a circle.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThis is West Germany.\n\t\t\t(he draws another,\n\t\t\t bigger circle)\n\t\tThis is Japan.\n\t\t\t(another , bigger)\n\t\tThis is Italy.\n\t\t\t(a dot)\n\t\tThis is Iran.\n\t\t\t(a very big circle)\n\t\tAnd this is Saudi Arabia... In\n\t\ttwo years ?\n\t\t\t(a gigantic circle)\n\t\tDo you understand ?\n\n\t\t\t\tACCOUNTANT\n\t\tWhat's to prevent it ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tMaybe nothing. But I'll tell you,\n\t\tI didn't build a two-billion-dollar\n\t\tcompany in the last twenty years\n\t\tby doing nothing. We can protect\n\t\tour interests.\n\t\t\t(pause, for a drink)\n\t\tWe are still the most powerful\n\t\tnation in the world. Militarily.\n\n\tHe leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know bodyguard; he was a\n\t\tcaptain in Viet Nam. You talk to\n\t\thim, except he won't talk. This\n\t\tkind of man can kill you with his\n\t\tpinky. A nice quiet fella, though.\n\n\tThe VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCarries a attache case at all\n\t\ttimes. You know what's in it ?\n\t\t\t(another sip)\n\t\tAn Ingram Machine pistol.\n\n\tGradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a\n\tNEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :\n\n\t\tCHARLIE\t\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\tI don't tahe chances, and\t\t\tBullshit. You can kill\n\tneither should this country.\t\t\twith the ridge of your\n\tIf we're strong, we should\t\t\thand to the throat; you\n\tprotect our interests, and\t\t\tcan crush a skull with\n\twe should have the respect\t\t\tyour knee... but you\n\tof the world, even if it\t\t\t\tcan't kill anybody with\n\ttakes another war.\t\t\t\tyour pinky.\n\n\tThe VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :\n\tPictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the\n\tgood life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\tThe attache case has been empty\n\t\tfor three years, but it makes him\n\t\tsafe to think there's a machine\n\t\tpistol in it.\n\n\t\tI don't like automatic weapons.\n\t\tThey jam.\n\n\t\tI saw a friend of mine get\n\t\tripped open because he flicked his\n\t\tM-16 to automatic, and it jammed.\n\t\tHow much money did the contractors\n\t\tmake on the M-16 ?\n\n\tOur VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some\n\treading, flirting, drinking.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHe likes to hear stories about Nam.\n\t\tI tell him I can't; they're not\n\t\tcleared. The truth is he wouldn't\n\t\tunderstand.\n\n\tWe can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the\n\topposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We \n\tMOVE CLOSER.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThere's no way I can tell them...\n\t\twhat really happened over there.\n\n\t\tI wouldn't've believed it if\n\t\tsomeone'd told me.\n\n\tWe are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips\n\tfrom a beer, but we cannot see his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThere was only one part that\n\t\tmattered -- for me, anyway. I\n\t\tdon't even know if I remember\n\t\tall of it. I can't remember\n\t\thow it ended, exactly -- because\n\t\twhen it ended I was insane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO :\n\n\t4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY\n\n\tA Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and\n\tshops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.\n\tOur VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.\n\tWILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed\n\tby four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his\n\tshoes and sell him things.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\tBut I know how it started\n\t\tfor me -- I was on R. and R.\n\t\tin Saigon; my first time south\n\t\tof the DMZ in three months. I\n\t\twasn't sure, but I thought this\n\t\tguy was following me.\n\n\tWillard looks back.\n\n\n\t5  HIS VIEW\n\n\tan American CIVILIAN.\n\n\n\t6  MED. VIEW\n\n\tWillard ducks into a bar.\n\n\n\t7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY\n\n\tNot much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few\n\ttables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly\n\tcrowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly\n\tpast the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching\n\tsight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.\n\n\tAn INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of\n\tdrinks and approaches Willard's table.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tHow about a drink ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tSure, thanks.\n\n\tHe sits down at the table with the drinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tWinning the war by yourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\t\t(he calls for the waiter)\n\t\tPart.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tWhich part is that ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tMy part.\n\t\t\t(TO THE WAITER)\n\t\tBeer, with ice and water.\n\n\t   \n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tThat's good gin.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tDelta ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tNorth ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tYeah. Way north.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tWhat unit were you with ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tNone.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tRangers, eh?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tSort of.\n\n\tThe JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over\n\this shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tWere you Longe Range Recon --\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tNo -- I worked too far north for\n\t\tLRRP.\n\n\tHe reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the\n\tCaptain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard\n\tnotices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,\n\tthen enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tThat's quite an array of ribbons...\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tLet's talk about you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tI was an FO for the 25th.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tTracks ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tFat. That's real fat.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tSometimes.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tAt least you always have enough\n\t\twater. How many gallons does\n\t\teach one of those damn things\n\t\tcarry ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tThirty -- sometimes fifty.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tYou know, I can remember once,\n\t\tgetting back below the DMZ -- and\n\t\tthe first Americans we ran into\n\t\twere a track squadron. I just\n\t\tcouldn't believe how much water\n\t\tthey had. We'd been chewing\n\t\tbamboo shoots for almost a week,\n\t\tand before that, for two weeks,\n\t\twe'd been drinking anything --\n\t\train water, river shit, stuff\n\t\tright out of the paddies. And\n\t\tthere were these guys standing\n\t\tby their trucks spilling water\n\t\tall over. I could've killed them.\n\t\t\t(solemnly)\n\t\tI swear to God I would have, too,\n\t\tif ...\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tI didn't know we had units up\n\t\tthere in North Vietnam.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tWe do.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tHow long were you up there ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tA long time.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tA year ? Waiter another beer.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI go up on missions. Listen\n\t\tCaptain, buy me all the beer\n\t\tyou want, but you better tell\n\t\tthat asshole over there you're\n\t\tnot going to find out anymore\n\t\tabout me.\n\n\tWillard glances over his shoulder and indicates the\n\tCivilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.\n\tHe rises and comes over to the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat do you want ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCIVILIAN\n\t\t\t(indicating the Army jeep)\n\t\tIf you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon\n\t\tGroup, we'd like you to come with\n\t\tus.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tWhose orders ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\tHeadquarters 11 Corps -- 405th\n\t\tA.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --\n\t\tCom-Sec -- Intelligence --\n\t\tNha Trang.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tWho are you ?\n\n\t\t\t\tCIVILIAN\n\t\tThe agency.\n\n\tWillard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks\n\troght out toward the jeep without saying another word.\n\tThe Civilian follows.\n\n\n\t8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK\n\n\tA darkly painted \"HUEY\" ROARS over low paddies and jungle\n\tbefore emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed\n\twire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily\n\tfortified, concealed compound.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD (V.O.)\n\t\tThey took me to some place outside\n\t\tNha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters\n\t\tfor all operations in South East Asia.\n\t\tI'd worked for Intelligence before --\n\n\tArmed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A\n\tlarge camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground\n\tcorridor -- they enter.\n\n\n\t9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM\n\n\tA door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to\n\tattention, blocking the view of the room. A strange\n\treddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic\n\tmaps and filled with smoke.\n\n\tThe whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself\n\tand there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly\n\treclaiming it.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tCaptain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,\n\t\treporting as ordered, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL (O.S.)\n\t\tOkay, Willard, sit down.\n\n\tWillard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a\n\tbare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks\n\tand tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL\n\tputs his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind\n\thim sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tHave you ever seen this officer\n\t\tbefore, Captain Willard ?\n\n\tHe points to the Major.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tNo, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tThis gentleman or myself ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tNo, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tI believe on your last job you\n\t\texecuted a tax collector in Kontum,\n\t\tis that right ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI am not presently disposed to\n\t\tdiscuss that, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAJOR\n\t\tVery good.\n\n\tHe turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The\n\tColonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tYou know much about about Special Forces;\n\t\tGreen Berets, Captain ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI've worked with them on occasions\n\t\tand I saw the movie , sir.\n\n\tThe officer smiles at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tThen you can appreciate Command's\n\t\tconcern over their -- shall we say\n\t\t'erratic' methods of operation.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI have never favored elite units,\n\t\tCaptain, including your paratroopers\n\t\tor whatever. Just because a man\n\t\tjumps out of an airplane or wears\n\t\ta silly hat doesn't give him any\n\t\tpriviliges in my book -- not in\n\t\tthis man's army.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAJOR\n\t\tWe didn't need 'em in Korea --\n\t\tno sir, give me an Ohio farm boy\n\t\tand an M-1 Garand, none of this\n\t\tfancy crap -- no sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tCIVILIAN\n\t\t\t(stopping him)\n\t\tMajor.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tWe have Special Forces A\n\t\tdetachments all along the\n\t\tCambodian border. Two here and\n\t\tanother one here -- twelve or\n\t\tfourteen Americans -- pretty\n\t\tmuch on their own; they train\n\t\tand motivate Montagnard natives;\n\t\tpick their own operations. If\n\t\tthey need something, they call \n\t\tfor it, and get it within\n\t\treason. What we're concerned\n\t\twith is here.\n\n\n\t10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tThe A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.\n\t\tIt was originally a larger base,\n\t\tbuilt up along the river in an\n\t\told Cambodian fortress.\n\t\n\t\tThe area has been relatively\n\t\tquiet for the past two years --\n\t\tbut --\n\n\n\t11  MED VIEW\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\t... Captain, we know something's\n\t\tgoing on up there -- Major --\n\n\tThe Major looks at some papers in front of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAJOR\n\t\tCommunications naturally dwindled\n\t\twith the lack of V.C. activity,\n\t\tthis is routine, expected ... but\n\t\tsix months ago communication\n\t\tvirtually stopped.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\tAbout the same time -- large numbers\n\t\tof Montagnards of the M'Nong descent\n\t\tbegan leaving the area -- this in\n\t\titself is not unusual since these\n\t\tpeople have fought with the Rhade\n\t\tTribe that lived in the area for\n\t\tcenturies. But what is unusual is\n\t\tthat we began to find Rhade refugees\n\t\ttoo -- in the same sampans as the\n\t\tM'Nongs. These people aren't afraid\n\t\tof V.C. They've put up with war\n\t\tfor twenty years -- but something\n\t\tis driving them out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAJOR\n\t\tWe communicate with the base\n\t\tinfrequently.

The men are practically\n\tin a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They\n\tdon\u00b4t even make an effort to touch their weapons.\n\n\n\t214  WHAT THEY SEE\n\n\tHundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed\n\tin the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts\n\tof birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face\n\tpaint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity\n\tabout them, men and boys, standing passively watching\n\tthe small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,\n\twhite and blue.\n\n\n\t215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.\n\n\tThe men of the crew are not the same men who began this\n\tvoyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.\n\tThe various decorations and paraphenelia that they have\n\tpicked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the\n\tsavages that stand before them. The Chef has made a\n\that of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with\n\tmud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He\n\twears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.\n\tTheir uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the\n\tdifficult journey. They start to move to their gun\n\tpositions.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tJust stand here with me where\n\t\tthey can see us. Do nothing.\n\n\n\t216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.\n\n\tMOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers\n\tand war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The\n\tmen on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly\n\twithout weapons. The natives standing across the river\n\tmake no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept\n\tthe small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-\n\ttability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of\n\tfeathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in\n\talmost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little\n\tboat to penetrate.\n\n\n\t217  VIEW ON WILLARD\n\n\tMus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms\n\tof some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks\n\tsomething like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition\n\twas right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.\n\n\n\t218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER\n\n\tHundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river\n\tnow run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping\n\tpace with the P.B.R.

The P.B.R. moves towards the\n\twater's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina\n\twire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding\n\tthem safely in.\n\n\tA thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the\n\tfort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near\n\tthe dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-\n\tmerged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some\n\tof them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the\n\tground. Chef nods at the bodies.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHEF\n\t\tCharlie?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tLooks that way.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHEF\n\t\t\t(looking at the Australian)\n\t\tWho's he?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tGod knows.\n\n\tThe boat pulls up.

They wear only loinclothes\n\tand bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted\n\tin strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian\n\tAK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women\n\temerge from the brush as well. they are armed and\n\tequally primitive looking. Interspersed among them\n\tare a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants\n\tof Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,\n\tif anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS\n\tthe entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,\n\twhere thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against\n\tthe sky. Willard and his men look up at people more\n\tprimitive and more savage than any since the time\n\tof Captain Cook.\n\n\tThey encounter, in the center of the group, what once\n\tappears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,\n\twears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a\n\tloincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,\n\tstrange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are\n\tlong, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47\n\tdecorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches\n\tthis beast, who seems shy and retiring.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tWho are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tMOONBY\n\t\t\t(breaking in)\n\t\tHis name is...\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI'm not ever goin' to tell you\n\t\tto shut up again.\n\n\tMoonby shuts up.

He takes his arm.\n\n\n\t229  REVERSE ON COLBY\n\n\tlooks at Willard, not understanding.\n\n\n\t230  REVERSE ON WILLARD\n\n\tSix months later, and he and Colby would be identical.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI'm taking you back.\n\n\tMoonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOONBY\n\t\tOh, no, don\u00b4t say that.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLBY\n\t\tTake us back.

You'll see --\n\t\tthe genius of our Colonel. He\n\t\tshould be made a General, don't\n\t\tyou think? A General? It's...\n\n\tSuddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard\n\tknows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.\n\n\tKurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is\n\ta powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly\n\tattempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,\n\tthough it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with\n\tprimitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as\n\twell as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,\n\twith long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes\n\talmost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what\n\tseems to be a serious wound.\n\n\n\t232  VIEW ON WILLARD\n\n\tThis is not what he expected.

As the boat moves, Montagnards, those\n\tleft alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.\n\tColby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.\n\tSome of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.\n\tThe battle is not over.\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n\t\tDon't. Don't frighten them away.\n\n\tWillard looks down at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tSo you understand this?\n\n\tKurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his\n\teyes. There is a slight smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n\t\tDo I not?\n\n\n\t282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW\n\n\tThe boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n\t\tMy river... my people... my jungle...\n\t\tmy ideas... my country... \t\t\n\t\tmy wife...\n\t\t\t(he looks at Willard)\n\t\t... my death.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tYou had immense plans... immense plans...\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n\t\tYes...\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI'm taking you back.\n\n\tKurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming\n\tintense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper\n\tat some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry\n\tthat is no more than a breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ\n\t\tThe horror, the horror.\n\n\tWe HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.\n\tThe SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,\n\tcraning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLBY\n\t\tThere.\n\n\tOver the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC\n\thelicopters hooping toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLBY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHow did they know?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tThey must have seen the fire.\n\n\tThe helicopters are closer now but high up.

Willard is very silent.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tI never answered questions about\n\t\tKurtz -- I gave them a few of his\n\t\tunimportant papers -- but for the\n\t\tmost part I saved everything.\n\t\tThere were other letters, personal\n\t\tones written earlier to his wife.\n\t\tI brought them to het. I watched\n\t\tthe fall of Saigon on television\n\t\tin a bar in Alameda...\n\n\n\t289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\n\tA bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-\n\tborhood. Some kids are playing in the street.\n\n\tWillard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past\n\tthe lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under\n\this arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working\n\ton a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy\n\tlooks back.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLARD\n\t\tHi.\n\n\tThen the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the\n\tdoor. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in\n\tmourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a\n\tsense of purity about her, though she is not young.\n\n\t\t\t\tKURTZ'S WIFE\n\t\tCome in, Captain Willard.\n\n\tHe enters.\n\n\n\t289  INT.
