Above this din one particular victim yells\n     for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage.\n\n     By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by\n     the surrounding tumult, until without warning his\n     voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time\n     reduced to naked scream.\n\n     And with the sound, an image.\n\n     A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three\n     storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining\n     its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there\n     is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin\n     to run, as we approach the house down the driveway.\n\n     We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are\n     louder now.\n\n     Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the\n     titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for\n     many years, though much of its furniture remains,\n     covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room,\n     a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life\n     here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a\n     glass.\n\n     We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the\n     lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the\n     floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn;\n     an open suitcase; more liquor.\n\n     We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper\n     landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light\n     within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into\n     the passageway.\n\n     As we reach the door, the screams from within halt\n     abruptly.\n\n     We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing\n     steadily throughout this opening sequence.\n\n     As we move through the door, the titles end.\n\n\n<b>2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently,\n     disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them -\n     disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all\n     are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with\n     pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated,\n     others simply drip blood.\n\n     The bell tolls on.\n\n     On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches\n     square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle\n     box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function.\n     It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a\n     way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains\n     an enigma.\n\n     A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles,\n     reaches down and picks the box up.\n\n     In close up we see just what an elaborate construction\n     it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious\n     chambers.  It is open at present, its polished\n     innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played\n     on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to\n     one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.\n\n<b>                             CENOBITE\n</b>                       (unseen)\n                It's over ...\n\n     Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box,\n     sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the\n     tune simplifying with each manoeuvre.\n\n     The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing\n     into the gloom.\n\n     We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning\n     from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch\n     sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest\n     of moments.  Then they're gone.\n\n     The box is almost returned to its unopened condition.\n\n     The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box,\n     and the bell.\n\n     It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid\n     into place.\n\n     The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune\n     stops.\n\n     At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the\n     window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is\n     dust settling through the air.\n\n     Otherwise it is empty.\n\n     The bell fades.\n\n     It's as if nothing ever happened here.\n\n     Except ...\n\n     Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be\n     the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp\n     of a thing barely alive.\n\n\n<b>3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY\n</b>\n     The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number\n     55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of\n     LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly\n     LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the\n     sound of keys tried in the lock.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                It's one of these.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                We're going to freeze to death.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b><b>                0.K.  0.K.\n</b>\n     The sound of another key tried in the lock.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Maybe somebody changed the lock.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (slightly irritated)\n                Like who?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Just a thought -\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Ah!\n\n     The key is turned.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Success.\n\n     The door swings open.\n\n                Voila!\n\n     We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American\n     in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost\n     his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks\n     too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him\n     is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English:\n     and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is\n     beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried\n     unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of\n     late: and LARRY has been a major part of their\n     disappointment.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Well.  This is it.\n\n     They step over the threshold.\n\n\n<b>4    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n</b>\n     The door of the Torture Room creaks, as the wind blows\n     it opens an inch.  From downstairs, we hear JULIA's\n     voice.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                It smells damp.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                It's just been empty a while.\n\n\n<b>5    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n</b>\n    LARRY slams the front door.\n\n\n<b>6    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n</b>\n     The Torture Room door creaks closed again.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (from below)\n                Besides, it's an old house.\n\n\n<b>7    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n</b>\n     He stands in the hallway, not certain which way to\n     go from here.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                How long since you were here?\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                The best part of ten years.\n\n     LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from\n     behind the door, then leads JULIA through from the\n     hallway to explore the ground floor.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                I wanted to sell it off at\n                one point, after the old Lady\n                died, but I couldn't get Frank\n                to agree.\n\n     He opens one of the doors, and looks inside.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (with pleasure)\n                Christ.  It's not been touched.\n\n     He continues along the passageway.  He opens another\n     door, and steps into a large room.  He opens one of\n     the curtains.  Light pours in, dust-laden shafts falling\n     on the sheeted furniture.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Look at this.\n\n     JULIA lingers in the doorway.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Why didn't he want to sell it?\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (dismissively)\n                I don't know. Probably wanted\n                a hideaway.\n\n     He pulls a sheet off a chair.\n\n                Look at this stuff.\n\n     The chair is ugly; old fashioned.  JULIA is unimpressed.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Not exactly modern.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (shrugs)\n                We'll sell it.  Sell everything.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                I thought half of it was your\n                brother's?\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                He won't complain.  He can pay\n                off some of his creditors.\n\n     LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by\n     the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA\n     to explore further.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                You know we have to let Kirsty\n                see this place, before we do\n                anything to it.  She'll love it.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                You mean we're moving in?\n\n     LARRY pauses.  Looks at her.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                You don't like it?\n\n     JULIA shrugs.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                It's better than Brooklyn.\n\n     She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then\n     follows.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                You're still blaming me.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                No.  I'm not.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                You wanted to come back to\n                London.  We came back.\n\n     We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens\n     of times, which immediately annoys them both.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                All right.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                So what's the argument?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                       (cold)\n                No argument.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Oh Christ.  Julia ...\n\n     JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then\n     starts to climb.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (exasperated, to\n                        himself)\n                Shit.\n\n\n<b>8    INT.   LANDING   DAY\n</b>\n     JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed\n     feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses\n     her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them\n     is stale, like this house.\n\n\n<b>9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n</b>\n     The door opens a fraction.\n\n\n<b>10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY\n</b>\n     LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains\n     of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence,\n     now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the\n     expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then,\n     from above:\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Larry!\n\n     He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the\n     bottom of the stairs.\n\n                Larry!\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                I hear you.\n\n     He starts up the stairs.\n\n\n<b>11   INT.

Beyond, the 'bedroom'\n     we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Squatters?\n\n     LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets.\n     Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and\n     starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a\n     lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked\n     up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets;\n     Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from\n     a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs.\n     LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking\n     intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed\n     with a naked Chinese girl.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Frank.\n\n     At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                He's here?\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                He's been here.  There's stuff\n                in the kitchen.  He must have\n                made a hasty exit.\n\n     The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps.\n\n                That'll be Kirsty.\n\n     LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA\n     in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the\n     bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings.\n     As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's\n     face is close to tears.\n\n\n<b>12   INT.

LARRY steps through\n     and picks up the receiver.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Hello ...?\n\n     There's no answer.\n\n                Hello ...?\n\n\n<b>13   INT.

FRANK'S BEDROOM    DAY\n</b>\n     Mission accomplished, JULIA leaves the bedroom, taking\n     one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the\n     indented pillar where Frank lay.  A lone wood-louse\n     crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds.  She\n     closes the door on the sight.  Downstairs, the\n     'phone stops ringing.\n\n\n<b>18   INT.

She is barely twenty,\n     beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl-\n     next-door.  We can't see much of the room she's in at\n     the moment, the shot is too tight.\n\n<b>                             LARRY   (V.0.)\n</b>                Kirsty?\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                I got through.\n\n<b>                             LARRY   (V.O.)\n</b>                Where are you?\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                I found a room.\n\n\n<b>20   INT.

The room she's in is cramped and dirty.\n     From outside, the sound of trains going by.\n\n<b>                             LARRY (V.0.)\n</b>                I thought you were going to\n                stay with us for awhile?\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                       (pained)\n                No Dad.\n\n<b>                             LARRY (V.0.)\n</b>                You'd like the house.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                YOU'D like my room.\n\n<b>                             LARRY (V.0.)\n</b>                Do you want me to come over?\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                       (hastily)\n                No, no.

The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning\n     of the gesture perfectly apparent.  JULIA heads\n     upstairs.\n\n\n<b>25   EXT.

Something about the\n     atmosphere distresses her.\n\n     There is a scratching sound.  She looks down.  A\n     wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls\n     along the edge of the skirting board.  She crosses\n     to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole\n     in the aged newspaper.\n\n     From downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers.\n\n<b>                             1ST MAN\n</b>                Have you got it?\n\n<b>                             2ND MAN\n</b>                I've got it.

JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n</b>\n     A bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between\n     the slats of bamboo blinds.  Outside we can hear\n     children playing summer games.  Inside, a fly buzzes.\n\n     JULIA, the younger self, is holding her wedding\n     dress in front of her, displaying it.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Well?\n\n<b>                             FRANK (0.S.)\n</b>                I don't want to see the dress.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                But you said -\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                I don't want to see the dress.\n\n     JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front\n     of her.  She stares at FRANK.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                You know what I want.\n\n     Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress\n     offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall.\n     She stares though, and there's an invitation in her\n     eyes.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                I want you.\n\n     Now we\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO\n</b>\n     FRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene,\n     but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat\n     to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost\n     dangerous.\n\n     Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the\n     bed behind her.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                That's better\n\n     FRANK steps towards her.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                What about Larry -\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Forget him.\n\n     FRANK takes hold of her.

JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n</b>\n     The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now.\n     Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their\n     weight.\n\n     Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is\n     an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK\n     licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold\n     on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence\n     escalates into a series of strange details from\n     their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms;\n     sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And\n     once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching\n     FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity;\n     FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the\n     experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered\n     stranger still by the way the light through the window\n     falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them.\n\n     At last, as their urgency increases, we move up\n     until we're looking directly down on the bed.\n     From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the\n     ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms\n     are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed\n     as she murmurs:\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Oh my God.  Oh my God.

He cries\n     out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish,\n     drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from\n     the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Christ!\n\n<b>                             1ST MAN\n</b>                What's the problem?\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                My fucking hand!\n\n     He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand\n     from the nail upon which he's injured himself.

He hates the sight of his own blood.\n     Any moment, he may faint.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                ... Oh Christ ...\n\n     But not in front of these bastards.  He turns and\n     starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                ... oh ... Christ ...\n\n\n<b>46   INT.

As we watch,\n     it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the\n     room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not\n     quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless,\n     and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ...\n\n\n<b>51   INT.

She looks utterly miserable, and a little\n     drunk.\n\n     The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles\n     are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are\n     pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially\n     cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re-\n     decorated.\n\n     We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize:\n     KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining\n     the gathering with an account of his accident.  The\n     others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL\n     UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with\n     LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work\n     colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk.\n     A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and\n     half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE,\n     it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY.\n\n     LARRY is half-way through his hospital story,\n     gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale,\n     much to the pleasure of the rest.

PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY\n</b>\n     The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables\n     full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the\n     melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things\n     at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody\n     else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining.\n     She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She\n     serves a table with their food, and then starts back\n     to pick up another order.   As she does so she's\n     harangued from every side.\n\n<b>                             1ST CUSTOMER\n</b>                Excuse me, Miss -\n\n<b>                             2ND CUSTOMER\n</b>                I'd like some more lager.\n\n<b>                             1ST CUSTOMER\n</b>                Miss!\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                In a moment.\n\n<b>                             2ND CUSTOMER\n</b>                Did you hear me?\n\n     KIRSTY starts back to the counter.

BAR    DAY\n</b>\n     By contrast, a quiet bar.   Discreet music;  a well-dressed\n     clientele.  Several couples occupy booths.  Other solitary\n     drinkers are at the bar.\n\n     Amongst them:   JULIA.\n\n     Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some\n     considerable effort to make herself ravishing.  There's\n     nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation\n     which shows off her considerable beauty.  She drinks soda\n     water.\n\n     She has an admirer.   Sitting alone at one of the tables\n     is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous,\n     slightly paunchy individual.  She glances over at him. His\n     eyes don't leave her for a moment.  He's trying his best\n     to get the courage to approach her.\n\n     She looks away, and concentrates on her drink.  Now she\n     takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. Her hands are\n     trembling slightly.  She lights the cigarette, draws on\n     it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that\n     she's not the equal of it.  She stubs the cigarette out,\n     puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave.\n\n     Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                Not much fun, is it?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                What?\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                Drinking alone.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Not much.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                I wonder, maybe ...\n\n     He's so nervous he can barely speak.\n\n                ... as we're both on our own ...\n                we could have one drink together?\n\n     JULIA looks at him.  He seems to almost be offering\n     himself to her.   There's a long pause, while she tries\n     to make up her mind. Then:\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Why not?\n\n     She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves\n     diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that\n     she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of\n     cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                       (to Julia)\n                What are you drinking?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Just soda.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                Plain soda?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Please.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                I try not to drink at lunch-\n                time.

Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he\n     - scarcely believing his luck - returns.\n\n\n<b>69   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n</b>\n     The CAMERA moves across the room. We can hear FRANK's\n     ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor\n     beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its\n     sides gleaming.  FRANK, still squatting on the floor,\n     taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers.\n\n     Then, voices outside:  JULIA laughs.\n\n     He raises his head.\n\n\n<b>70   EXT.

He kisses her.

We can hear her pulse on\n     the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He\n     follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the\n     cheek.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                       (takes over his\n                       undressing)\n                Why don't you do the same?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Maybe I will.\n\n     PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying\n     not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant.\n\n     We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear.\n     He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton.\n     We move back into a tighter shot.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                       (voice slightly slurred)\n                You know, you're very beautiful.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Am I?\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                You know you are.

To avoid the following blow he stumbles\n     blindly towards the wall but JULIA's not going to be\n     stopped now.  He holds the back of his head - dazed,\n     apologetic, pitiful - while she moves towards him.\n\n<b>                             PRUDHOE\n</b>                Don't ...

I don't understand ...\n\n     She strikes him.  He slides down the wall, his jaw\n     broken, blood pouring from his face.   He twitches.  Then\n     the twitches stop.\n\n     She drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Enough?\n\n     The room sighs.

She is trembling from head to\n     foot.\n\n     Stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side\n     of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with\n     cold water.  Then she stares up at her face again,\n     examining it.  She can scarcely believe what she's done.\n\n\n<b>75   INT.

We are\n     granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than\n     before, but still horribly vulnerable.\n\n     JULIA looks at PRUDHOE's corpse.  A trail of blood leads\n     away from it into the darkness.

They kept to their\n                bargain.  They gave me\n                experiences I'd never forget ...\n\n     The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and\n     they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running\n     across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                But their pleasure was my pain.\n\n     His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the\n     box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing\n     between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's\n     faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Terrible pain.  Appalling ...\n\n     He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes\n     on, his voice heavy.\n\n                My body was forfeit.  But my\n                spirit ... they left that here.\n                In the boards.  In the walls.\n                Watching the world, but never\n                able to touch it ...\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                And the blood let you out?\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                There are ways to resurrection.\n                Blood's one of them.  I won't\n                let them take me back, Julia.\n\n     JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands\n     his desire.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                I want to be whole, and then\n                get out -\n\n     He lifts the box up.\n\n                I won't let them take me.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                You won't have to.  We'll be\n                gone.  Somewhere they'll\n                never find us.\n\n     There's a rumble of thunder.\n\n                Not in the whole wide world.\n\n\n<b>102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the\n     windows.\n\n     The television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on\n     the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He\n     has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside\n     his feet; and there's another in his hand.\n\n     JULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen\n     to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is\n     starting to flow.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Is this upsetting you?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                I've seen worse.\n\n     LARRY looks at her.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Are you all right?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Fine.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Only I'll turn it off -\n\n     There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen,\n     as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY\n     turns his attention back to the match.\n\n<b>                             COMMENTATOR\n</b>                And he's down!  He's down!\n\n     The thunder rolls on.\n\n\n<b>103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     The lightning finds its way through the holes in\n     the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window,\n     his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand,\n     on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's\n     tapped out before.  He turns away from the window,\n     and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the\n     floor.\n\n\n<b>104  INT.

UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n</b>\n     In such tight close up we can't sec that FRANK has\n     in fact left the Torture Room, we see his features\n     register that somebody is coming.\n\n\n<b>106  INT.

JULIA follows.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                It was nothing.\n\n     LARRY has reached the top of the stairs.  He looks up\n     the next flight.\n\n                Larry ...\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                What's wrong with you?\n\n     She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture\n     Room.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                I just hate the thunder.\n\n     He crosses to her.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                I'm here.\n\n     He puts his arms around her.  She responds.\n\n                You're shaking.\n\n     He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly. The thunder\n     shakes the house.\n\n                There's nothing to be afraid\n                of.\n\n     He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her.\n\n                I'll just go check upstairs ...\n\n     He kisses her again.  She, in order to distract him,\n     kisses him back.  Her passion is artificial, but he\n     doesn't register that.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Oh baby.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Don't go upstairs.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Come with me then.\n\n     He starts up the stairs.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Please ...\n\n\n<b>107  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n</b>\n     He reaches the top of the stairs.  First he throws\n     open the Junk Room.  Lightning flashes on boxes\n     inside.  Then he moves towards the Torture Room.\n     The thunder rolls more loudly.\n\n     She follows him along the landing, desperate to stop\n     him.\n\n     Too late.  He throws open the door.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Don't.\n\n     Lightning floods the room.  It's empty.

Where's FRANK gone?\n     LARRY turns to her, holding her again, on the\n     threshold of the Torture Room.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                See?  Quite safe.\n\n     He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss.\n\n                Let's go  down.  I'll make it\n                better.\n\n     He kisses her again.\n\n\n<b>108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     A shadow moves across the screen as the door opens,\n     and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's\n     hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed,\n     illuminated by the light from the landing, and the\n     occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels\n     between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes\n     closed.\n\n     JULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She\n     senses FRANK's presence.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                ... oh babe ...\n\n     He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted\n     by her suspicions; he has his hands against her\n     almost before she realizes what's happening.\n\n     We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The\n     dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the\n     window.  Does something move in the shadows?\n\n     A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing.\n\n     LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him,\n     kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly\n     dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK,\n     but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is\n     so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he\n     doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is\n     elsewhere.\n\n     Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of\n     the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder\n     and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we\n     can barely make out.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                ...I love you, honey ... let\n                me ... oh God ... I love you ...\n\n     Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a\n     tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace\n     of eroticism from the scene.\n\n     A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows\n     just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes\n     closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's\n     body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK\n     is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious\n     to all of this, of course.\n\n     We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making.\n     Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan\n     of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                Oh baby ... I love you ...\n\n     From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble\n     towards the lovers.\n\n     From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed,\n     LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what\n     he intends.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                ... no ...\n\n     LARRY barely hears her.\n\n     FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA\n     becomes highly agitated.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE.\n                No.\n\n     LARRY stops his love-making.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                       (looks at her)\n                Huh?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Please ...\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                What's wrong with you?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                       (almost sobbing)\n                Please.  I can't bear it ...\n\n     LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He\n     disengages his arms from around her.\n\n     JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats.\n\n     LARRY rolls off JULIA.\n\n     The wardrobe door closes.  Click.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                I don't understand you.  One\n                moment you're all over me, the\n                next it's:  Don't touch me.\n\n     He sits on the edge of the bed.\n\n                I just don't understand.\n\n     He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where\n     she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it,\n     from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the\n     wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK\n     stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his\n     face; his skeletal grin.\n\n     Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof,\n     we hear laughter.\n\n\n<b>109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING\n</b>\n     KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together,\n     in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite,\n     to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept\n     for several nights.

She wants to be delicate with her father's\n     feelings, but honest at the same time.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                I don't know her.

She falls, heavily.\n\n     Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her.\n\n     On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a\n     poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes\n     after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow\n     to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for\n     the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her.\n     She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now.\n     Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more.\n\n     She raises the box to retaliate.

Distant,\n     incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood\n     in the inner ear.\n\n     Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like\n     Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as\n     sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness,\n     soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet\n     in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous\n     dialogue.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Come to Daddy.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                This isn't happening.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Some things have to be endured ...\n\n     The darkness is filling the screen\n\n                ... take it from me ...\n\n     Now, total darkness.\n\n                ...

JULIA comes down the stairs.\n     She looks pale; even ill.\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                What's wrong?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                I don't know where to begin ...\n\n<b>                             LARRY\n</b>                What are you talking about?\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                It's better you see for your-\n                self -\n\n     She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows.\n\n\n<b>146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     KIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more\n     complex now.\n\n     Somewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works\n     the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light\n     flickers and goes out.\n\n     The bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She\n     drops it, shocked.\n\n     The bedside light comes on again.\n\n     She looks up.\n\n     In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow\n     doorway has simply opened in the wall.\n\n     Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to\n     the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant,\n     rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway.\n\n\n<b>147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT\n</b>\n     We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against\n     a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor.\n\n\n<b>148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     The sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor -\n     which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely\n     dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down\n     it or not.\n\n     She glances towards the door of her room, from the other\n     side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital\n     going about its business.  What's to fear?\n\n\n<b>149  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT\n</b>\n     She steps into the corridor.    The walls rise into\n     darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like\n     the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and\n     rotting away.\n\n     She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on\n     the impacted earth of the passageway.\n\n     The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form\n     disappearing entirely as she passes through the\n     intermittent darkness.\n\n     Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to\n     reassure herself that it's still there.  It is,\n     though it's no more than a sliver of light at the\n     far end of the passageway.\n\n     She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is\n     growing denser; smoke thickens the air.\n\n     Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor.\n\n     The sound of the sobbing child ceases.\n\n     She stops walking.\n\n     Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we\n     see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space\n     between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the\n     light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles\n     no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it\n     suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone.\n     Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down\n     from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over\n     its back.\n\n     KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER\n     moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits.\n     From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom,\n     glides into view.\n\n     And then -\n\n     - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by\n     bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a\n     growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when\n     all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it\n     finds the light.\n\n     KIRSTY turns, and starts to run.\n\n     It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness,\n     light; roars and silence -\n\n     Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam.\n\n     KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the\n     safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her\n     heels, lingering -\n\n     As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes\n     on her.\n\n\n<b>150  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n</b>\n     She flings herself through the door with THE ENGINEER's\n     breath on her back, and turns -\n\n     The doorway has gone.  The wall is sealed.  She approaches\n     the wall.   THE ENGINEER scratches on the other side ...\n\n     Then, she realises that the bell is still ringing.  And\n     there's a foul smell in the air.\n\n     She looks around.\n\n     She's not alone.\n\n     Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange\n     phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four\n     extraordinary figures.\n\n     They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated\n     by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear\n     are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh,\n     laced through skin in places, hooked into bone.\n\n     The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head\n     at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is\n     pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying\n     them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping\n     rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and\n     a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark\n     glasses.\n\n     When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as\n     that of the creature from the beginning of the film.\n\n     KIRSTY stares in amazement.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Where the hell did you come from?\n\n     The CENOBITE gestures.  The box is lying on the bed.\n\n<b>                             CENOBITE\n</b>                The box ... you opened it.\n                We came.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                It's just a puzzle box.\n\n<b>                             CENOBITE\n</b>                It's a means to summon us -\n                it's called the Lament Con-\n                figuration.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Who are you?\n\n<b>                             CENOBITE\n</b>                Cenobites.

STEVE's hand moves to the\n     place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE\n     takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes\n     beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook.\n     STEVE winces.\n\n<b>                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n</b>                If he takes another step, we\n                open his throat.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                       (to Steve)\n                Please go, Steve.\n\n<b>                             STEVE\n</b>                What?\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Just go.

The bells and the thunder\n     fill the soundtrack.\n\n     LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have\n     begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His\n     smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails\n     rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the\n     brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears\n     slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into\n     view.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Frank!\n\n     KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in\n     the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out.\n\n     KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him\n     to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped.\n     His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior\n     of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the\n     lining.\n\n     Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair.\n\n     FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before\n     the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA\n     shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as\n     it's buried to the hilt in her side.\n\n     KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into\n     FRANK's arms.   He holds her up.\n\n     KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets\n     JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back\n     against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom\n     of the stairs.  FRANK follows.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                You're not leaving now -\n\n     As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his\n     sleeve.\n\n     KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The\n     house is creaking in every board and rafter now.\n\n     FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall.,\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Help me, Frank. For God's\n                sake.\n\n     He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards\n     her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that\n     he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little\n     life she has left.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                No, Frank -\n\n     From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon\n     her.\n\n     Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs.\n\n     When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms.\n\n\n<b>170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT\n</b>\n     The landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a\n     yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans.\n\n     KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one\n     of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and\n     the din of birds' wings gets louder.\n\n\n<b>171  INT.

FRANK stands\n     on the theshold.   His breath is thick.  He shambles\n     forward, but he doesn't see her.\n\n     We CUT back to the shadows.  KIRSTY's eyes are wild\n     with terror.\n\n     Back to the door, which clicks closed.\n\n     KIRSTY breaks cover, and so does her saviour.  It's\n     STEVE.  He is sweating with terror.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                       (a whisper)\n                What are you doing here?\n\n<b>                             STEVE\n</b>                Got in downstairs.

They plough through his flesh as\n     he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader\n     of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings\n     back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.\n\n<b>                             CENOBITE\n</b>                       (to Kirsty)\n                Out!\n\n     She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled\n     back towards the centre of the room.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Bitch!\n\n     The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as\n     KIRSTY steps onto the landing.\n\n\n<b>180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT\n</b>\n     Behind her, FRANK howls.\n\n     She looks back.\n\n     They have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled;\n     hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He\n     fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They\n     pull the chains tighter.\n\n\n<b>181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT\n</b>\n     A close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting.\n     He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from\n     beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his\n     tongue over his bloodied lips.\n\n     Then -\n\n     - he comes apart.\n\n\n<b>182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT\n</b>\n     The door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter\n     of blood and flesh fragments.\n\n     Something heavy thuds against the door.\n\n     KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs.\n\n\n<b>183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT\n</b>\n     As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half-\n     lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations\n     are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and\n     his face is bruised, but he's conscious.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                We have to get out of here.\n                They'll kill us for the fun of\n                it.\n\n     STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box,\n     which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up,\n     the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows.\n\n<b>                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n</b>                Don't leave us yet -\n\n     KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands.\n\n<b>                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n</b>                We've got such sights to show\n                you -\n\n     KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back\n     into place.\n\n<b>                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n</b>                ... don't ...\n\n     Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into\n     darkness.\n\n<b>                             STEVE\n</b>                       (behind Kirsty)\n                Jesus Christ.\n\n     They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the\n     CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod\n     he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again,\n     KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls\n     and is claimed by the darkness.\n\n\n<b>184  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT\n</b>\n     They hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another\n     creature to step into their path.  Dust is falling from\n     the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up  in the\n     walls.  Any moment, surely, the whole place will be\n     destroyed.\n\n     JULIA's body has gone from the hallway;  a trail of blood\n     leads into the dining room.\n\n     As KIRSTY and STEVE stumble across the hallway, they hear\n     JULIA's voice, off-screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.\n\n<b>                             JULIA\n</b>                Kirsty ...\n\n     KIRSTY hesitates, and looks towards the door of the\n     dining room.\n\n     There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood,\n     her veil covering her face.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Julia?\n\n     KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the\n     veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE\n     is beneath.\n\n     KIRSTY slams the box closed.\n\n     The CENOBITE howls, and disappears.\n\n     STEVE heads for the door.  Turns the handle.\n\n     As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the\n     box unfinished.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Don't!\n\n     Too late.  He turns the handle.   The door is flung\n     open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the\n     door, swings down into the hallway.\n\n     STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box\n     falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at\n     STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY\n     in the front line.\n\n     The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now\n     uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her,\n     its legs still bracing it in the door.\n\n     She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth\n     oozing fluids, almost catches her arm.\n\n     Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold\n     of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws.\n\n     Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and\n     flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily\n     relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its\n     hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her fingers.\n     The box defies her manipulations.\n\n<b>                             STEVE\n</b>                Come on!   Come on!\n\n     THE ENGINEER crawls towards them.  Up above, the din\n     of the roof collapsing.  Timbers and dust hurtle down\n     the stairs.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                Shit.  Shit.  Shit.\n\n     THE ENGINEER is almost upon her.  It rears up, its saliva\n     dropping on her.\n\n     And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into\n     place.\n<b> \n</b>     The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes\n     THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out\n     into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears.\n\n     Its voice grows thin, and fades.\n\n     Finally, silence.\n\n     The house is still.\n\n     KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same.\n\n     Together, they move to the door, and out onto the\n     step.\n\n\n<b>185  EXT.  DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n</b>\n     The door slams behind them, of its own accord.\n\n     KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand.\n\n     There is a slit in it which has not quite closed.  Light\n     suddenly pours from it, up into KIRSTY's face.  Her\n     features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards\n     the box.  From within:  shrieks, bells, music.\n\n     Between the screams, FRANK's voice.\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                Come to Daddy!\n\n     She slams the panel shut.  The distortions cease. So\n     does the din.\n\n<b>                             KIRSTY\n</b>                       (quietly)\n                Not tonight.\n\n     A smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep,\n     making her way towards the street.  STEVE gazes at her,\n     then follows.\n\n     Their figures are erased by the darkness.\n\n     Somewhere, a bell rings as ...\n\n<b>     THE CREDITS ROLL\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Hellraiser</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Clive Barker\" title=\"Scripts by Clive Barker\">Clive Barker</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Hellraiser Script.html#comments\" title=\"Hellraiser comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:14.838427"}
