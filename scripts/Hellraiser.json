Above this din one particular victim yells\n     for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage.\n\n     By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by\n     the surrounding tumult, until without warning his\n     voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time\n     reduced to naked scream.\n\n     And with the sound, an image.\n\n     A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three\n     storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining\n     its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there\n     is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin\n     to run, as we approach the house down the driveway.\n\n     We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are\n     louder now.\n\n     Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the\n     titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for\n     many years, though much of its furniture remains,\n     covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room,\n     a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life\n     here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a\n     glass.\n\n     We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the\n     lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the\n     floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn;\n     an open suitcase; more liquor.\n\n     We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper\n     landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light\n     within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into\n     the passageway.\n\n     As we reach the door, the screams from within halt\n     abruptly.\n\n     We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing\n     steadily throughout this opening sequence.\n\n     As we move through the door, the titles end.\n\n\n2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently,\n     disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them -\n     disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all\n     are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with\n     pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated,\n     others simply drip blood.\n\n     The bell tolls on.\n\n     On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches\n     square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle\n     box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function.\n     It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a\n     way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains\n     an enigma.\n\n     A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles,\n     reaches down and picks the box up.\n\n     In close up we see just what an elaborate construction\n     it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious\n     chambers.  It is open at present, its polished\n     innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played\n     on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to\n     one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                       (unseen)\n                It's over ...\n\n     Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box,\n     sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the\n     tune simplifying with each manoeuvre.\n\n     The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing\n     into the gloom.\n\n     We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning\n     from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch\n     sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest\n     of moments.  Then they're gone.\n\n     The box is almost returned to its unopened condition.\n\n     The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box,\n     and the bell.\n\n     It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid\n     into place.\n\n     The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune\n     stops.\n\n     At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the\n     window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is\n     dust settling through the air.\n\n     Otherwise it is empty.\n\n     The bell fades.\n\n     It's as if nothing ever happened here.\n\n     Except ...\n\n     Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be\n     the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp\n     of a thing barely alive.\n\n\n3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY\n\n     The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number\n     55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of\n     LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly\n     LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the\n     sound of keys tried in the lock.\n\n                             LARRY\n                It's one of these.\n\n                             JULIA\n                We're going to freeze to death.\n\n                             LARRY\n                0.K.  0.K.\n\n     The sound of another key tried in the lock.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Maybe somebody changed the lock.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (slightly irritated)\n                Like who?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just a thought -\n\n                             LARRY\n                Ah!\n\n     The key is turned.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Success.\n\n     The door swings open.\n\n                Voila!\n\n     We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American\n     in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost\n     his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks\n     too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him\n     is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English:\n     and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is\n     beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried\n     unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of\n     late: and LARRY has been a major part of their\n     disappointment.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Well.  This is it.\n\n     They step over the threshold.\n\n\n4    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     The door of the Torture Room creaks, as the wind blows\n     it opens an inch.  From downstairs, we hear JULIA's\n     voice.\n\n                             JULIA\n                It smells damp.\n\n                             LARRY\n                It's just been empty a while.\n\n\n5    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n    LARRY slams the front door.\n\n\n6    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     The Torture Room door creaks closed again.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (from below)\n                Besides, it's an old house.\n\n\n7    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     He stands in the hallway, not certain which way to\n     go from here.\n\n                             JULIA\n                How long since you were here?\n\n                             LARRY\n                The best part of ten years.\n\n     LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from\n     behind the door, then leads JULIA through from the\n     hallway to explore the ground floor.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I wanted to sell it off at\n                one point, after the old Lady\n                died, but I couldn't get Frank\n                to agree.\n\n     He opens one of the doors, and looks inside.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (with pleasure)\n                Christ.  It's not been touched.\n\n     He continues along the passageway.  He opens another\n     door, and steps into a large room.  He opens one of\n     the curtains.  Light pours in, dust-laden shafts falling\n     on the sheeted furniture.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Look at this.\n\n     JULIA lingers in the doorway.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Why didn't he want to sell it?\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (dismissively)\n                I don't know. Probably wanted\n                a hideaway.\n\n     He pulls a sheet off a chair.\n\n                Look at this stuff.\n\n     The chair is ugly; old fashioned.  JULIA is unimpressed.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Not exactly modern.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (shrugs)\n                We'll sell it.  Sell everything.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I thought half of it was your\n                brother's?\n\n                             LARRY\n                He won't complain.  He can pay\n                off some of his creditors.\n\n     LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by\n     the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA\n     to explore further.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You know we have to let Kirsty\n                see this place, before we do\n                anything to it.  She'll love it.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You mean we're moving in?\n\n     LARRY pauses.  Looks at her.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You don't like it?\n\n     JULIA shrugs.\n\n                             JULIA\n                It's better than Brooklyn.\n\n     She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then\n     follows.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You're still blaming me.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No.  I'm not.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You wanted to come back to\n                London.  We came back.\n\n     We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens\n     of times, which immediately annoys them both.\n\n                             JULIA\n                All right.\n\n                             LARRY\n                So what's the argument?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (cold)\n                No argument.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Oh Christ.  Julia ...\n\n     JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then\n     starts to climb.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (exasperated, to\n                        himself)\n                Shit.\n\n\n8    INT.   LANDING   DAY\n\n     JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed\n     feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses\n     her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them\n     is stale, like this house.\n\n\n9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     The door opens a fraction.\n\n\n10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY\n\n     LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains\n     of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence,\n     now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the\n     expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then,\n     from above:\n\n                             JULIA\n                Larry!\n\n     He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the\n     bottom of the stairs.\n\n                Larry!\n\n                             LARRY\n                I hear you.\n\n     He starts up the stairs.\n\n\n11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     LARRY reaches the top of the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Where are you?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (out of sight)\n                In here.\n\n     LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor.\n     JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom'\n     we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Squatters?\n\n     LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets.\n     Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and\n     starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a\n     lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked\n     up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets;\n     Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from\n     a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs.\n     LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking\n     intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed\n     with a naked Chinese girl.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Frank.\n\n     At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.\n\n                             JULIA\n                He's here?\n\n                             LARRY\n                He's been here.  There's stuff\n                in the kitchen.  He must have\n                made a hasty exit.\n\n     The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps.\n\n                That'll be Kirsty.\n\n     LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA\n     in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the\n     bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings.\n     As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's\n     face is close to tears.\n\n\n12   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY\n\n     The 'phone continues to ring.  LARRY steps through\n     and picks up the receiver.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Hello ...?\n\n     There's no answer.\n\n                Hello ...?\n\n\n13   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY\n\n     JULIA goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the\n     photographs.\n\n\n14   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM    DAY\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (on'phone)\n                Is there anybody there?\n\n     He puts down the 'phone.  He goes back out into the\n     hall.\n\n\n15   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY\n\n     Nervous that LARRY will return and see what she's\n     doing, JULIA is going through the photographs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (from below)\n                There's nobody there -\n\n     The sound of his foot on the stairs.  Hurriedly, she\n     selects a photograph of Frank without the girl, and\n     pockets it.\n\n\n16   INT.   STAIRS   DAY\n\n     LARRY is climbing the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'm surprised it's even connected ...\n\n     The 'phone rings again.\n\n                Shit.\n\n\n17   INT.   FRANK'S BEDROOM    DAY\n\n     Mission accomplished, JULIA leaves the bedroom, taking\n     one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the\n     indented pillar where Frank lay.  A lone wood-louse\n     crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds.  She\n     closes the door on the sight.  Downstairs, the\n     'phone stops ringing.\n\n\n18   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY\n\n     LARRY has picked up the 'phone.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Who's there?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (barely audible)\n                Daddy?\n\n                                            CUT TO\n\n\n19   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM    DAY\n\n     KIRSTY, the daughter of Larry's first marriage, and\n     his only child, on the 'phone.  She is barely twenty,\n     beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl-\n     next-door.  We can't see much of the room she's in at\n     the moment, the shot is too tight.\n\n                             LARRY   (V.0.)\n                Kirsty?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I got through.\n\n                             LARRY   (V.O.)\n                Where are you?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I found a room.\n\n\n20   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (on 'phone)\n                What did you say?\n\n\n21   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM   DAY\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I said: I found a room.\n\n     We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues to\n     speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair\n     by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty.\n     From outside, the sound of trains going by.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                I thought you were going to\n                stay with us for awhile?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (pained)\n                No Dad.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                You'd like the house.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                YOU'D like my room.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                Do you want me to come over?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (hastily)\n                No, no.  Not just yet.  It\n                needs ... er ... some work.\n\n     That it does.  The place, now we've got a good view\n     of it, is a total dump.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                Well I want you to see the\n                house.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I'm not going to change my\n                mind, Dad.\n\n     As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture,\n     tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts\n     collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's\n     a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there\n     to conceal.  Plaster falls from it.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (mouths the word)\n                Great.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                Well come over, will you?\n                See the place?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go\n                look for a job.\n\n                             LARRY (V.0.)\n                O.K. Honey. Well you take care.\n                I love you.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I love you too.\n\n     She puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small\n     table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She\n     covers her face with her hand.\n\n\n22   INT.   HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET    DAY\n\n     JULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Well?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (resigned)\n                Why not?\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (smiles; he's pleased)\n                We'll move in Sunday.\n\n\n23   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY\n\n     A church bell rings.  Off-screen, we hear voices:\n     two men are attempting to move a bed into the house\n     with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres.  We HEAR\n     their efforts, but we don't yet see them.  Our\n     interest is in JULIA, who is unpacking a tea-chest\n     in a room which is still full of draped furniture.\n\n                             1ST MAN (O.S.)\n                We're not going to get it in.\n\n                             2ND MAN (O.S.)\n                Tip it!  Tip it!\n\n                             LARRY (O.S.)\n                Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking\n                paint work.\n\n                             1ST MAN (O.S.)\n                Look, do you want the bed in or\n                not?\n\n                             LARRY (0.S.)\n                Just take it slowly.\n\n                             1ST MAN (O.S.)\n                Oh, sod you.\n\n                             2ND MAN (O.S.)\n                Eh, Chas, slow it down like\n                the man says.\n\n                             LARRY (O.S.)\n                It'll go in.\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                Famous last fucking words.\n\n     JULIA's face through this has been almost devoid of\n     expression.  She's holding so many feelings inside;\n     deep inside.  Now she moves from one box to another,\n     and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac.\n     She picks it up and goes through into the hallway.\n\n     The bell continues to ring.\n\n\n24   INT.   HALLWAY    DAY\n\n     The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the\n     door.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (not seeing Julia)\n                Alright, let's give it another\n                try.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                       (sees Julia)\n                Do you really need this bed, lady?\n\n     LARRY turns.  Sees JULIA.\n\n                             LARRY\n                How are you doing through\n                there?\n\n                             JULIA\n                It looks like a bomb's dropped.\n\n                             2ND MAN \n                Got any beer?\n\n                             JULIA\n                There's some in the 'fridge.\n\n     Nobody moves to get it.  Certainly JULIA has no\n     intention of being waitress.  She goes to the bottom\n     of the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'll get it.\n\n     LARRY disappears through into the kitchen.  JULIA\n     starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the\n     two men in the doorway.  One leans over and whispers\n     to the other, who laughs.  JULIA glances back at\n     them. The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning\n     of the gesture perfectly apparent.  JULIA heads\n     upstairs.\n\n\n25   EXT.   NUMBER 55     DAY\n\n     KIRSTY arrives at the head of the drive.  The two\n     men are drinking beers.  The bed has not been moved.\n\n     She wanders down the drive towards the house.\n\n\n26   EXT.   DOORSTEP    DAY\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                       (seeing Kirsty)\n                It's my lucky day.\n\n                             KIRSTY \n                Hi.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                Want to buy a bed?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Not much.\n\n     She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself\n     between the bed and the door-jamb.  They watch,\n     enjoying her efforts.\n\n\n27   INT.

She\n                hates moving.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (dryly)\n                Suprise.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (a gently chiding\n                        voice)\n                Kirsty.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                O.K.  I'll be nice.  You get\n                on with the muscle work.  I'll\n                make myself some coffee.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Kitchen's through on your left\n\n     KIRSTY kisses LARRY, and goes through to the kitchen.\n     LARRY turns back to the door.  The men have been\n     watching KIRSTY.  LARRY clearly dislikes the scrutiny.\n     1ST MAN, out-stared by LARRY, looks away.  The 2ND\n     MAN is unperturbed.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                That your daughter?\n\n                             LARRY\n                Uh-huh.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                       (grins oafishly)\n                Got her mother's looks.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Her mother's dead.\n\n     2ND MAN's grin fades.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                Oh.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Julia's my second wife.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                       (weakly)\n                Lucky man.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Damn right.  Now are we going\n                to move the bed or not?\n\n\n28   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY\n\n     The kitchen is chaotic.  Cutlery, crockery, utensils,\n     pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every\n     available surface.  KIRSTY has found the kettle,\n     but is having difficulty turning on the tap.  She\n     struggles with it.  No joy.  Just a rattling sound\n     in the pipes as the system lurches into action.\n\n\n29   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     The pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster.  The\n     CAMERA moves along the corridor, hugging the wall.\n     At the end of the corridor stands JULIA, in a\n     patch of sunlight.  She has the photograph of FRANK\n     in her hands.\n\n     She looks intently at it.\n\n     A CLOSE-UP of the photograph.  Then FRANK's voice.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Can I come in?\n\n     JULIA looks up from the photograph.\n\n\n30   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n\n     A front door opens.  On the step of another house\n     stands FRANK, with two suitcases.  It's raining\n     outside; HARD.  The rain has plastered his hair to\n     his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks.\n     He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense.\n     Again, the line she remembers:\n\n                             FRANK\n                Can I come in?\n\n     The splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of\n     water, as we\n\n                                            CUT BACK TO\n\n     the present day.\n\n\n31   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY\n\n     The tap has come on suddenly, spraying KIRSTY with\n     water.  She jumps back, soaked.\n\n                             KIRSTY \n                Shit!  Shit!\n\n     She reaches to turn the pressure down.\n\n\n32   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     The men are struggling with the bed again.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (calls through)\n                Are you O.K.?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (from kitchen)\n                Sure.\n\n\n33   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     Again, JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph.\n\n\n34   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n\n     The same scene:  FRANK in the doorstep.  Now we\n\n                                            CUT TO\n\n     the person who opened the door.  It's JULIA; a younger\n     JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes\n     brighter.  It is two weeks before her marriage to\n     LARRY.  She looks at the man on the doorstep without\n     a trace of recognition on her face.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You're Julia, right?\n\n                             JULIA\n                That's right.  Who are you?\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (a dazzling smile)\n                I'm brother Frank.\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (smiles)\n                Oh.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I came for the wedding.\n\n     He looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her\n     is almost mesmeric.\n\n     There is going to BE a wedding?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Oh.  Oh yes.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Well can I come in or not?\n\n                             JULIA\n                I'm sorry.  Of course.  You're\n                very welcome.\n\n     He steps inside.  Now he is close to her, rain running\n     down his face.  We can hear his breath; sense the\n     almost intimidating intimacy of his presence.\n\n                             FRANK\n                That's nice to know.\n                       (pause)\n                Have you got a towel?\n\n\n35   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     JULIA stares down at the photograph.  Off scrren,\n     KIRSTY's voice:\n\n                             KIRSTY (O.S.)\n                Have you got a towel?\n\n     JULIA looks up.  At the top of the stairs, KIRSTY\n     soaked from the tap.  JULIA looks up, and hurriedly\n     pockets the photograph.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Kirsty.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Hi.  I got soaked.\n\n                             JULIA\n                There's a towel in the bath-\n                room.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Which is where?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just to your left.\n\n     KIRSTY ducks into the bathroom.  We\n\n                                            CUT BACK TO\n\n     JULIA.  It's clear the memory of her first meeting\n     with FRANK has affected her deeply.  The tears that\n     threatened earlier are close.\n\n\n36   INT.   BATHROOM   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Did Dad tell you I got a room,\n                by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre\n                of the known universe.\n\n     Silence from outside.\n\n                Julia?\n\n                       (she puts her head\n                        out of the bathroom)\n\n\n37   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     JULIA has gone.\n\n\n38   INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     The door of the Torture Room is pushed open.  JULIA\n     steps inside.\n\n\n39   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY hears the creak of footsteps on the boards\n     above.  JULIA's behaviour puzzles her, but she's\n     not about to waste time thinking too hard about it.\n     She starts downstairs again.\n\n\n40   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     We have an odd, hovering point of view of JULIA,\n     as she steps inside the room.  Something about the\n     atmosphere distresses her.\n\n     There is a scratching sound.  She looks down.  A\n     wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls\n     along the edge of the skirting board.  She crosses\n     to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole\n     in the aged newspaper.\n\n     From downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers.\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                Have you got it?\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                I've got it.  I told you -\n\n                             LARRY\n                Wait!  Wait!\n\n     The light through the window falls on her eye.\n     The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges:\n\n\n41   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n\n     A bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between\n     the slats of bamboo blinds.  Outside we can hear\n     children playing summer games.  Inside, a fly buzzes.\n\n     JULIA, the younger self, is holding her wedding\n     dress in front of her, displaying it.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Well?\n\n                             FRANK (0.S.)\n                I don't want to see the dress.\n\n                             JULIA\n                But you said -\n\n                             FRANK\n                I don't want to see the dress.\n\n     JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front\n     of her.  She stares at FRANK.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You know what I want.\n\n     Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress\n     offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall.\n     She stares though, and there's an invitation in her\n     eyes.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I want you.\n\n     Now we\n\n                                            CUT TO\n\n     FRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene,\n     but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat\n     to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost\n     dangerous.\n\n     Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the\n     bed behind her.\n\n                             FRANK\n                That's better\n\n     FRANK steps towards her.\n\n                             JULIA\n                What about Larry -\n\n                             FRANK\n                Forget him.\n\n     FRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him,\n     though there is barely disguised fear on her face.\n     He puts his hand inside her blouse.\n\n\n42   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     In extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks into the light\n     through the window, as LARRY's voice from downstairs\n     calls her from her reverie.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Slowly, will you?  Slowly!\n\n     Again, a white-CUT, from which emerges:\n\n\n43   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY\n\n     The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now.\n     Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their\n     weight.\n\n     Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is\n     an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK\n     licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold\n     on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence\n     escalates into a series of strange details from\n     their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms;\n     sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And\n     once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching\n     FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity;\n     FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the\n     experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered\n     stranger still by the way the light through the window\n     falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them.\n\n     At last, as their urgency increases, we move up\n     until we're looking directly down on the bed.\n     From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the\n     ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms\n     are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed\n     as she murmurs:\n\n                             JULIA\n                Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh\n                my God.\n\n     The scene whites out.\n\n\n44   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     JULIA is still staring into the light.  She sobs, very\n     quietly.\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (a whisper)\n                Oh Frank ...\n\n\n45   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     Downstairs, LARRY and the men have moved the bed\n     across the hall to the bottom of the stairs.\n\n     All three are weary now, and getting careless.\n\n     As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead\n     for LARRY, whose hand is moving closer and closer\n     to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the\n     bannister.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (to Movers)\n                Will you take the weight while\n                I take a step up?\n\n     He backs towards the stairs - and the nail.\n\n                Damn it, will you take the -\n\n     The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail.  He cries\n     out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish,\n     drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from\n     the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Christ!\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                What's the problem?\n\n                             LARRY\n                My fucking hand!\n\n     He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand\n     from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He\n     lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You fucking ass-holes.\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                Who are you calling a fucking\n                ass-hole?  It's this bastard\n                bed that's your fucking problem!\n\n     LARRY isn't listening.  He's looking at the wound\n     in his hand.  He hates the sight of his own blood.\n     Any moment, he may faint.\n\n                             LARRY\n                ... Oh Christ ...\n\n     But not in front of these bastards.  He turns and\n     starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment.\n\n                             LARRY\n                ... oh ... Christ ...\n\n\n46   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     JULIA is standing in the middle of the room.  A single\n     dart of light, through the hole she tore in the\n     newspaper, strikes her face.  Softly on the soundtrack,\n     the scrabbling noise of the woodlice.\n\n\n47   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     The bed has been put down.  1ST MAN and 2ND MAN are\n     putting on their coats.  KIRSTY comes through from\n     the kitchen.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                What's happening?\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                We're leaving.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Where's my father?\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                He's fucked off.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                       (mock chiding)\n                Eh ... LANGUAGE.\n\n                             1ST MAN\n                Sorry.  He's gone upstairs.  So\n                we're fucking off too.\n\n     2ND MAN takes a sheet of paper from his jacket.\n\n                             2ND MAN\n                Will you sign for the bed?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Sure.\n\n\n48   INT.   STAIRS   DAY\n\n     LARRY, his hand running with blood, climbs the last\n     flight of stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (weakly)\n                ... Julia ...\n\n\n49   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     JULIA hears him, and turns from her silent communing with\n     the room.  She crosses towards the door.  Too late.\n     It opens.  LARRY steps inside, blood pouring from\n     his right hand, which he attempts to staunch with his\n     left hand.\n\n                             JULIA\n                What have you done?\n\n                             LARRY\n                I cut myself.\n\n     Blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them,\n     onto the bare boards.  Heavy splashes.\n\n     LARRY looks sick; his face clammy with sweat.  She stares\n     at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Is it deep?\n\n                             LARRY\n                I don't know, I haven't looked.\n                You know me and blood.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You're NOT going to faint.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (he leans againts\n                        the wall)\n                Shit.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Let me see.\n\n     She goes to him.  He looks away as she unglues one hand\n     from the other, and looks at the wound.  Blood comes faster,\n     hitting the floor between them.\n\n                             JULIA\n                It's probably going to need\n                stitches.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'm going to throw up.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No, you're not.\n\n     The blood keeps hitting the floor.  Slap; slap; slap.\n\n                We'll get you out into the\n                fresh air.\n\n     He is again clamping his hand over the wound, as JULIA\n     helps him to the door.  They leave the Torture Room.\n     We hear their voices receding down the passageway,\n     as we again assume that hovering view point.  The\n     floor, is heavily spattered with blood.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Take it slowly.\n\n                             LARRY\n                So damn stupid.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You're done worse.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'll be scarred for life.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No you won't.\n\n\n50   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY is half way up the stairs, as JULIA and LARRY\n     head down.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                What happened?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just an accident.  He's all\n                right.  Will you drive?  He\n                needs stitches.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Sure.\n\n                             JULIA\n                The keys are in the kitchen.\n\n     KIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY\n     towards the front door.\n\n     The CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and\n     begins to track ...\n\n     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     ... we continue to track, towards the Torture Room.\n\n     Downstairs, the front door slams.\n\n     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     From outside, the sound of a car door slamming.  An\n     engine starts.  The car drives away.\n\n     We move towards the blood on the floor.  As we watch,\n     it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the\n     room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not\n     quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless,\n     and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ...\n\n\n51   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     An explosion of laughter.  We\n\n                       CUT TO\n\n     the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed,\n     scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there.\n     This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a\n     battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen.\n     We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and\n     cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles.\n     Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the\n     table, while the others have retired to more comfortable\n     seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little\n     drunk.\n\n     The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles\n     are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are\n     pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially\n     cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re-\n     decorated.\n\n     We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize:\n     KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining\n     the gathering with an account of his accident.  The\n     others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL\n     UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with\n     LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work\n     colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk.\n     A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and\n     half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE,\n     it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY.\n\n     LARRY is half-way through his hospital story,\n     gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale,\n     much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and\n     lower arm are heavily bandaged.\n\n                             LARRY\n                - always hated the sight of my\n                own blood.  I go out like a light.\n                Anybody else's?  no problem.  But\n                mine ... you know ... goes straight\n                to my head.  Anyhow, this damn\n                doctor's poking around and I'm\n                saying: I'm going to pass out,\n                and he's saying, no you're not, no\n                you're not.  Next thing I know -\n\n     We\n\n                                            CUT BACK TO\n\n     JULIA, who watches her husband, unamused.\n\n                             LARRY\n                - I wake up On the floor.\n\n     Gales of laughter at this.\n\n                And it was HIM who was looking\n                sick.\n\n                             BILL\n                Probably thought you'd sue.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I should do it!\n\n                             EVELYN\n                Doctors -\n\n                             LARRY\n                I know.  And he's saying: I'm\n                sorry.  I'm sorry.\n\n                             BILL\n                HE'S sorry.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Right ...\n                       (he has picked up\n                        the brandy bottle)\n                Anyone for more?\n\n                             EVELYN\n                       (protests)\n                No ... no ...

Cointreau.\n\n     STEVE picks up the bottle.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I'll do it.\n\n     He fills up KIRSTY's glass.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I won't be able to stand.\n\n                             STEVE\n                So lie down.\n\n     She casts him a sly glance.  He smiles.  She smiles.\n\n     JULIA now stands up.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Would you excuse me?  I think\n                I'm going to go to bed.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Are you O.K.?\n\n     JULIA nods.\n\n                             BILL\n                       (looks at his watch)\n                Christ.

We've got celebrating\n                to do.\n\n     JULIA looks frosty, but LARRY does not catch the look.\n     KIRSTY does however.  BILL sits down.\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (to Julia)\n                It was a wonderful meal.\n\n                             EVELYN\n                       (gushing)\n                Oh it was.  It was wonderful.\n\n     There's a chorus of approval.  JULIA puts a smile on.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\n                             EVELYN\n                See you again soon.\n\n                             BILL\n                You must come round.\n\n                             EVELYN\n                Yes.  You must.  We're so happy\n                you're back.\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (at the door)\n                That's nice.  Well ... goodnight.\n\n     She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in\n     particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's\n     behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation\n     has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.\n\n                             EVELYN\n                Does it still hurt?\n\n                             LARRY\n                Only when I laugh.\n\n     This wins another round of laughter.\n\n\n52   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     JULIA walks along the landing, while the laughter - muted\n     by distance - wafts up from below.\n\n     From the floor above, she hears something more.\n     She stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight\n     of stairs towards the Torture Room.\n\n\n53   INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     She approaches the Torture Room, and steps inside.\n\n\n54   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here;\n     it's barely audible.  But there is another sound, a\n     shifting sound in the corner of the room.\n\n     She reaches for the light switch, and turns it on.\n     The bulb's been broken however.  She stares around\n     the room, trying to make sense of the shadows.\n\n     Nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four\n     streaks of light from the window fall.  Now she\n     looks towards the window and realizes that the\n     newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers.  Her\n     breath catches.  Suddenly, she's afraid.\n\n     She stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Who's there?\n\n     On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows.\n\n     JULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring\n     into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human\n     form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh,\n     raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall,\n     unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its\n     eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This,\n     though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (a pained whisper)\n                Julia.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Oh my God.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Don't look at me.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Who are you?\n\n                             FRANK\n                I said: don't look.\n\n     She looks away.\n\n                Help me.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Tell me who you are.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Frank.\n\n     JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No.  God no.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Believe me.  It's me.  It's\n                really me.\n\n                             JULIA\n                What happened to you?\n\n                             FRANK\n                His blood ... on the floor ...\n                It brought me back.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Back from where?\n\n                             FRANK\n                Just help, will you?  Please God,\n                help me -\n\n     From downstairs, dimly, laughter.\n\n\n55   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     LARRY has just told another story.  General drunken\n     laughter.  KIRSTY stands up.\n\n                             STEVE\n                You're not going?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Just upstairs.\n\n     She staggers a little bit.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Need any help?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I AM house-trained.\n\n     Further hysteria.\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (covered in embarrass-\n                        ment)\n                No ...

HALLWAY   NIGHT\n\n     She starts up the stairs.  She smiles to herself,\n     thinking of STEVE.\n\n\n57   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     FRANK, in the corner of the room, watches JULIA, who is\n     still at the door.\n\n                             FRANK\n                ... somebody ...\n\n                             JULIA\n                Ssh!\n\n     The sound of KIRSTY downstairs, closing the bathroom\n     door.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You can't let me stay like this.\n                Please.  You can't.\n\n                             JULIA\n                What do you want me to do.\n\n                             FRANK\n                The blood brought me this far.\n                I need more of the same.  Or\n                I'll slip back ...\n\n                                            CUT BACK TO\n\n     JULIA's lace as she stares at FRANK once more.  She\n     is appalled at the choice before her.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (a plea)\n                You have to heal me.\n\n\n58   INT.   BATHROOM   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY smiles at herself in the bathroom mirror, turns\n     off the tap, opens the door and steps out onto the\n     landing.\n\n\n59   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     She takes a step along the landing, then realizes\n     that there's somebody ahead of her, in the darkness.\n     She stops.  From the floor above, a soft sigh.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Hello?\n\n     JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned\n     light splashing up the stair well.The effect recalls\n     her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK.  The light\n     makes her look strange; ominous.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Oh, it's you.\n\n     JULIA doesn't smile\n\n                Are you all right?\n\n     Do we read murder in JULIA's eyes?  KIRSTY is uneasy.\n\n     Suddenly, a voice from the floor below.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Kirsty?\n\n     KIRSTY is relieved at the interruption.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (calls down)\n                I'm here.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I thought we'd lost you.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (calls down)\n                I'm coming!\n                       (to Julia)\n                Sleep well.\n\n     JULIA is left on the landing, as KIRSTY heads downstairs.\n\n\n60   EXT.   TUBE STATION   NIGHT\n\n     The station is deserted, but for KIRSTY and STEVE,\n     who are sitting, waiting for the last train.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                You know I do know the way home.\n\n                             STEVE\n                It's late.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Not that late.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Please.

A PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL, NEAR WATERLOO   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY and STEVE are walking.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Why don't you stay at Larry's\n                house?  There's plenty of room.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Yeah, there's room.  And\n                there's Julia.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I see.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                She's so damn ...

Up-tight.\n                Frigid.\n\n     STEVE stops walking.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I beg your pardon?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (lightly)\n                There ya go.\n                       (imitates his tone)\n                I beg your pardon?\n\n                             STEVE\n                We're not all frigid.\n\n     KIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are\n     aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on\n     their faces as they speak.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Oh no?\n\n                             STEVE\n                Oh no.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                It's not what I heard.\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (moves closer to\n                        her)\n                Well you've just been talking\n                to the wrong people.\n\n     He kisses her, with considerable feeling.\n\n\n62   INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     LARRY snores loudly.  JULIA lies beside him, wide\n     awake, staring at the ceiling.\n\n     LARRY turns over, muttering to himself.\n\n\n63   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The door opens.  JULIA is standing there, in her\n     night-gown.\n\n     FRANK raises his wretched head.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Well?\n\n     JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Yes.\n\n\n64   EXT.

PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY\n\n     The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables\n     full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the\n     melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things\n     at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody\n     else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining.\n     She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She\n     serves a table with their food, and then starts back\n     to pick up another order.   As she does so she's\n     harangued from every side.\n\n                             1ST CUSTOMER\n                Excuse me, Miss -\n\n                             2ND CUSTOMER\n                I'd like some more lager.\n\n                             1ST CUSTOMER\n                Miss!\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                In a moment.\n\n                             2ND CUSTOMER\n                Did you hear me?\n\n     KIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so\n     somebody else's voice cuts through the din.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Hey, sex-bomb -\n\n     She wheels round.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                You keep your -\n                       (sees Steve)\n                Oh.\n                       (smiles)\n                Hi.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I just called in.

She grins.\n\n                             2ND CUSTOMER\n                What do you have to do to get\n                some service around here?\n\n                             STEVE\n                Catch you later.\n\n\n68   INT.  BAR    DAY\n\n     By contrast, a quiet bar.   Discreet music;  a well-dressed\n     clientele.  Several couples occupy booths.  Other solitary\n     drinkers are at the bar.\n\n     Amongst them:   JULIA.\n\n     Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some\n     considerable effort to make herself ravishing.  There's\n     nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation\n     which shows off her considerable beauty.  She drinks soda\n     water.\n\n     She has an admirer.   Sitting alone at one of the tables\n     is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous,\n     slightly paunchy individual.  She glances over at him. His\n     eyes don't leave her for a moment.  He's trying his best\n     to get the courage to approach her.\n\n     She looks away, and concentrates on her drink.  Now she\n     takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. Her hands are\n     trembling slightly.  She lights the cigarette, draws on\n     it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that\n     she's not the equal of it.  She stubs the cigarette out,\n     puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave.\n\n     Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Not much fun, is it?\n\n                             JULIA\n                What?\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Drinking alone.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Not much.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                I wonder, maybe ...\n\n     He's so nervous he can barely speak.\n\n                ... as we're both on our own ...\n                we could have one drink together?\n\n     JULIA looks at him.  He seems to almost be offering\n     himself to her.   There's a long pause, while she tries\n     to make up her mind. Then:\n\n                             JULIA\n                Why not?\n\n     She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves\n     diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that\n     she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of\n     cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                       (to Julia)\n                What are you drinking?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just soda.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Plain soda?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Please.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                I try not to drink at lunch-\n                time.  Makes me sleepy in the\n                afternoon.  You like to keep\n                a clear head, eh?\n                       (to Barman)\n                One soda, one whisky.\n                       (to Julia)\n                I do it anyway.  No will-power.\n                Got a busy afternoon?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (looking straight\n                        at him)\n                That depends.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Oh?\n\n     He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly.\n     She stares back.  Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he\n     - scarcely believing his luck - returns.\n\n\n69   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     The CAMERA moves across the room. We can hear FRANK's\n     ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor\n     beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its\n     sides gleaming.  FRANK, still squatting on the floor,\n     taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers.\n\n     Then, voices outside:  JULIA laughs.\n\n     He raises his head.\n\n\n70   EXT.  DOORSTEP   DAY\n\n     JULIA opens the front door.  She is still very nervous,\n     fumbling with the keys.  PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her.\n\n\n71   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     They step inside.   JULIA closes the door\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                You know it's not often I ...\n                you know ...\n\n                             JULIA\n                There's a first time for every-\n                thing.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                I suppose that's right.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You want something to drink?\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                I'm already way over my usual\n                limit.  You know, it's funny.\n                I feel like I've known you for\n                years.\n\n     He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by\n     the alcohol he's drunk.  He kisses her.  She presses him off\n     her.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Oh, come on.\n                       (he takes hold of\n                        her breast)\n                It's what you brought me here\n                for, isn't it?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Yes.  I just think we'd be\n                better off upstairs.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Oh.  Oh fine.\n\n\n72   INT.  TORTUPE ROOM    DAY\n\n     FRANK's view, from the corner of the room.  We hear the\n     sound of JULIA and PRUDHOE's approach up the stairs.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                This your place?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Let's not talk about it.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                No personal details, right?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Right.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                You know, you're incredible -\n\n     JULIA opens the door.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Come on in.  Make yourself at\n                home.\n\n     She steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He\n     stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind\n     him.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                There's no bed.\n\n                             JULIA\n                That's right.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Huh?\n\n                             JULIA\n                I prefer the floor.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                First time for everything, right?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Right.\n\n     JULIA moves towards him\n\n                             JULIA\n                Why don't you take off your jacket?\n                You're warm.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Yeah, why don't I?\n\n     She slips the knot of his tie.  We can hear her pulse on\n     the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He\n     follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the\n     cheek.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                       (takes over his\n                       undressing)\n                Why don't you do the same?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Maybe I will.\n\n     PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying\n     not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant.\n\n     We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear.\n     He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton.\n     We move back into a tighter shot.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                       (voice slightly slurred)\n                You know, you're very beautiful.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Am I?\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                You know you are.  Loveliest\n                woman I ever set eyes on.\n\n     JULIA smiles.\n\n     PRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Oh Christ.\n\n                             JULIA\n                What's wrong?\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Too much drink.  Better empty\n                my bladder.\n\n     She steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                I'll be a moment.\n\n     As he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off\n     a hammer, which lies beside the wall.  PRUDHOE takes\n     hold of the door handle.  Turns it:  it's stuck.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                The door's stuck.\n\n     Before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head.\n     He doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back\n     of his shirt.   To avoid the following blow he stumbles\n     blindly towards the wall but JULIA's not going to be\n     stopped now.  He holds the back of his head - dazed,\n     apologetic, pitiful - while she moves towards him.\n\n                             PRUDHOE\n                Don't ... I ... please ...\n                I'm sorry ...\n\n     She eclipses him.\n\n                ... I'm so sorry ...\n\n     She raises the hammer.\n\n                ... I don't understand ...\n\n     She strikes him.  He slides down the wall, his jaw\n     broken, blood pouring from his face.   He twitches.  Then\n     the twitches stop.\n\n     She drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Enough?\n\n     The room sighs.   In the corner, FRANK's shadowy form\n     leans forward.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Don't look at me.\n\n     JULIA backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal\n     form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance.\n\n\n73   INT.  UPPER LANDING    DAY\n\n     JULIA steps out onto the landing and leans against the\n     wall, waves of sheer relief breaking over her.\n\n     In the room behind her, terrible sounds of feeding.\n\n\n74   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and looks at herself in\n     the mirror.   Blood is spattered on her face;  her hands\n     are similarly stained.  She is trembling from head to\n     foot.\n\n     Stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side\n     of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with\n     cold water.  Then she stares up at her face again,\n     examining it.  She can scarcely believe what she's done.\n\n\n75   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY\n\n     She crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the\n     Torture Room.\n\n\n76   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     She opens the door.\n\n     As she does so FRANK retreats into the shadows.  We are\n     granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than\n     before, but still horribly vulnerable.\n\n     JULIA looks at PRUDHOE's corpse.  A trail of blood leads\n     away from it into the darkness.  The body itself is a\n     grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat\n     withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn\n     back to expose the gums. A ghostly sight.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Jesus Christ.\n\n     JULIA looks across at FRANK, who is no longer sitting,\n     but standing in the shadows.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (his voice stronger)\n                Do I disgust you?\n\n     She doesn't reply.\n\n     He stretches his arm into a passage of light.  His flesh\n     glistens and pulses.\n\n                             FRANK\n                See?   It's making me whole\n                again.\n\n     He turns his arm over for her appreciation.\n\n                Every drop of blood you spill\n                puts more flesh on my bones.\n                And we both want that don't\n                we?\n\n     She nods.\n\n                Good.  Come here.\n\n     She stares, unable to move.\n\n                Come here, damn you.  I want\n                to touch you ...\n\n     Still she doesn't move.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (more softly)\n                Come to Daddy.  I only want to\n                touch ...\n\n     She takes a step towards his outstretched arm.   His\n     fingers touch her face.  She steels herself against them.\n     Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking\n     her.  Now her lips, caressingly.\n\n     Suddenly, a sound from downstairs.  The front door is\n     opened.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (from below)\n                Sweetheart?\n\n     JULIA withdraws from his touch\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (from below)\n                Where are you?\n\n\n77   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY\n\n     Shot from the stairs of LARRY.  He looks up the flight.\n     He takes a step towards the stairs.\n\n\n78   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA takes a step backwards, her foot hitting PRUDHOE's\n     corpse.\n\n\n79   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     LARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Are you there?\n\n     For a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the\n     stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through\n     to the back of the house.\n\n\n80   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes\n     and is now lifting it.  The body is lighter now, having\n     been drained of nourishment.  Its head lolls back and its\n     dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly.  She freezes.\n     No sound from below.  She backs out of the room with her\n     burden.\n\n     FRANK's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at\n     them.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Who's a pretty boy then?\n\n     Soft laughter from the darkness.\n\n\n81   INT.  JUNK ROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the\n     upper landing, open.  Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and\n     bric-a-brac.  She lays the body down.\n\n\n82   INT.  KITCHEN    DAY\n\n     LARRY has come through to look for JULIA.  He hears a\n     noise above.   He looks up.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (quietly)\n                Julia?\n\n     He leaves the kitchen.\n\n\n83   INT.  HALLWAY     DAY\n\n     Again, LARRY Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the\n     stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Are you there?\n\n     He starts up.\n\n\n84   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY\n\n     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door\n     behind her.\n\n     LARRY ascends to the top of the stairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Julia?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (from bathroom)\n                I'm here.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (at the door)\n                Sweetheart ... I've been\n                calling you.\n\n     He tries the door.  It's locked.\n\n                Are you all right?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just feeling a bit sick.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Oh, babe ...\n\n\n85   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA, still trembling, sits on the edge of the bath.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I'll be O.K.  Just leave me\n                be a while.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Can I get you anything?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Maybe a brandy.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Sure.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I'll be down in a minute\n\n                             LARRY\n                O.K.\n\n     She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and\n     stairs.    Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to\n     erase the signs of panic.  She puts a comb through her\n     hair, and adjusts her blouse.  That done, she unbolts the\n     door and steps out into the landing.  She doesn't go down\n     however, but UP,  back to the Torture Room.\n\n\n86   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     She opens the door.\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (very softly)\n                Frank?\n\n     A crunching sound in the shadows.  FRANK's hand opens,\n     dropping the pieces of PRUDHOE's dentures, which he has\n     crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I'm hurting\n\n                             JULIA\n                Hurting.\n\n                             FRANK\n                My nerves ... are beginning\n                to work again.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Good.\n\n                             FRANK\n                One more.  Maybe two -\n\n     JULIA's face registers no horrer at this.\n\n                - to heal me completely.   Then\n                we can be away from here, before\n                they come looking.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Who?\n\n                             FRANK\n                The Cenobites.  It's only a matter\n                of time before they find I've\n                slipped them. I have to get away\n                from here.\n\n     From downstairs, LARRY.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Julia?   Are you all right?\n\n     JULIA crosses to the door and calls down.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Just a moment.  Put on some\n                music will you babe?\n\n                             LARRY\n                O.K.\n\n     She returns to her conversation with FRANK.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Keep your voice down.\n\n     She crosses to close the door.   When she turns round,\n     he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window,\n     his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom.  Suddenly\n     he reaches out and catches hold of her arm.  She gasps\n     in pain.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You're hurting.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You won't cheat me will you?\n                You'll stay with me.  Help me.\n                Then we can be together, the\n                way we were before.  We belong\n                to each other now, for better\n                or worse ...\n\n     He lets go of her.\n\n                ... like love.  Only real.\n\n     She goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind\n     her.\n\n     We move close to FRANK's face.   He licks his skinned\n     lips with a bloody tongue.  Thunder rolls.\n\n\n87   KIRSTY'S DREAM\n\n     The thunder carries over to a dream.\n\n     We are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that\n     everything is once more shrounded in sheets.\n\n     We CUT to KIRSTY, moving through the room, her face pale,\n     her hair glued to her forehead with sweat.\n\n     Somewhere, a bell is ringing.  Flies buzz.  On the\n     dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet.  It's clear\n     that the shape is human.  She reaches the table, and\n     looks at the body.\n\n     Suddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning\n     at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the\n     body.  There are sobs beneath the shroud.\n\n     She reaches for it, to snatch it off the body.\n\n     The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet.\n\n     She pulls.\n\n     We glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked\n     body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot.\n\n     She screams.\n\n     Her scream becomes louder, as we\n\n                                               CUT TO\n\n88   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     STEVE sits bolt upright in bed, while KIRSTY yells.\n\n     The sheet is snatched off him.  He looks across the room\n     to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed, with the sheet in\n     her hand.\n\n                             STEVE\n                What are you doing?\n\n     KIRSTY's eyes are still closed.\n\n                Kirsty!\n\n     Her eyes open.  She looks down at the sheet she's snatched\n     from the bed, and drops it in horror.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Christ.  What was that about?\n\n     KIRSTY, weak with fear, just shakes her head.\n\n\n89   INT.  HALLWAY, NUMBER 55    NIGHT\n\n     A phone is ringing.\n\n     LARRY crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears\n     from sight.   The phone is picked up.\n\n                             LARRY'S VOICE\n                Hello?\n\n\n90   INT.  BEDROOM    NIGHT\n\n     JULIA lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her.   She's\n     wide awake, staring at the ceiling.   Downstairs, the\n     murmur of LARRY's voice.\n\n\n91   INT.  TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     FRANK stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly\n     in the shadows.\n\n\n92   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     LARRY is on the phone.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'm O.K., honey.  It's all\n                right ...\n\n\n93   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY is on the phone.   STEVE sits up in bed, having\n     reclaimed the sheet.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I just wanted to be sure you\n                were O.K.\n\n\n94   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM    NIGHT\n\n                             LARRY\n                Never better.  You sleep well.\n\n                             KIRSTY (on phone)\n                Yeah.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I love you, honey.\n\n                             KIRSTY (on phone)\n                I love you too.\n\n     LARRY puts down the phone.\n\n\n95   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY\n\n     LARRY returns to the bedroom.\n\n                             JULIA (O.S.)\n                Who was it?\n\n                             LARRY\n                Kirsty.\n\n     He goes into the bedroom.\n\n     We PAN up the second flight of stairs.\n\n     FRANK is sitting at the top, in the shadows.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (soft as a breath)\n                Kirsty.\n\n\n96   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY\n\n     The front door is closed by JULIA.   A man stands in\n     the hallway:  another VICTIM.   He is as nervous as\n     PRUDHOE.\n\n                             VICTIM\n                You're sure we're not going to\n                be interrupted -\n\n                             JULIA\n                Quite sure.\n\n                             VICTIM\n                Only I like to be careful.\n\n\n97   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY\n\n     A shock CUT to the naked VICTIM, thrown back against\n     the wall from JULIA's hammer blow.  Before he can even\n     slide down the wall, FRANK is upon him.\n\n     We don't linger, but CUT away to:\n\n\n98   INT.  LANDING    DAY\n\n     As JULIA closes the door, her face devoid of emotion,\n     we see the VICTIM's body on the floor, with FRANK's\n     hands oh its head, draining out its energies.\n\n\n99   INT.  DINING ROOM    DAY\n\n     JULIA sits, sipping a drink, her face still unreadable.\n\n\n100  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  The VICTIM's body\n     is in the middle of the room.\n\n     JULIA enters.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Well?\n\n                             FRANK\n                Better.  Much better.  I'd\n                like some clothes.  And maybe\n                a cigarette.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Then you tell me ... you\n                explain what happened to you?\n\n                             FRANK\n                Of course.\n\n\n101  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     We pan across the walls as FRANK speaks.\n\n                             FRANK (O.S.)\n                I wanted access to experiences ...\n                pleasures ... that only they\n                could offer ...\n\n                             JULIA (O.S.)\n                The Cenobites.\n\n                             FRANK\n                That's what they call themselves.\n                They're not human.  Maybe they\n                were once, but they're not now.\n                They rearrange their own flesh\n                for pleasure.\n\n     We've moved across to FRANK now.  He is dressed,\n     in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which\n     his blood is seeping.  He smokes, taking great\n     pleasure in the experience.\n\n                             JULIA\n                And the box?\n\n     FRANK picks up the box.  Vague, tantalizing forms\n     move over the surface, like ghosts.\n\n                             FRANK\n                It cost me a fortune.  All I\n                had.  It's a puzzle you see.\n                You solve it, and the Cenobites\n                come through ...\n\n                             JULIA\n                Where from?\n\n                             FRANK\n                God knows.  Sometimes I think\n                they're just behind the walls ...\n\n     He turns the box over.  The lacquer catches the light.\n\n                             JULIA\n                So they cheated you\n\n     In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's\n     difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is\n     this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?\n\n                             FRANK\n                Oh no.  They kept to their\n                bargain.  They gave me\n                experiences I'd never forget ...\n\n     The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and\n     they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running\n     across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.\n\n                             FRANK\n                But their pleasure was my pain.\n\n     His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the\n     box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing\n     between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's\n     faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Terrible pain.  Appalling ...\n\n     He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes\n     on, his voice heavy.\n\n                My body was forfeit.  But my\n                spirit ... they left that here.\n                In the boards.  In the walls.\n                Watching the world, but never\n                able to touch it ...\n\n                             JULIA\n                And the blood let you out?\n\n                             FRANK\n                There are ways to resurrection.\n                Blood's one of them.  I won't\n                let them take me back, Julia.\n\n     JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands\n     his desire.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I want to be whole, and then\n                get out -\n\n     He lifts the box up.\n\n                I won't let them take me.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You won't have to.  We'll be\n                gone.  Somewhere they'll\n                never find us.\n\n     There's a rumble of thunder.\n\n                Not in the whole wide world.\n\n\n102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the\n     windows.\n\n     The television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on\n     the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He\n     has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside\n     his feet; and there's another in his hand.\n\n     JULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen\n     to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is\n     starting to flow.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Is this upsetting you?\n\n                             JULIA\n                I've seen worse.\n\n     LARRY looks at her.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Are you all right?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Fine.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Only I'll turn it off -\n\n     There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen,\n     as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY\n     turns his attention back to the match.\n\n                             COMMENTATOR\n                And he's down!  He's down!\n\n     The thunder rolls on.\n\n\n103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The lightning finds its way through the holes in\n     the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window,\n     his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand,\n     on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's\n     tapped out before.  He turns away from the window,\n     and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the\n     floor.\n\n\n104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The boxing match is heating up again.\n\n                             COMMENTATOR\n                - and now he's in trouble,\n                he's really in trouble - \n\n                             LARRY\n                What was that?\n\n     JULIA looks up from her magazine.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Thunder.\n\n     The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen\n     faces burst beneath punches.\n\n                             LARRY\n                No.  Something else.\n\n     LARRY stands up.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Maybe I left a window open -\n\n     She gets up and crosses to the door.\n\n                - I'll go see.\n\n                             LARRY\n                No.  I'll do it.\n\n     He opens the door, and steps out into the hallway.\n\n\n105  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     In such tight close up we can't sec that FRANK has\n     in fact left the Torture Room, we see his features\n     register that somebody is coming.\n\n\n106  INT.   STAIRWAY   NIGHT\n\n     LARRY is climbing the stairs.  JULIA follows.\n\n                             JULIA\n                It was nothing.\n\n     LARRY has reached the top of the stairs.  He looks up\n     the next flight.\n\n                Larry ...\n\n                             LARRY\n                What's wrong with you?\n\n     She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture\n     Room.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I just hate the thunder.\n\n     He crosses to her.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'm here.\n\n     He puts his arms around her.  She responds.\n\n                You're shaking.\n\n     He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly. The thunder\n     shakes the house.\n\n                There's nothing to be afraid\n                of.\n\n     He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her.\n\n                I'll just go check upstairs ...\n\n     He kisses her again.  She, in order to distract him,\n     kisses him back.  Her passion is artificial, but he\n     doesn't register that.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Oh baby.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Don't go upstairs.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Come with me then.\n\n     He starts up the stairs.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Please ...\n\n\n107  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     He reaches the top of the stairs.  First he throws\n     open the Junk Room.  Lightning flashes on boxes\n     inside.  Then he moves towards the Torture Room.\n     The thunder rolls more loudly.\n\n     She follows him along the landing, desperate to stop\n     him.\n\n     Too late.  He throws open the door.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Don't.\n\n     Lightning floods the room.  It's empty.  She stands\n     beside him at the door.\n\n                             LARRY\n                We must have rats.\n\n     She looks back down the stairs.  Where's FRANK gone?\n     LARRY turns to her, holding her again, on the\n     threshold of the Torture Room.\n\n                             LARRY\n                See?  Quite safe.\n\n     He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss.\n\n                Let's go  down.  I'll make it\n                better.\n\n     He kisses her again.\n\n\n108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     A shadow moves across the screen as the door opens,\n     and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's\n     hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed,\n     illuminated by the light from the landing, and the\n     occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels\n     between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes\n     closed.\n\n     JULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She\n     senses FRANK's presence.\n\n                             LARRY\n                ... oh babe ...\n\n     He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted\n     by her suspicions; he has his hands against her\n     almost before she realizes what's happening.\n\n     We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The\n     dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the\n     window.  Does something move in the shadows?\n\n     A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing.\n\n     LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him,\n     kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly\n     dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK,\n     but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is\n     so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he\n     doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is\n     elsewhere.\n\n     Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of\n     the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder\n     and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we\n     can barely make out.\n\n                             LARRY\n                ...I love you, honey ... let\n                me ... oh God ... I love you ...\n\n     Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a\n     tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace\n     of eroticism from the scene.\n\n     A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows\n     just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes\n     closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's\n     body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK\n     is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious\n     to all of this, of course.\n\n     We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making.\n     Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan\n     of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Oh baby ... I love you ...\n\n     From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble\n     towards the lovers.\n\n     From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed,\n     LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what\n     he intends.\n\n                             JULIA\n                ... no ...\n\n     LARRY barely hears her.\n\n     FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA\n     becomes highly agitated.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE.\n                No.\n\n     LARRY stops his love-making.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (looks at her)\n                Huh?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Please ...\n\n                             LARRY\n                What's wrong with you?\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (almost sobbing)\n                Please.  I can't bear it ...\n\n     LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He\n     disengages his arms from around her.\n\n     JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats.\n\n     LARRY rolls off JULIA.\n\n     The wardrobe door closes.  Click.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I don't understand you.  One\n                moment you're all over me, the\n                next it's:  Don't touch me.\n\n     He sits on the edge of the bed.\n\n                I just don't understand.\n\n     He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where\n     she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it,\n     from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the\n     wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK\n     stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his\n     face; his skeletal grin.\n\n     Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof,\n     we hear laughter.\n\n\n109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING\n\n     KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together,\n     in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite,\n     to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept\n     for several nights.  KIRSTY, by contrast, is sparkling\n\n                             LARRY\n                ... maybe we should never\n                have come back.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Maybe you should give it some\n                time.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I guess.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (skirting her real\n                       feelings)\n                She's not like Mom.  She's ...\n                I don't know ... moody.  I thought\n                that was what you liked about her.\n\n                             LARRY\n                You don't like her at all do you?\n\n     The straight-forward question silences KIRSTY for a\n     moment.  She wants to be delicate with her father's\n     feelings, but honest at the same time.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I don't know her.  She's so ...\n                sealed up.\n\n     LARRY's face is full of the desire for reassurance.\n     KIRSTY tries to offer it.\n\n                If YOU love her she must be\n                worth loving.  Just give me\n                some time.\n\n     LARRY nods, a weak smile on his face\n\n                             LARRY\n                She doesn't even want to leave\n                the house.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Really?\n\n                             LARRY\n                It's like she's waiting for\n                something.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                What?\n\n                             LARRY\n                I don't know.  I don't know.\n                It's beyond me.\n\n     A silence.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (hesitant)\n                Would you ... maybe call round\n                sometime?  Try to make friends.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Sure.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Maybe all she needs is some\n                company.\n\n\n110  INT.   STAIRCASE   DAY\n\n     FRANK is standing at the top of the stairs, dressed in\n     his stained suit.  JULIA is a few steps down, staring\n     up at him.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You can't love him.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I don't.\n\n                             FRANK\n                So where's the harm?\n\n                             JULIA\n                I said no.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Then find me somebody else, \n                before they come looking.\n\n     JULIA nods.\n\n                Tomorrow?\n\n     She looks at him.\n\n\n111  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET - DAY\n\n     A wind blows, carrying autumn leaves before it.  And\n     on the wind, the distant pealing of bells.\n\n\n112  EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY\n\n     JULIA is at the door, turning the key in the lock.\n     Beside her, a third sacrificial lamb, balding and\n     excitable.  His name is SYKES.\n\n     JULIA opens the door.\n\n\n113  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY\n\n     At the corner of the street now:  KIRSTY.  She watches,\n     puzzled.\n\n\n114   EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY\n\n     A long shot of the house, from KIRSTY'S P.O.V.  The\n     man on the step seems to having second thoughts.\n     JULIA speaks with him.  We can hear none of this\n     exchange, but JULIA manages to coax him inside.  She\n     closes the door behind them.\n\n\n115  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY stands, bewildered by what she's seen.\n\n\n116  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     From the top of the stairs we watch JULIA lead SYKES\n     upstairs.\n\n                             SYKES\n                I get lonely sometimes.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Everybody does.\n\n\n117  EXT.   STREET   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY starts towards the house.\n\n\n118  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     In the corner of the room FRANK stands, tapping out\n     the rhythm with his fingers.  It's 'Colonel Bogey',\n     and now he hums it too.  Outside the door, a footfall.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Come in.\n\n     The humming stops.\n\n     JULIA opens the door.\n\n\n119  EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY starts down the path.\n\n\n120  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     SYKES is looking at JULIA.\n\n                             SYKES\n                What is this?  A game?\n\n     FRANK moves in the corner.  SYKES catches the motion\n     from the corner of his eye.  He turns.\n\n                What ?\n\n     FRANK steps from the shadows.\n\n                Jesus Christ.\n\n     JULIA hits him with the hammer.\n\n\n121  EXT.   DOORSTEP   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY hears SYKES scream.  She freezes.  Then steps\n     back from the doorstep and looks up at the house.\n\n\n122  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     In the Room, pandemonium.  SYKES, blood pouring down\n     his face, flails out at JULIA.  The hammer flies from\n     her hand.  He lunges for the door, but she manages\n     to kick it closed.\n\n                             SYKES\n                Christ help me!\n\n\n123  EXT.   HOUSE   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house.\n\n\n124  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     SYKES has taken hold of JULIA, and is using her as\n     a shield against FRANK, whos is bearing down upon\n     him.  For the first time we see FRANK's true colours\n     where JULIA's concerned -\n\n                             SYKES\n                       (to Frank)\n                Don't!\n\n     Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing.\n\n     FRANK descends on SYKES.\n\n                             SYKES\n                No!\n\n\n125  INT.   KITCHEN   DAY\n\n     SYKES' scream covers the sound of KIRSTY forcing the\n     back door open.  She steps inside.\n\n\n126  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     FRANK has SYKES face to the wall.  SYKES is sobbing now.\n     The room is covered in blood.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (to Julia)\n                Get out of here.\n\n     She picks herself up.\n\n                             SYKES\n                       (to Julia)\n                Please ... don't let him kill\n                me ... please ...\n\n     JULIA leaves, closing the door.\n\n     FRANK seizes hold of SYKE's neck, his fingers entering\n     the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae.  SYKES screams.\n\n\n127  INT.   KITCHEN/DINGING ROOM/HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY moves through the house, and starts to climb the\n     stairs.\n\n\n128  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     Half way up the stairs, the scream stops.  She climbs\n     the rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush.\n\n\n129  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     A soundless, slowed shot, as SYKES, his face wasted\n     by FRANK's feeding, breaks from FRANK's hold and\n     lunges for the door.\n\n\n130  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs.\n\n\n131  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     The same slowed, soundless horror, as SYKES reaches\n     the door.  FRANK is a pace behind him.\n\n\n132  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY reaches the top as -\n\n\n133  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     The door from inside the room.  SYKES pulls it open -\n\n\n134  INT.   TORTURE ROOM FROM LANDING   DAY\n\n     In real time, and accompanied by the most horrific\n     shriek, SYKES flings himself from the Torture Room.\n     The flesh is hanging off his face; his eyes bulge\n     in terror.\n\n     Seeing KIRSTY he starts towards her.  Behind him,\n     FRANK, his body glistening.  He catches hold of SYKES\n     by the neck. SYKES'  shrieks stop.  The eyes glaze\n     over.  The body judders as death claims it.  Then\n     FRANK drops the corpse, and looks up at KIRSTY.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Oh my God.\n\n     She starts to back away down the stairs.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (shouts)\n                Julia!\n\n                             FRANK\n                Kirsty?\n\n     He takes a step towards her.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Keep your fucking distance.\n                Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ,\n                what have you done with her.\n\n     She's still backing away. He's still advancing.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's\n                Uncle Frank.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                No.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You remember.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                No.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Come to Daddy.\n\n     Her puzzlement, however, has slowed her retreat, \n     and now FRANK reaches for her.  At the last moment\n     she backs away again, but he's after her in a beat,\n     and seizes hold of her.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                No.  Get the fuck off me.\n\n     He drags her back up the stairs.\n\n\n135  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY\n\n     He pushes her ahead of him, into the Torture Room.  He\n     closes the door.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You've grown.  You're beautiful.\n\n     She has retreated as far from him as she can get.  He\n     advances on her.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Don't touch me.  Or so help\n                me -\n\n                             FRANK\n                What?  What will you do?  What\n                can you do?\n                       (pause)\n                There's nothing to be frightened\n                of.\n\n     FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold\n     of her face.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I bet you make your Daddy proud,\n                don't you?  Beautiful.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                This isn't happening.\n\n                             FRANK\n                I used to tell myself that.\n                Used to try and pretend I was\n                dreaming all the pain.  But why\n                kid yourself?  Some things have\n                to be endured.  Take it from me.\n                And that makes the pleasures so\n                much sweeter ...\n\n     As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the\n     pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his\n     abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids.\n     FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams.\n     She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after\n     her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It\n     tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin.\n\n     She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is\n     slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over\n     it.  She falls, heavily.\n\n     Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her.\n\n     On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a\n     poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes\n     after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow\n     to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for\n     the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her.\n     She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now.\n     Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more.\n\n     She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what\n     she's holding.  His  attack stops.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Give that to me.\n\n     She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (breathless)\n                No.\n\n                             FRANK\n                One last time.  Give me the\n                box.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                You want it?\n\n     The monster's eyes glitter.\n\n                Fucking have it!\n\n     She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes\n     through the window.\n\n                             FRANK\n                NO!\n\n     He goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's\n     out of the door in a moment.\n\n                NO!\n\n\n136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY\n\n     KIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the\n     stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her.\n\n\n137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY\n\n     She flings open the front door, and pitches herself -\n     bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond.\n\n\n138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY\n\n     As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box\n     at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks\n     it up, and continues to run.\n\n\n139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY\n\n     A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers\n     along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image\n     threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare\n     at her as she runs.  A child points.\n\n     Finally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still.\n\n     A voice, off camera:\n\n                             VOICE (O.S.)\n                Are you all right?\n\n     The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of\n     the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view.\n\n                             WOMAN\n                Do you need any help?\n\n     As she speaks, the picture fades to white.\n\n\n140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO)\n\n     The whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant,\n     incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood\n     in the inner ear.\n\n     Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like\n     Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as\n     sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness,\n     soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet\n     in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous\n     dialogue.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Come to Daddy.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                This isn't happening.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Some things have to be endured ...\n\n     The darkness is filling the screen\n\n                ... take it from me ...\n\n     Now, total darkness.\n\n                ... Come to Daddy ...\n\n     And suddenly, she wakes.\n\n\n141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room.  A NURSE\n     is at her bedside, monitoring her condition.\n\n                             NURSE\n                You're awake.\n\n     She goes to the door.\n\n                I'll get the doctor.\n\n     She exits.\n\n     KIRSTY tries to sit up.  Her head hurts, badly.  As she\n     achieves a sitting position, the door opens.  The\n     NURSE returns, with a DOCTOR.\n\n                             DOCTOR\n                       (approaching the bed)\n                So ... you're back with us.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I think so.\n\n                             DOCTOR\n                How are you feeling?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Tender.\n\n                             DOCTOR\n                You took quite a beating.  Do\n                you remember what happened?\n\n     She looks at him, uncertain of where to start.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I want to speak to my father ...\n\n                             DOCTOR\n                       (nods)\n                Of course.  We'll bring you a\n                telephone.\n\n     The NURSE exits.  The DOCTOR brings the box from his\n     pocket.\n\n                Maybe this'll jog your memory.\n\n     He lays it on the bed.  She stares at it, her expression\n     betraying nothing.\n\n                I had the Devil's own job\n                getting it out of your hand.\n                Does it ring any bells?\n\n     She shakes her head.\n\n                Do you want it left?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Why not?\n\n     He offers her a reassuring smile.\n\n                             DOCTOR\n                Chin up.  There's no serious\n                damage.  And you're safe here.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Um.\n\n     He leaves the room.\n\n     KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it\n     over in her hand, examining it.\n\n\n142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  He is wearing a\n     fresh shirt.  He smirks.   JULIA watches him.\n\n     Downstairs, the telephone rings.  JULIA is very\n     nervous now; desperate even.\n\n                             JULIA\n                She'll tell them everything ...\n\n                             FRANK\n                I don't think so.  She'll want\n                Larry first.\n\n                             JULIA\n                That's probably her now.  Or\n                the police.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Maybe.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Don't you care?\n\n                             FRANK\n                There's very little I can do\n                about it.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Maybe we should just leave -\n\n                             FRANK\n                Like this?  Look at me! LIKE\n                THIS?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Well we can't just stay here -\n\n                             FRANK\n                I need a skin.  Then we leave -\n\n\n143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY is sitting up in bed.  On the bedside table,\n     a telephone.  She is now thoroughly engrossed in the\n     problems of the box.  Her fingers speed over the\n     surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its\n     strength.\n\n     Suddenly, a click.  Her face lights up with pleasure,\n     as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new\n     intricacies.  And to accompany the revelation, a\n     tinkling tune.\n\n     She smiles.  It's a musical box.\n\n     The light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't\n     notice.\n\n     The door opens.  It's the NURSE.\n\n                             NURSE\n                Comfortable?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (smiles)\n                Sure.\n\n                             NURSE\n                Any luck with your father?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (shakes her head)\n                He's probably got a meeting.\n                I called a friend of mine.  He's\n                coming; is that O.K.?\n\n                             NURSE\n                Of course.\n\n     The NURSE exits.  As she does go the light flickers again.\n     The box clicks.  A new facet is revealed ...\n\n     KIRSTY smiles.\n\n\n144  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT\n\n     The front door closes.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (inside)\n                Julia?\n\n\n145  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT\n\n     LARRY stands in the hall.  JULIA comes down the stairs.\n     She looks pale; even ill.\n\n                             LARRY\n                What's wrong?\n\n                             JULIA\n                I don't know where to begin ...\n\n                             LARRY\n                What are you talking about?\n\n                             JULIA\n                It's better you see for your-\n                self -\n\n     She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows.\n\n\n146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more\n     complex now.\n\n     Somewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works\n     the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light\n     flickers and goes out.\n\n     The bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She\n     drops it, shocked.\n\n     The bedside light comes on again.\n\n     She looks up.\n\n     In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow\n     doorway has simply opened in the wall.\n\n     Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to\n     the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant,\n     rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway.\n\n\n147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT\n\n     We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against\n     a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor.\n\n\n148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor -\n     which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely\n     dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down\n     it or not.\n\n     She glances towards the door of her room, from the other\n     side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital\n     going about its business.  What's to fear?\n\n\n149  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT\n\n     She steps into the corridor.    The walls rise into\n     darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like\n     the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and\n     rotting away.\n\n     She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on\n     the impacted earth of the passageway.\n\n     The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form\n     disappearing entirely as she passes through the\n     intermittent darkness.\n\n     Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to\n     reassure herself that it's still there.  It is,\n     though it's no more than a sliver of light at the\n     far end of the passageway.\n\n     She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is\n     growing denser; smoke thickens the air.\n\n     Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor.\n\n     The sound of the sobbing child ceases.\n\n     She stops walking.\n\n     Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we\n     see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space\n     between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the\n     light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles\n     no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it\n     suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone.\n     Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down\n     from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over\n     its back.\n\n     KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER\n     moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits.\n     From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom,\n     glides into view.\n\n     And then -\n\n     - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by\n     bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a\n     growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when\n     all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it\n     finds the light.\n\n     KIRSTY turns, and starts to run.\n\n     It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness,\n     light; roars and silence -\n\n     Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam.\n\n     KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the\n     safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her\n     heels, lingering -\n\n     As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes\n     on her.\n\n\n150  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     She flings herself through the door with THE ENGINEER's\n     breath on her back, and turns -\n\n     The doorway has gone.  The wall is sealed.  She approaches\n     the wall.   THE ENGINEER scratches on the other side ...\n\n     Then, she realises that the bell is still ringing.  And\n     there's a foul smell in the air.\n\n     She looks around.\n\n     She's not alone.\n\n     Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange\n     phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four\n     extraordinary figures.\n\n     They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated\n     by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear\n     are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh,\n     laced through skin in places, hooked into bone.\n\n     The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head\n     at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is\n     pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying\n     them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping\n     rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and\n     a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark\n     glasses.\n\n     When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as\n     that of the creature from the beginning of the film.\n\n     KIRSTY stares in amazement.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Where the hell did you come from?\n\n     The CENOBITE gestures.  The box is lying on the bed.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                The box ... you opened it.\n                We came.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                It's just a puzzle box.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                It's a means to summon us -\n                it's called the Lament Con-\n                figuration.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Who are you?\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Cenobites.  Explorers in the\n                further regions of experience.\n                Demons to some.  Angels to\n                others.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Well, I didn't mean to open\n                that thing.  You can go back\n                wherever you came from.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                We can't.   Not alone.\n\n     At this, the creature with the wired open jaw chatters\n     like a mad monkey.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                This isn't for real.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                You solved the box.  We came.\n                Now you must come with us.\n                Taste our pleasures.\n\n     The chattering CENOBITE steps towards her.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Don't touch me!\n\n     The door opens.  It's STEVE.\n\n     KIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not\n     register the CENOBITES' presence however.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Steve.  Thank God you came.\n\n                             STEVE\n                What happened to you?\n\n     He steps between the CENOBITES.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                These THINGS ... they want to\n                take me -\n\n                             STEVE\n                What things?\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                       (to Kirsty)\n                He doesn't see us, or hear us.\n                We belong to you, Kirsty.  And\n                you to us.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                No!\n\n                             STEVE\n                What's wrong?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Don't let them take me, Steve -\n\n                             STEVE\n                I won't let anybody take you.\n\n     He starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the\n     dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts\n     the hook to STEVE's neck.   STEVE's hand moves to the\n     place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE\n     takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes\n     beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook.\n     STEVE winces.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                If he takes another step, we\n                open his throat.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (to Steve)\n                Please go, Steve.\n\n                             STEVE\n                What?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K.\n                I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll\n                look after me -\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (protesting)\n                What did I say?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Will you GO, damn you?\n\n     Mystified, STEVE retreats a step.\n\n                             STEVE\n                I'll come back later, huh?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Sure.  Why not?\n\n     Still puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door.\n\n                             STEVE\n                'Bye.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                'Bye.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                Good.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                It's time we were away.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (almost crying)\n                Let me alone, will you?\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                No tears please.  It's a waste\n                of good suffering.\n\n     The chatterer comes for her.  As it does so desperation\n     brings a plan to KIRSTY's head.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Wait!\n\n     He stops.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                No time for argument.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                You did this before, right?\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Many times.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                To a man called Frank Cotton?\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                Oh yes.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                But he escaped you.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Nobody escapes us.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                HE did.  I've seen him.  He's\n                alive.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Is that so?   And what are you\n                proposing?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I'll take you to him.  Then you\n                take him instead of me.  Back\n                wherever you come from.\n\n     The CENOBITE stares at her unblinking.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Perhaps ...\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                But if you cheat us ...\n\n     The sound of THE ENGINEER, scratching on the other side\n     of the wall.  The plaster cracks, violently.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                We'll tear your soul apart!\n\n     We cut back to the cracking plaster, which cracks further.\n     We hear STEVE's voice, and pan back into the room.\n\n     The door opens.   KIRSTY and the CENOBITES have gone.\n\n     STEVE is there, with the NURSE.\n\n                             STEVE\n                She was trembling all over.\n\n                             NURSE\n                I'd better go look for her.\n\n     The NURSE heads for the door.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Maybe she's gone back to her -\n\n     He looks round. The NURSE has gone.\n\n                             STEVE\n                - father.\n\n     His eyes have alighted on the box, which is lying on\n     the bed.\n\n     He picks it up.\n\n\n151  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT\n\n     Lights burn in the house, upstairs and down.\n\n\n152  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     JULIA sits in front of the dressing table mirror.\n     She has a glass of whisky in front of her.  She sips\n     from it, studying her face in the mirror.  We've seen\n     her in many moods through the story:  now we see a\n     mingling of fear and exhilaration on her face.  She gets\n     up.  Laid out on the bed is,of all things, her wedding\n     gown.\n\n\n153  INT.   STEVE'S CAR   NIGHT\n\n     STEVE drives towards Lodovico Street, scanning the streets\n     for sign of KIRSTY.\n\n\n154  EXT.   STREET   NIGHT\n\n     As his car drives past, KIRSTY turns a corner.  He does\n     not see her.   KIRSTY hurries along the street.  The\n     wind is chilly.   Sometimes she hears a bell in it.\n\n\n155  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT\n\n     STEVE drives up to the house.  The lights are still\n     burning.  He gets out of the car, and hurries down the\n     path.\n\n\n156  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n\n     He knocks on the door.  There's no reply.\n\n\n157  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     Two shadowy, naked figures stand face to face in the\n     bedroom.  We can see no detail of their features.  We\n     move down their bodies.  They are standing in a shining\n     pool of blood.\n\n\n158  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n\n     STEVE starts round the back of the house.\n\n\n159  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     The male of the couple pads towards  the bedroom door,\n     leaving a trail of blood behind him.  We can still see\n     very little of the man.\n\n\n160  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down\n     it.  The wind is strong now.  It is full of sibilant\n     whispers, hurrying her along.\n\n\n161  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT\n\n     JULIA dresses.\n\n\n162  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY reaches the doorstep.  As she does so the whispers\n     die away completely.   She beats on the door.   No reply.\n     She beats again, more urgently.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Please!   Dad!   It's me!\n                It's Kirsty!\n\n\n163  INT.   LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     JULIA steps onto the landing.  We can hear KIRSTY shouting\n     on the step.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Damn her.\n\n     We hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY?\n     Impossible to be sure.\n\n                             VOICE\n                Answer it.\n\n\n164  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY still beats on the door.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Please, answer me!  Please -\n\n     The door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Kirsty?   It's very late.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Where's Daddy?\n\n                             JULIA\n                What's the problem?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (stepping inside)\n                I have to see my father.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Of course.  There's no need to\n                shout.\n\n\n165  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     We pan across the table.  At the end of the table sits\n     LARRY.  The light is behind him.  His features are\n     shadowy.  But we can see that he is badly bruised.\n\n     We hear the womens' voices, off-screen.\n\n                             JULIA\n                You look terrible.  Have you had\n                an accident?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I was here this afternoon.\n\n                             JULIA\n                This afternoon.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I saw everything.\n\n                             JULIA\n                I'm sorry, I don't follow.\n                What was there to see?\n\n     KIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining\n     Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Oh God.  Thank God.\n                       (she starts to sob)\n                I thought something might have ...\n\n     She glances round at JULIA, who has also entered.\n                       (to Larry)\n                I have to talk to you.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Of course.\n\n     LARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over\n     the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His\n     flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck\n     and hairline.\n\n                             LARRY\n                It's all right, sweetheart.\n                Julia's told me everything;\n                and it's all right ...\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                No.  You don't understand. Your\n                brother - Frank - he's here in\n                the house.  And he's -\n\n                             LARRY\n                Whatever Frank did was his error.\n                And it's finished with now.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Finished?\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (smiles)\n                He's gone.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Gone?\n\n                             JULIA\n                Dead.\n\n                             LARRY\n                He was insane, baby:  a mad dog.\n                I put him out of his misery -\n\n     KIRSTY stares at LARRY, while in her head she hears the\n     CENOBITE's voice.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                ... we'll tear your soul apart ...\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'll go to the police, when I'm\n                feeling stronger.  Try and find\n                some way to make them understand,\n                though God knows I don't really\n                understand myself.  Did he hurt\n                you?\n\n     KIRSTY is dumb with horror at her situation.\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (leans back)\n                Poor Frank.  He's better off\n                dead.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I don't believe it.\n\n                             LARRY\n                I'm afraid it's true.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (tears in her eyes)\n                I want to see.\n\n                             LARRY\n                No you don't.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Yes!\n\n                             LARRY\n                       (to Julia)\n                Show her.\n\n     KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into\n     the Hallway.\n\n                                            CUT TO\n\n     LARRY, still sitting at the table.  His fingers drum a\n     familiar tattoo.   Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel\n     Bogey'.\n\n\n166  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     JULIA pushes open the door of the Torture Room.  It\n     creaks wide.  Lying on the floor inthe middle of the\n     room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing.\n     It steams.  There is blood everywhere.  That too, steams.\n\n     KIRSTY is revolted.  She steps away from the door, back\n     down the landing.\n\n     The bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there\n     is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds -\n     beating on the other side of the wall.\n\n     KIRSTY starts down the stairs again.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Where are you going?\n\n     KIRSTY doesn't reply.  She merely hurries away.\n\n                             JULIA\n                       (calling after\n                        her)\n                You leave this to us, you\n                hear me?   We'll deal with\n                the police -\n\n\n167  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY descends the stairs.  LARRY has stepped out of\n     the Dining Room and is moving to intercept her as she\n     makes her way to the front door.\n\n     The sound of wings, and bells - and a terrible slow\n     thunder which underpins it all - mounts in volume.\n\n     LARRY snatches at her arm.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Where are you going?\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                I have to get out.\n\n     She shrugs off his arm.   The thunder is increasing.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Stay with me -\n\n     JULIA is on the stairs, watching this exchange.\n\n                             LARRY\n                - it's all right.   Really it\n                is ...\n\n     He touches her face, fondly.\n                             KIRSTY\n                I can't stay.\n\n     She goes to the door.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Come to Daddy.\n\n     She hesitates at the door, and turns.\n\n\n168  INT.  HALLWAY   NIGHT   (KIRSTY'S P.O.V.)\n\n     The thunder fills KIRSTY's head, as she stares at LARRY,\n     who has opened his arms to her.\n\n                             LARRY\n                Come to Daddy.\n\n     Her gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No, damn you -\n\n\n169  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (mouths)\n                Oh my God.\n\n     Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder\n     fill the soundtrack.\n\n     LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have\n     begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His\n     smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails\n     rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the\n     brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears\n     slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into\n     view.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Frank!\n\n     KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in\n     the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out.\n\n     KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him\n     to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped.\n     His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior\n     of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the\n     lining.\n\n     Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair.\n\n     FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before\n     the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA\n     shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as\n     it's buried to the hilt in her side.\n\n     KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into\n     FRANK's arms.   He holds her up.\n\n     KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets\n     JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back\n     against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom\n     of the stairs.  FRANK follows.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You're not leaving now -\n\n     As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his\n     sleeve.\n\n     KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The\n     house is creaking in every board and rafter now.\n\n     FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall.,\n\n                             JULIA\n                Help me, Frank. For God's\n                sake.\n\n     He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards\n     her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that\n     he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little\n     life she has left.\n\n                             JULIA\n                No, Frank -\n\n     From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon\n     her.\n\n     Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs.\n\n     When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms.\n\n\n170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     The landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a\n     yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans.\n\n     KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one\n     of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and\n     the din of birds' wings gets louder.\n\n\n171  INT.  BIRD ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     A P.O.V. shot, lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway.\n     She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming\n     for her.\n\n\n172  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT\n\n     FRANK hears the door slam.   He drops JULIA to the\n     ground.  She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face.\n\n     FRANK starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning\n     with hunger.\n\n\n173  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY is cornered.   From below, FRANK's voice.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Where are you, beautiful?\n\n     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's\n     shadow is thrown up on the wall below.\n\n\n174  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY is faced with a choice.  The Torture Room door\n     is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead\n     she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door.\n\n\n175  INT.  JUNK ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     Moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a\n     chaos of furniture and boxes.  She crosses to the window,\n     and tries to get it open.   It won't budge.\n\n                             FRANK\n                       (somewhere below)\n                Where are you, honey?\n\n     She looks around for a lever to open the window with -\n\n\n176  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     FRANK reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door,\n     calling for her. Then he starts up the last flight of\n     stairs.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Come to Daddy.\n\n\n177  INT.  JUNK ROOM   NIGHT\n\n     KIRSTY lifts a cloth off one of the boxes.\n\n     Staring up from the box is the corpse of PRUDHOE, his\n     eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek.\n\n     She reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the\n     shadows.\n\n     An arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging\n     her back into darkness as the door opens.  FRANK stands\n     on the theshold.   His breath is thick.  He shambles\n     forward, but he doesn't see her.\n\n     We CUT back to the shadows.  KIRSTY's eyes are wild\n     with terror.\n\n     Back to the door, which clicks closed.\n\n     KIRSTY breaks cover, and so does her saviour.  It's\n     STEVE.  He is sweating with terror.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (a whisper)\n                What are you doing here?\n\n                             STEVE\n                Got in downstairs.  Looking\n                for you.  What's going on?\n\n     She shakes her head.   STEVE brings the box from his\n     jacket.\n\n                             STEVE\n                You forgot something -\n\n     She doesn't see what he's produced.  She's already\n     moving to the door.  She listens.\n\n\n178  INT.  UPPER LANDING   NIGHT\n\n     The landing is empty.   The door of the Junk Room opens.\n\n     KIRSTY steps out.\n\n     The house is strangely still.  The lights swing a little;\n     but otherwise ... nothing.  She advances along the\n     passageway.  STEVE follows.  They reach the top of the\n     stairs in safety.\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (signalled more than\n                       spoken)\n                I'll go first -\n\n     As he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room,\n     knife in hand.\n\n     Roaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself\n     out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE,\n     who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out,\n     head hitting the stairs as he descends.\n\n     The box falls from his unconscious hand.\n\n     FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife,\n     and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.\n\n\n179  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     He's after her in a flash.\n\n     She falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting\n     its skinned face.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                God -\n\n                             FRANK\n                Don't cry for him.  He's dead.\n                He always was.\n\n     KIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance.\n     She can be terrorized and pursued no longer.  Death\n     looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANK's\n     horrors.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Go on.   Kill me.  I don't care.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Poor baby.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                You bastard\n\n                             FRANK\n                Hush now.   It's all right.\n                Frank's here.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Frank.\n\n                             FRANK\n                That's right.  Are you losing\n                your mind, baby?  This is Frank\n                you're talking to.  FRANK.\n\n     As he speaks the bell begins tolling again.  FRANK looks\n     puzzled.\n\n                             FRANK\n                What's going on?\n\n     Light begins to pour through the walls of the room.\n\n                No.\n\n     He starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The\n     CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from\n     them.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                Frank -\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (to Cenobite)\n                What took you so long?\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                We had to hear it from his own\n                lips -\n\n     FRANK turns on KIRSTY.\n\n                             FRANK\n                You set me up!   You bitch.\n                You set me up!\n\n     The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate,\n     and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                       (to Kirsty)\n                This isn't for your eyes.\n\n     KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the\n     handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He\n     breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he\n     comes within striking distance the air is full of whining\n     sounds and he stops dead.\n\n     They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and\n     legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and\n     temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which\n     arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as\n     he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader\n     of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings\n     back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.\n\n                             CENOBITE\n                       (to Kirsty)\n                Out!\n\n     She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled\n     back towards the centre of the room.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Bitch!\n\n     The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as\n     KIRSTY steps onto the landing.\n\n\n180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     Behind her, FRANK howls.\n\n     She looks back.\n\n     They have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled;\n     hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He\n     fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They\n     pull the chains tighter.\n\n\n181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT\n\n     A close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting.\n     He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from\n     beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his\n     tongue over his bloodied lips.\n\n     Then -\n\n     - he comes apart.\n\n\n182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT\n\n     The door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter\n     of blood and flesh fragments.\n\n     Something heavy thuds against the door.\n\n     KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs.\n\n\n183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT\n\n     As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half-\n     lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations\n     are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and\n     his face is bruised, but he's conscious.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                We have to get out of here.\n                They'll kill us for the fun of\n                it.\n\n     STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box,\n     which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up,\n     the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                Don't leave us yet -\n\n     KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                We've got such sights to show\n                you -\n\n     KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back\n     into place.\n\n                             FEMALE CENOBITE\n                ... don't ...\n\n     Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into\n     darkness.\n\n                             STEVE\n                       (behind Kirsty)\n                Jesus Christ.\n\n     They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the\n     CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod\n     he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again,\n     KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls\n     and is claimed by the darkness.\n\n\n184  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT\n\n     They hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another\n     creature to step into their path.  Dust is falling from\n     the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up  in the\n     walls.  Any moment, surely, the whole place will be\n     destroyed.\n\n     JULIA's body has gone from the hallway;  a trail of blood\n     leads into the dining room.\n\n     As KIRSTY and STEVE stumble across the hallway, they hear\n     JULIA's voice, off-screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.\n\n                             JULIA\n                Kirsty ...\n\n     KIRSTY hesitates, and looks towards the door of the\n     dining room.\n\n     There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood,\n     her veil covering her face.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Julia?\n\n     KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the\n     veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE\n     is beneath.\n\n     KIRSTY slams the box closed.\n\n     The CENOBITE howls, and disappears.\n\n     STEVE heads for the door.  Turns the handle.\n\n     As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the\n     box unfinished.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Don't!\n\n     Too late.  He turns the handle.   The door is flung\n     open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the\n     door, swings down into the hallway.\n\n     STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box\n     falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at\n     STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY\n     in the front line.\n\n     The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now\n     uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her,\n     its legs still bracing it in the door.\n\n     She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth\n     oozing fluids, almost catches her arm.\n\n     Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold\n     of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws.\n\n     Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and\n     flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily\n     relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its\n     hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her fingers.\n     The box defies her manipulations.\n\n                             STEVE\n                Come on!   Come on!\n\n     THE ENGINEER crawls towards them.  Up above, the din\n     of the roof collapsing.  Timbers and dust hurtle down\n     the stairs.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                Shit.  Shit.  Shit.\n\n     THE ENGINEER is almost upon her.  It rears up, its saliva\n     dropping on her.\n\n     And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into\n     place.\n \n     The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes\n     THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out\n     into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears.\n\n     Its voice grows thin, and fades.\n\n     Finally, silence.\n\n     The house is still.\n\n     KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same.\n\n     Together, they move to the door, and out onto the\n     step.\n\n\n185  EXT.  DOORSTEP   NIGHT\n\n     The door slams behind them, of its own accord.\n\n     KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand.\n\n     There is a slit in it which has not quite closed.  Light\n     suddenly pours from it, up into KIRSTY's face.  Her\n     features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards\n     the box.  From within:  shrieks, bells, music.\n\n     Between the screams, FRANK's voice.\n\n                             FRANK\n                Come to Daddy!\n\n     She slams the panel shut.  The distortions cease. So\n     does the din.\n\n                             KIRSTY\n                       (quietly)\n                Not tonight.\n\n     A smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep,\n     making her way towards the street.  STEVE gazes at her,\n     then follows.\n\n     Their figures are erased by the darkness.\n\n     Somewhere, a bell rings as ...\n\n     THE CREDITS ROLL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHellraiser\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Clive Barker\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:47.851460"}
