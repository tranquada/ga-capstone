Somewhere, someone is\r\n          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.\r\n          He meets them all with--\r\n\r\n                         GUARD\r\n          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands\r\n          off the bars!\r\n\r\n          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,\r\n          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --\r\n          home of the scum of the scum.\r\n          Meanwhile...\r\n\r\n          PRISON VISITING ROOM\r\n\r\n          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read\r\n          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which\r\n          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do\r\n          their jobs.\r\n\r\n          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time\r\n          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their\r\n          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:\r\n          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if\r\n          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to\r\n          life.\r\n\r\n          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake\r\n          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 2\r\n          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I\r\n          guess even a turd gets flies to\r\n          land on it.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 3\r\n          Me, I like a big girl.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,\r\n          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at\r\n          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 2\r\n          I.D., visitation papers.\r\n\r\n          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD\r\n          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most\r\n          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a\r\n          code.\r\n          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it\r\n          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this\r\n          thing must've done something REAL bad.\r\n\r\n          WITH DEVIL GIRL\r\n          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security\r\n          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough\r\n          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the\r\n          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 3\r\n          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but\r\n          you know.\r\n          They laugh, buzz her through.\r\n\r\n          WITH THE GUARD\r\n          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the\r\n          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:\r\n\r\n                         GUARD\r\n          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.\r\n          Let's go, pretty boy.\r\n\r\n                         VISITING ROOM\r\n          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured\r\n          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face\r\n          of a guard.\r\n          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks\r\n          like they're not taking chances.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She\r\n          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER\r\n\r\n                         BELOVED --\r\n          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A\r\n          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a\r\n          grubby unshaven face...\r\n          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --\r\n          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the\r\n          way Elvis was in his prime.\r\n          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on\r\n          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.\r\n          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and\r\n          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl\r\n          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.\r\n          A guard pokes them with his billy club --\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 2\r\n          This ain't a conjugal visit.\r\n          quit yer conjugating.\r\n\r\n                         YAZ\r\n          When's the last time you conjugated\r\n          anything?\r\n\r\n                         DEVIL GIRL\r\n          I brought you a cake.\r\n\r\n                         YAZ\r\n          Thanks, darling.\r\n\r\n                         (TO GUARDS)\r\n          Hey could you cut this up for us?\r\n          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic\r\n          like that.\r\n          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-\r\n          fingered scoop of frosting.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD 2\r\n\r\n                         (MOUTH FULL)\r\n          Not great.

PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR\r\n\r\n          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down\r\n          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --\r\n          stops and smiles.\r\n\r\n          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING\r\n          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille\r\n          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.\r\n          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,\r\n          completing the look.\r\n          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at\r\n          by the guy who must be \"The Big Man\" Jay HONKS and waves --\r\n          thank you!\r\n          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a\r\n          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.\r\n          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' \"Can't Get Next to You\"\r\n          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is\r\n\r\n          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.\r\n          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian\r\n          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman\r\n          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.\r\n          He smiles and leans towards them.\r\n\r\n                         JAY\r\n          Guess what?

MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING\r\n\r\n          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.\r\n          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.\r\n          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to\r\n          the guard... nothing. From behind him:\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          Help you?
