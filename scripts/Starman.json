HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly \n               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack \n               lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a \n               dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center \n               of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the \n               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.\n\n<b>               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back \n               seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two \n               regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                              (an edge of fear in \n                              his voice)\n                         It's coming up...

HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and \n               starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed \n               for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by \n               the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.\n\n<b>               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a \n               cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the \n               fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard \n               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                              (startled)\n                         Benny, God, take it easy...\n\n<b>                                     BENNY (GUARD)\n</b>                         I don't want to scare them away.\n\n               The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the \n               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.\n\n<b>               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men \n               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.\n\n<b>                                     SECOND OFFICER\n</b>                         Smells smoke...\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         I told you.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. \n               Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a \n               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The \n               men get out of the car.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                              (loud whisper)\n                         There!! Up on the hill!!\n\n               The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on \n               his shoulder.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         Right in line with that burning tree.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         I don't see anything.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         It's there. The fog's thicker now, \n                         but it's there. What do you think \n                         started those fires?\n\n               The officer strains to see through the fog.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         Benny, there's nothing there.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         There is. They came out of the belly \n                         of the ship and then went to the \n                         first terrace and flew down into the \n                         houses.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         Flew?!

What \n               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among \n               the houses below them. Further into the track another beam \n               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise \n               stationary.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         What did I tell you?\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         Probably kids.\n\n               One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other \n               side.\n\n<b>                                     MIKE\n</b>                              (not convinced)\n                         Probably...\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away \n               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police \n               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running \n               lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a \n               red tint.\n\n<b>               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's \n               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         Don't you think you should call a \n                         backup?\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         No, we can handle this.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is \n               on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills \n               over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we \n               hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly \n               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the \n               houses.\n\n<b>               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture \n               window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The \n               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises \n               a hand to eye level. There is a sharp \"SNAP\" and a hard-edged \n               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside \n               of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of \n               stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the \n               silhouette.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. \n               Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches \n               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the \n               direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight \n               swings onto the house.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                              (over outside speakers)\n                         This is the police. Identify \n                         yourselves.\n\n               It is deathly silent.\n\n               Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan \n               out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across \n               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.\n\n               The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each \n               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing \n               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in \n               and out of visual contact with each other.\n\n               Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle \n               sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the \n               ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light \n               pointing at a cement mixer.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                              (to the officers, his \n                              voice cracking)\n                         There's one over here...\n\n               The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands \n               trembling, raises the gun.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         Stop!! Police!!\n\n               The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple \n               shots. The light goes out immediately.\n\n<b>                                     MIKE\n</b>                              (in Benny's direction)\n                         What happened?\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         I think I shot one.\n\n<b>                                     MIKE\n</b>                         Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?\n\n<b>               INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses \n               to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog \n               outlines him.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The men strain to see something through the silent fog.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         You see anything, Mike?\n\n               Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound \n               is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and \n               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         This is the police. Identify \n                         yourselves.\n\n               Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of \n               him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He \n               gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light \n               searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. \n               Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. \n               Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                              (shouts to the officers)\n                         You wanna give me some help over \n                         here.\n\n<b>                                     MIKE\n</b>                         Okay...\n\n               Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into \n               a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a \n               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then \n               raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing \n               off its wrist into its hands.\n\n               At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. \n               The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around \n               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny \n               screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a \n               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest \n               and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder \n               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the \n               houses.\n\n               The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the \n               air, then crashes to the earth.\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                         Mike, call for back-up.\n                              (shouting)\n                         Benny, you all right?\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         I don't think so...\n                              (clutching his shoulder)\n\n<b>                                     OFFICER\n</b>                              (waving the beam of \n                              his flashlight, shouts)\n                         Benny, this is me. I'm going to take \n                         a look.\n\n               Benny's beam flashes back.\n\n<b>                                     BENNY\n</b>                         Don't leave me. I'm coming.\n\n               The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly \n               around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts \n               to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break \n               into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light \n               in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and \n               lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny \n               and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they \n               might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down \n               on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets \n               over their heads.

They \n               are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming \n               up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for \n               them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises \n               his shotgun and fires wildly at it.

Do you hear me?\n\n               The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he \n               presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and \n               concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field \n               pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized \n               aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A \n               green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red \n               dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his \n               hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass \n               remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long \n               moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that \n               disappears when his palms come together.\n\n<b>               INT.

WOODS - DAY\n</b>\n               The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal \n               in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning \n               rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to \n               a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves \n               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, \n               Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are \n               of particular interest to him.\n\n               When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get \n               a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts \n               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a \n               grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to \n               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.\n\n               Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his \n               search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a \n               Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the \n               driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a \n               Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a \n               pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely \n               lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female \n               voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.\n\n<b>                                     VOICES\n</b>                         It was great to have you back...

HILLSIDE - DAY\n</b>\n               The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light \n               plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut \n               off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip \n               of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he \n               sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.\n\n               Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The \n               boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is \n               disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN \n               crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, \n               he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the \n               highway.\n\n<b>               EXT.

It \n               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches \n               the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his \n               faceplate and speaks into it.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                              (subtitles)\n                         Iron channel message.

The two words 'We \n               have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have \n               automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have \n               financing...' ...\n\n               We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                              (practicing the human \n                              sound)\n                         Wehave...\n                              (more precise)\n                         Wehave...\n                              (well-formed)\n                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the \n               clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads \n               upstairs. Half way up she stops.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                              (faint through the \n                              glass)\n                         Damn!\n\n               She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries \n               upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs \n               away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his \n               way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping \n               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair \n               of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning \n               the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. \n               The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny \n               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against \n               the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes \n               back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer \n               in the shadows.\n\n<b>               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the \n               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN \n               steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches \n               in Jenny's throat.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                              (precise)\n                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway \n               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an \n               end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny \n               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR \n               MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three \n               inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the \n               chain holds.\n\n               The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab \n               her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the \n               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on \n               inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins \n               to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a \n               mittened hand over her mouth.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN \n               takes his hand away from her mouth.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                         Please don't hurt me... please... \n                         please.\n\n               Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and \n               lifts it up to look at it.\n\n               He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between \n               his thumb and forefinger.\n\n               Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at \n               him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she \n               hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she \n               sprints up the stairs.\n\n               The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.\n\n<b>               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams \n               the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE \n               OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging \n               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.\n\n               The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. \n               When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, \n               but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the \n               sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                              (hysteria creeping \n                              into her voice)\n                         It's got to be here... it's got to \n                         be here...\n\n               She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue \n               .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with \n               a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night \n               table next to the bed.\n\n               Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the \n               \"BLEET\" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long \n               in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to \n               sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can \n               HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's \n               indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she \n               waits.\n\n               Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and \n               opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off \n               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She \n               looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides \n               to go downstairs.\n\n<b>               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along \n               the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a \n               hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The \n               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.\n\n               The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back \n               to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his \n               head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to \n               tell exactly what is going on.\n\n               Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room \n               for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns \n               to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is \n               holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his \n               mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.\n\n               The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR \n               MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is \n               already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny \n               begins to tremble and lowers the gun.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                              (in a small voice)\n                         No... please don't...\n\n               She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned \n               out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, \n               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and \n               takes the gun from her.\n\n               He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of \n               the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE \n               WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside \n               next to the back yard.\n\n               The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his \n               transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward \n               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over \n               the entire body.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at \n               himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and \n               a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button \n               in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an \n               innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his \n               chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. \n               He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but \n               are noticeably more precise.\n\n               The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect \n               his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his \n               eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides \n               of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind \n               them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to \n               see if it is on securely.\n\n               He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and \n               a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed \n               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. \n               In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is \n               now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking \n               to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions \n               for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR \n               MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her \n               to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She \n               looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar \n               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                         Please...\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                         Don't... don't do this... please...\n\n               The STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the \n               room.

Topping a knoll straight \n               ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign revolving \n               above it.

She slams the \n               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' \n               room.

Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused \n               for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It \n               means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' \n               room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN \n               stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child \n               waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the \n               Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the \n               dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the \n               gallons and the cost of the gas.\n\n               Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light \n               cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc \n               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of \n               light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. \n               The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR \n               MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.\n\n               The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up \n               the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his \n               feet.\n\n               He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece \n               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space \n               traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better \n               look and mutters something to himself in his language. The \n               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings \n               himself stiffly out of the seat.\n\n<b>                                     RIDER\n</b>                         Do I need a key for the head?\n\n<b>                                     ATTENDANT\n</b>                         It's open.\n\n               Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the \n               men's room.\n\n<b>                                     RIDER\n</b>                              (over his shoulder)\n                         Fill it up.\n\n<b>                                     ATTENDANT\n</b>                         You got it.\n\n               The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to \n               the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He \n               tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly \n               out of his pocket.\n\n<b>               INT.

The LOUD THWACK it makes when it \n               hits the cement turns faces in his direction.\n\n               Jenny's is not among them.

The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN \n               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the \n               floor.

One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his \n               right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a \n               blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys.

This cuts \n               off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't \n               have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars \n               on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to \n               lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.\n\n<b>               INT.

The \n               STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto \n               the shoulder and into a ditch.\n\n               The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol \n               car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a \n               sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.\n\n<b>               EXT.

His headlights \n               pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto \n               it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting \n               across the highway after him.\n\n<b>               EXT.

It is locked.\n\n               When he turns back to the car, he sees something that \n               frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A \n               helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to \n               hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other \n               side of the gate offers the only protection.\n\n               The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in \n               her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his \n               shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, \n               wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the \n               trees.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He moves through the underbrush toward it. \n               Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. \n               He struggles to regain his balance.\n\n               When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING \n               RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a \n               few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a \n               flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. \n               Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.\n\n               From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over \n               the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the \n               treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and \n               the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts \n               his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction \n               from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He sees that their guns are drawn and \n               pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes \n               a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR \n               MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of \n               a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and \n               EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police.

He massages the golden orb until it \n               becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps \n               to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.\n\n<b>               EXT.

With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes \n               away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He \n               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in \n               her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the \n               glow of his brain through his human skin.\n\n               A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles \n               across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR \n               MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly \n               for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been \n               closed without a scar.\n\n               A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's \n               left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, \n               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends \n               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, \n               they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under \n               the skin.\n\n               Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the \n               STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around \n               something in the highway.\n\n               When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the \n               blood off Jenny's shoulder.

HALF HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               Jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a \n               sloppy DOWNSHIFT JOLTS the house. Her eyes flutter open and \n               she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. \n               The truck leans into the turn. Jenny braces herself on one \n               arm and sits up.\n\n               Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she \n               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. She \n               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder \n               and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows \n               she sustained. She has been completely healed and there are \n               no scars. She leans forward and looks down the hallway.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                         Hello... hello.\n\n               The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she \n               gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, \n               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she \n               sees the blood and bullet holes.\n\n               Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed \n               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning \n               stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the \n               sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                         Hello.

It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She \n               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing \n               what to do next.

She is \n               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a \n               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She \n               steps back from the window to examine it, then with some \n               trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her \n               finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Jennyhay...\n\n               Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's \n               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across \n               the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent \n               enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble \n               making herself approach it.\n\n               When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it \n               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing \n               her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR \n               MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         ...nd.

But the damned \n                         inflation's driven the tuition up so \n                         high it makes it real tough on a \n                         family like ours.\n\n               The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke \n               at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then \n               chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries \n               to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his \n               struggles.\n\n<b>                                     COOK\n</b>                         I got two other kids.

But I \n                         think a lot of people are just using \n                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of \n                         us off.

As if etiquette required it, \n               the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill \n               effects.\n\n<b>                                     COOK\n</b>                         Do you have children?\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                         No.\n\n<b>                                     COOK\n</b>                         They're damned expensive and a pain \n                         in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't \n                         trade having them for anything.\n\n               The Cook flicks his ash out of the window.

The STAR \n               MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner \n               plunges by her.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b><b>                         JENNYHAYDN!!!\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A \n               truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into \n               the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet \n               him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it \n               swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center \n               divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head \n               against his chest.

With Jenny watching we have a montage \n               of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the \n               insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid-\n               section above the trigger, fitting electrical components \n               into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding \n               it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical \n               wires.\n\n<b>               INT.

The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from \n               the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into \n               the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates \n               around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra \n               is still sitting next to the road.\n\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                              (glancing at the \n                              modified drill)\n                         I hope that works.\n\n               The STAR MAN is lost in concentration.\n\n               Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. \n               Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF \n               SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN \n               leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly \n               scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The \n               concussion throws the men to the ground.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He \n               presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged \n               foothills.\n\n               The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind \n               them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING \n               WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for \n               its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a \n               moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN \n<b>               IT FADES.\n</b>\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                         If my ship is not here, we are in \n                         trouble.\n\n               This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she \n               flexes her fingers on the wheel.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                              (points at a \n                              distinctive cone \n                              peak)\n                         That's where we landed last time. \n                         Right under that mountain.\n\n               Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of \n               their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA \n               dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight \n               bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE \n               GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.\n\n               Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP \n               the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A \n               SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its \n               MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.\n\n               The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in \n               the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next \n               FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have \n               been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.\n\n<b>               INT.

The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot \n               metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred \n               out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND \n               on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS \n<b>               THEM OUT OF THE SKY.\n</b>\n<b>                                     JENNY\n</b>                         In front!!!

She supports him as they \n               struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra \n               roars over the hill.\n\n<b>               INT.

The searchlight \n               from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise \n               puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm \n               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The \n               STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.\n\n<b>                                     STAR MAN\n</b>                              (gasps)\n                         I can't shoot anymore.\n\n               Jenny looks out between the crags.

With their searchlights flicking \n               over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. \n               Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN.
