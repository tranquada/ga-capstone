HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly \n               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack \n               lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a \n               dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center \n               of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the \n               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.\n\n               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n               A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back \n               seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two \n               regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                              (an edge of fear in \n                              his voice)\n                         It's coming up... Slow down...\n                              (he points out between \n                              them)\n                         There, right there...\n\n               Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a \n               billboard announcing a 'new' housing development.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and \n               starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed \n               for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by \n               the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.\n\n               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n               The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a \n               cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the \n               fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard \n               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                              (startled)\n                         Benny, God, take it easy...\n\n                                     BENNY (GUARD)\n                         I don't want to scare them away.\n\n               The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the \n               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.\n\n               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n               The windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men \n               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.\n\n                                     SECOND OFFICER\n                         Smells smoke...\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         I told you.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. \n               Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a \n               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The \n               men get out of the car.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                              (loud whisper)\n                         There!! Up on the hill!!\n\n               The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on \n               his shoulder.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         Right in line with that burning tree.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         I don't see anything.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         It's there. The fog's thicker now, \n                         but it's there. What do you think \n                         started those fires?\n\n               The officer strains to see through the fog.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Benny, there's nothing there.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         There is. They came out of the belly \n                         of the ship and then went to the \n                         first terrace and flew down into the \n                         houses.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...\n\n               The second officer is peering intently at something down \n               among the houses.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling \n                         us...\n\n                                     MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)\n                         What's that?\n\n               Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What \n               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among \n               the houses below them. Further into the track another beam \n               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise \n               stationary.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         What did I tell you?\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Probably kids.\n\n               One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other \n               side.\n\n                                     MIKE\n                              (not convinced)\n                         Probably...\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away \n               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police \n               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running \n               lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a \n               red tint.\n\n               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n               The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's \n               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         Don't you think you should call a \n                         backup?\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         No, we can handle this.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is \n               on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills \n               over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we \n               hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly \n               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the \n               houses.\n\n               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture \n               window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The \n               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises \n               a hand to eye level. There is a sharp \"SNAP\" and a hard-edged \n               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside \n               of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of \n               stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the \n               silhouette.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. \n               Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches \n               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the \n               direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight \n               swings onto the house.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                              (over outside speakers)\n                         This is the police. Identify \n                         yourselves.\n\n               It is deathly silent.\n\n               Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan \n               out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across \n               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.\n\n               The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each \n               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing \n               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in \n               and out of visual contact with each other.\n\n               Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle \n               sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the \n               ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light \n               pointing at a cement mixer.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                              (to the officers, his \n                              voice cracking)\n                         There's one over here...\n\n               The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands \n               trembling, raises the gun.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         Stop!! Police!!\n\n               The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple \n               shots. The light goes out immediately.\n\n                                     MIKE\n                              (in Benny's direction)\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         I think I shot one.\n\n                                     MIKE\n                         Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?\n\n               INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT\n\n               We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses \n               to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog \n               outlines him.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               The men strain to see something through the silent fog.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         You see anything, Mike?\n\n               Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound \n               is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and \n               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         This is the police. Identify \n                         yourselves.\n\n               Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of \n               him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He \n               gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light \n               searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. \n               Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. \n               Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                              (shouts to the officers)\n                         You wanna give me some help over \n                         here.\n\n                                     MIKE\n                         Okay...\n\n               Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into \n               a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a \n               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then \n               raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing \n               off its wrist into its hands.\n\n               At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. \n               The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around \n               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny \n               screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a \n               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest \n               and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder \n               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the \n               houses.\n\n               The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the \n               air, then crashes to the earth.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Mike, call for back-up.\n                              (shouting)\n                         Benny, you all right?\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         I don't think so...\n                              (clutching his shoulder)\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                              (waving the beam of \n                              his flashlight, shouts)\n                         Benny, this is me. I'm going to take \n                         a look.\n\n               Benny's beam flashes back.\n\n                                     BENNY\n                         Don't leave me. I'm coming.\n\n               The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly \n               around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts \n               to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break \n               into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light \n               in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and \n               lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny \n               and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they \n               might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down \n               on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets \n               over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. \n               As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple \n               to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting \n               at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble \n               the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.\n\n               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the \n               kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its \n               faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive \n               language. Through the window over the sink we can see the \n               lights of the spaceship.\n\n               The rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is \n               airborne out the open back door.\n\n               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT\n\n               From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid \n               figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees \n               and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the \n               spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening \n               as it begins to rise above the trees.\n\n               With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights \n               flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to \n               a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they \n               jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the \n               super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They \n               are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming \n               up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for \n               them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises \n               his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and \n               disappears into the fog.\n\n               With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity \n               and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock \n               Benny and the officers off their feet.\n\n               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree \n               height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets.

By the faint \n               identification light that flickers on and off inside its \n               helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent \n               coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and \n               threatens to suffocate him.\n\n               Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend \n               from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. \n               He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent \n               eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that \n               delineate his mouth are chalk-white.\n\n               He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too \n               weak.

Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the \n               top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout \n               the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses \n               into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.\n\n               INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK\n\n               A light rain is falling.\n\n               We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape \n               passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man \n               in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his \n               attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. \n               Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract \n               is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking \n               turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into \n               view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over \n               the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air \n               Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn.\n\n               EXT.

The three men \n               are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage \n               across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending \n               helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear \n               inside.\n\n               Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose \n               door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his \n               contamination suit, comes down the ladder.

He parts the \n               tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent \n               body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow \n               ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and \n               his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick \n               inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his \n               knees and stands up.\n\n               INT.

The extraterrestrial is still on its \n               back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that \n               extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction-\n               sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making \n               adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is \n               monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. \n               Both are wearing contamination suits.\n\n               A foam-lined coffin-shaped metal box is on the ground next \n               to one of the walls. Bell and Shermin approach the body. \n               Shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see \n               is his own reflection.

He angles it at the \n               faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of \n               the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through \n               and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw \n               themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, \n               distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect \n               on the glass of their contamination hoods.

When he pulls them apart, a blue force field \n               pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized \n               aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A \n               green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red \n               dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his \n               hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass \n               remains floating in the air in front of him.

WOODS - DAY\n\n               The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal \n               in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning \n               rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to \n               a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves \n               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, \n               Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are \n               of particular interest to him.\n\n               When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get \n               a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts \n               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a \n               grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to \n               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.\n\n               Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his \n               search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a \n               Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the \n               driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a \n               Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a \n               pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely \n               lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female \n               voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.\n\n                                     VOICES\n                         It was great to have you back...

With the Volvo moving away up the \n               street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into \n               the house.\n\n               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY\n\n               The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light \n               plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut \n               off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip \n               of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he \n               sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.\n\n               Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The \n               boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is \n               disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN \n               crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, \n               he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the \n               highway.\n\n               EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are \n               reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny \n               push a hand mower over her back yard.\n\n               He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while \n               Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It \n               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches \n               the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his \n               faceplate and speaks into it.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (subtitles)\n                         Iron channel message.

HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               We are looking through the living room window at Jenny \n               watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to \n               wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the \n               light-fall in the back yard watching her.\n\n               A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN \n               in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We \n               have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have \n               automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have \n               financing...' ...\n\n               We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (practicing the human \n                              sound)\n                         Wehave...\n                              (more precise)\n                         Wehave...\n                              (well-formed)\n                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the \n               clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads \n               upstairs. Half way up she stops.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (faint through the \n                              glass)\n                         Damn!\n\n               She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries \n               upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs \n               away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his \n               way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping \n               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair \n               of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning \n               the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. \n               The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny \n               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against \n               the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes \n               back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer \n               in the shadows.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the \n               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN \n               steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches \n               in Jenny's throat.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (precise)\n                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway \n               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an \n               end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny \n               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR \n               MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three \n               inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the \n               chain holds.\n\n               The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab \n               her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the \n               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on \n               inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins \n               to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a \n               mittened hand over her mouth.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Wehave...\n\n               Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN \n               takes his hand away from her mouth.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Please don't hurt me... please... \n                         please.\n\n               Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and \n               lifts it up to look at it.\n\n               He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between \n               his thumb and forefinger.\n\n               Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at \n               him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she \n               hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she \n               sprints up the stairs.\n\n               The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams \n               the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE \n               OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging \n               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.\n\n               The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. \n               When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, \n               but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the \n               sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (hysteria creeping \n                              into her voice)\n                         It's got to be here... it's got to \n                         be here...\n\n               She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue \n               .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with \n               a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night \n               table next to the bed.\n\n               Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the \n               \"BLEET\" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long \n               in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to \n               sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can \n               HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's \n               indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she \n               waits.\n\n               Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and \n               opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off \n               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She \n               looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides \n               to go downstairs.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along \n               the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a \n               hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The \n               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.\n\n               The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back \n               to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his \n               head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to \n               tell exactly what is going on.\n\n               Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room \n               for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns \n               to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is \n               holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his \n               mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.\n\n               The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR \n               MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is \n               already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny \n               begins to tremble and lowers the gun.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (in a small voice)\n                         No... please don't...\n\n               She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned \n               out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, \n               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and \n               takes the gun from her.\n\n               He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of \n               the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE \n               WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside \n               next to the back yard.\n\n               The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his \n               transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward \n               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over \n               the entire body.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

We think, \n                         and this is just speculation, that \n                         some form of energy flows from the \n                         brain, which is much more \n                         sophisticated than ours, throughout \n                         the rest of the body...

JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK\n\n               Jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her \n               knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the \n               closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at \n               himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and \n               a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button \n               in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an \n               innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his \n               chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. \n               He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but \n               are noticeably more precise.\n\n               The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect \n               his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his \n               eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides \n               of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind \n               them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to \n               see if it is on securely.\n\n               He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and \n               a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed \n               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. \n               In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is \n               now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking \n               to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions \n               for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR \n               MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her \n               to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She \n               looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar \n               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Please...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Don't... don't do this... please...\n\n               The STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the \n               room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the \n               STAR MAN has become is her husband.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK\n\n               The STAR MAN pulls Jenny down the stairs.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (struggles to free \n                              herself)\n                         You're hurting me. Stop.\n\n               The STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for \n               the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases \n               her struggle and manages to pull away.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this \n                         house with you. You're going to hurt \n                         me, I know...\n\n               The STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front \n               door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the \n               dawn outside.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (through tears)\n                         I can't. I'd like to help. You look \n                         like Scott, but I know you're not. I \n                         don't know what you are. You gotta \n                         understand, I'm afraid of you...\n\n               As Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the \n               door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his \n               finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Please.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Why are you doing this to me? I'll \n                         give you whatever...\n\n               The STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body \n               and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the \n               remains, then back to the STAR MAN.\n\n               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK\n\n               The Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind \n               the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger \n               seat.\n\n               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK\n\n               Wary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny \n               move the gear selector to the drive position.\n\n               The car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep \n               from toppling back in the seat.\n\n               During the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to \n               side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape \n               as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at \n               Jenny questioningly.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Please...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Which way do you want to go?\n\n               She motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section \n               with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes \n               question Jenny again.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You can go that way...\n                              (points left)\n                         That way...\n                              (straight ahead)\n                         That way...\n\n               She points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN \n               presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, \n               then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between \n               them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates \n               until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his \n               hands and points to the right.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (measured)\n                         That way.\n\n               The satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (staring incredulously \n                              at the compass)\n                         God, what are you?\n\n               She starts her right turn without looking left and fails to \n               see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF \n               THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the \n               brakes.\n\n               The Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny \n               checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the \n               passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They \n               both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (starting the engine)\n                         I'm sorry...\n\n               This time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN \n               is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn \n               and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it \n               from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it \n               is: an aerial view of the United States.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         That green dot, that's us, isn't \n                         it... and the red's where you want \n                         to go?... You don't understand me, \n                         do you?\n\n               The STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (to herself)\n                         I gotta get out of here.\n\n               EXT.

MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK\n\n               The STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights \n               rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to \n               follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on \n               her face.\n\n               When she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a \n               glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away \n               her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes \n               a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in \n               his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (startled)\n                         What?\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (thinking the steering \n                              wheel is called \n                              'what,\" he repeats)\n                         What.\n\n               With the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear \n               shift.'\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (realizing her mistake)\n                         Ah... no...\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (repeats)\n                         Ah no.\n\n               He points to the dashboard.

MUSTANG - AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN'S hand closes around the butt of the .45 when \n               he sees the ATTENDANT step out of the office.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Who?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Attendant.

Fill her up?\n\n               The STAR MAN looks at Jenny for help. She sweeps her fingers \n               across her mouth to indicate her lips are sealed. The STAR \n               MAN peeks around her at the Attendant.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (overly loud)\n                         ...Gas...\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         You got it.\n\n               He leaves the window. The STAR MAN watches him until the \n               nozzle is in the Mustang, then pleased with himself, turns \n               to Jenny and lifts his face into a 'smile.'\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I'm going to the ladies' room.

When she straightens up, she finds \n               the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the \n               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' \n               room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN \n               trots after her.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (wheels on him as he \n                              catches up)\n                         Go back to the car.\n\n               The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in \n               frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to \n               the ladies' room and throws open the door.\n\n               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying \n                         to escape. I just have to go to the \n                         bathroom.\n\n               He checks out the stall.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Satisfied? Now get out. Out.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         No.\n\n               Furious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points \n               to the sign on it.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Women... me.\n\n               She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her.\n\n               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON\n\n               Jenny points to the sign on the next door.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Men. You go in here.\n\n               She cracks the door for him.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Come on.\n\n               He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look \n               inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused \n               for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It \n               means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' \n               room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN \n               stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child \n               waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the \n               Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the \n               dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the \n               gallons and the cost of the gas.\n\n               Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light \n               cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc \n               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of \n               light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. \n               The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR \n               MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.\n\n               The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up \n               the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his \n               feet.\n\n               He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece \n               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space \n               traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better \n               look and mutters something to himself in his language. The \n               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings \n               himself stiffly out of the seat.\n\n                                     RIDER\n                         Do I need a key for the head?\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         It's open.\n\n               Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the \n               men's room.\n\n                                     RIDER\n                              (over his shoulder)\n                         Fill it up.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         You got it.\n\n               The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to \n               the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He \n               tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly \n               out of his pocket.\n\n               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\n               Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the \n               corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at \n               the doorknob. It holds.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Just a minute.\n\n               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes \n               in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.\n\n                                     RIDER\n                         Howdy... can't get her out.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (thru the smile)\n                         Gas.\n\n                                     RIDER\n                         I know how she feels.\n\n               The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind \n               him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on \n               the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He \n               blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.\n\n               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is \n               happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is \n               pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. \n               The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED \n               GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (stepping around him)\n                         It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a \n                         ballroom.\n\n               She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against \n               the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps \n               forward to read.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...\n\n               Jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (on her way out)\n                         That's very good.\n\n               Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's \n               message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at \n               it, he follows her.\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON\n\n               A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser. \n               Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her \n               shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter \n               disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out \n               of her purse, he points to it.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Money.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Yes.\n\n               She inserts the quarter and makes her selection.

The light above the \n               intersection ahead turns red and, even though he is still \n               fiddling with the wipers, the STAR MAN manages a smooth stop \n               back of the crosswalk.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (indicating the red \n                              dot on the satel \n                              compass)\n                         Why are you going here?

The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks \n               his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. \n               The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws \n               open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, \n               she is out and running.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Jennyhaydn!\n\n               He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car \n               lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the \n               wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the \n               other car waiting at the light.\n\n               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY\n\n               Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She \n               dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. \n               The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps \n               out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of \n               pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and \n               zigzags through the people in that direction.\n\n               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY\n\n               As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of \n               Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Hey!!\n\n               In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people \n               to look in the shops that border the atrium.\n\n               MEZZANINE\n\n               Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below \n               her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away \n               and gets on the escalator to the second floor.\n\n               ON THE GROUND FLOOR\n\n               The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, \n               but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. \n               Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board \n               advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it \n               hits the cement turns faces in his direction.\n\n               Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. \n               Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He \n               spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in \n               view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram.\n\n               It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN \n               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the \n               floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER \n               comes charging out of a plant store.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! \n                         Burt!!\n\n               The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her.\n\n               She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was \n                         stealing my baby!!\n\n               Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR \n               MAN's way to the escalator.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Where you think you're going?\n\n               Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They \n               push him back.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Please.\n\n               A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to \n               the Mother.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         He was trying to steal Gloria.\n\n               Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around.\n\n                                     BURT\n                         Is that right? Huh?\n\n               He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (stutters)\n                         Please.\n\n               Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes \n               him.\n\n                                     BURT\n                         Is that right? Come on. Answer me.\n\n               Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he \n               begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even \n               madder.\n\n                                     BURT\n                         Were you trying to steal my baby? \n                         Huh? Answer me!\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Jennyhaydn!\n\n               SECOND FLOOR\n\n               Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor \n               when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she \n               gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she \n               can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs \n               Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the \n               mob.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Jennyhaydn!\n\n               One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch \n               him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.\n\n               GROUND FLOOR\n\n               Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to \n               bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the \n               STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his \n               windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his \n               right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a \n               blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip \n               on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers \n               close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.\n\n                                     JENNY (O.S.)\n                         Stop it!!! Stop it!!!\n\n               She barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away \n               from the STAR MAN.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Get away from him!!

Get away from \n                         him!!\n\n               The men do. Jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind-breaker \n               back up on the STAR MAN's shoulder.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         He was stealing my baby...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You're wrong!!

They pass a \n               MALL GUARD who has just arrived.\n\n               EXT.

Jenny realizes that it is \n               comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him \n               like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (as Jenny puts him in \n                              the passenger seat)\n                         Thank you.\n\n               The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches \n               them drive off.

His \n               singing is like nothing we have ever heard. Vibrations of \n               tones and glottal stops blend into a haunting, seductive \n               fugue.

INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT\n\n               With the STAR MAN's SERENADE WAFTING over the Nebraska plains, \n               we FALL BACK TO FIND a Highway Patrol car tagging along at a \n               safe distance behind the Mustang.\n\n               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He \n               and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them, \n               three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp. \n               The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the \n               motel parking lot at the far end.\n\n               The middle car goes straight across the intersection and \n               positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving \n               access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The \n               last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks \n               in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.\n\n               INT. OFFICE - BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               In answer to Jenny's bell, the night CLERK comes out of the \n               living quarters in the back, finger combing his sleep-rumpled \n               hair.\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         What can I do for you folks?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         How much are your rooms?\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         Thirty-seven fifty for one person, \n                         forty-nine fifty for two.\n\n               Drawn by the bright colors on their covers, the STAR MAN \n               wanders over to the magazine rack. By chance, he selects a \n               copy of 'Playgirl' and begins to look through it.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You have one with two beds?\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         Sure.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I'll take that.\n\n                                     CLERK\n                              (slides her a \n                              registration card)\n                         Fill this out.\n                              (as Jenny writes)\n                         Will this be cash or credit card?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Credit card.\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         I'll have to run your card off now.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (digging through her \n                              purse)\n                         We're only going to be here a few \n                         hours...\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         It's still the full price.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Jenny, look...\n\n               From behind the STAR MAN, we WATCH Jenny react to the open \n               Playgirl centerfold that he is holding up.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Put that back.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         But I have never seen this before.

Jenny hands the smirking Clerk her credit card. He steps \n               to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. Out of the \n               corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the STAR \n               MAN's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his \n               trousers.\n\n               The Clerk glances over at Jenny to see if she hears the \n               HISSING that is going on behind the STAR MAN's fly. She does \n               and she hopes it'll stop soon. His eyes on the STAR MAN, the \n               Clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.\n\n                                     CLERK\n                         You can park your car in front of \n                         the room.\n\n               He drops the key on the counter.\n\n               INT.

This cuts \n               off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't \n               have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars \n               on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to \n               lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.\n\n               INT.

The \n               STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto \n               the shoulder and into a ditch.\n\n               The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol \n               car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a \n               sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT\n\n               Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The \n               Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center \n               divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.\n\n               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN squints against the headlights of the on-coming \n               traffic as he calmly wedges his way straight through it.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT\n\n               The lead patrol car tries to follow him but is clipped by a \n               Cadillac swerving to avoid the STAR MAN and bounced back \n               into the center divider. The last patrol car parallels the \n               Mustang in the westbound lanes.\n\n               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN realizes he's still boxed in. A car carrier \n               swerves by on his left. The lane behind is open. The STAR \n               MAN takes advantage of the opportunity.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT\n\n               The Mustang vaults off the shoulder of the highway into an \n               open field and bullets away through the weeds.\n\n               The rush of oncoming traffic traps the three patrol cars in \n               the center divider.\n\n               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT\n\n               Jenny moans as the car jostles over the rough ground. The \n               STAR MAN puts out a hand to cushion her ride. His headlights \n               pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto \n               it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting \n               across the highway after him.\n\n               EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing \n               lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of \n               dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full \n               moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.\n\n               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT\n\n               The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise \n               stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road. \n               With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car \n               and tries the gate. It is locked.\n\n               When he turns back to the car, he sees something that \n               frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A \n               helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to \n               hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other \n               side of the gate offers the only protection.\n\n               The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in \n               her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his \n               shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, \n               wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the \n               trees.\n\n               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT\n\n               The helicopter sets down behind the Mustang. Shermin leads \n               Bell, Lyman and the technicians to the car.\n\n                                     LYMAN\n                              (seeing the blood on \n                              the passenger seat)\n                         One of them must be pretty badly \n                         hurt.\n\n               Shermin pushes the seat forward. The STAR MAN's life-support \n               suit is stuffed in the space behind it. The patrol cars skid \n               around the curve.\n\n                                     SHERMIN\n                              (to Bell, indicating \n                              the suit)\n                         Get this back to the copter.\n\n               Shermin takes a bullhorn from Lyman and goes around to the \n               front of the Mustang. The highway patrolmen get out of their \n               cars behind him.\n\n                                     SHERMIN\n                              (bullhorn to woods)\n                         Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't \n                         want to hurt you or your friend. \n                         Please put down your weapon and come \n                         out.\n\n               EXT. TREES - NIGHT\n\n               Jenny's limp weight is beginning to slow the STAR MAN. He \n               hears the bullhorn but doesn't stop.\n\n               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT\n\n               Shermin lowers the bullhorn and speaks to the patrolmen.\n\n                                     SHERMIN\n                         Okay, fan out. These people have a \n                         gun but we want them alive. \n                         Understand?\n\n               EXT. TREES - NIGHT\n\n               A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely \n               hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it. \n               Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. \n               He struggles to regain his balance.\n\n               When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING \n               RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a \n               few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a \n               flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. \n               Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.\n\n               From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over \n               the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the \n               treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and \n               the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts \n               his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction \n               from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.\n\n               EXT. TREES - NIGHT\n\n               Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods \n               with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver \n               stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the \n               cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block \n               of chewing tobacco.\n\n               As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across \n               the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in \n               that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the \n               STAR MAN.\n\n                                     THIRD DRIVER\n                         Over here! They're over here!\n\n               EXT. TREES - NIGHT\n\n               Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays \n               of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. \n               He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers \n               with the pain.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (strokes her cheek)\n                         You will be all right.\n\n               He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR \n               SHOTS at the lights.\n\n               EXT. TREES - NIGHT\n\n               The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground \n               and kill their lights.\n\n                                     SHERMIN\n                         Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt \n                         you. Put down your gun and come out. \n                         We just want to talk to your friend.\n\n               THE STAR MAN AND JENNY\n\n               The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the \n               searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the \n               men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and \n               pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes \n               a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR \n               MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of \n               a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and \n               EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, \n               there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.\n\n               With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts \n               Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it \n               becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps \n               to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.\n\n               EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT\n\n               The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under \n               its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the \n               river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its \n               searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left.\n\n               EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping \n               off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter \n               is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks \n               to the ball in his language.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (subtitles)\n                         Iron channel message. Almost caught \n                         by pursuers. This may hinder escape. \n                         Wait for me.\n\n               He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the \n               others, it zips into the sky.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT\n\n               A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK \n               DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of \n               the main building.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Don't forget to tell the boys where \n                         you had a good time.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                              (calling back to her)\n                         You weren't that good.\n\n               Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks \n               between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab \n               mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that \n               covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the \n               lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He \n               takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic \n               to the house frame.\n\n               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               In the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to \n               cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as \n               it lumbers out of the parking lot.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT\n\n               With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the \n               semi picks up speed.\n\n               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped \n               on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse.\n\n               The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from \n               her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes \n               away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He \n               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in \n               her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the \n               glow of his brain through his human skin.\n\n               A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles \n               across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR \n               MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly \n               for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been \n               closed without a scar.\n\n               A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's \n               left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, \n               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends \n               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, \n               they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under \n               the skin.\n\n               Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the \n               STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around \n               something in the highway.\n\n               When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the \n               blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars \n               through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face \n               as he works over Jenny.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT\n\n               With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, \n               Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn \n               is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK\n\n               It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left \n               hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving \n               behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer \n               up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if \n               he's missed a wound. He hasn't.\n\n               He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his \n               efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that \n               Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his \n               hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The \n               green dot tells him he is still on course.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE\n\n               Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent \n               cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a \n               roadblock.

HALF HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a \n               sloppy DOWNSHIFT JOLTS the house. Her eyes flutter open and \n               she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. \n               The truck leans into the turn. Jenny braces herself on one \n               arm and sits up.\n\n               Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she \n               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. She \n               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder \n               and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows \n               she sustained. She has been completely healed and there are \n               no scars. She leans forward and looks down the hallway.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Hello... hello.\n\n               The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she \n               gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, \n               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she \n               sees the blood and bullet holes.\n\n               Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed \n               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning \n               stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the \n               sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Hello. Where are you?\n\n               There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the \n               living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed \n               back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She \n               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing \n               what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor-\n               to-ceiling picture window.\n\n               A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie \n               and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is \n               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a \n               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She \n               steps back from the window to examine it, then with some \n               trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her \n               finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.\n\n                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)\n                         Jennyhay...\n\n               Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's \n               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across \n               the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent \n               enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble \n               making herself approach it.\n\n               When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it \n               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing \n               her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR \n               MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.\n\n                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)\n                         ...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry \n                         you were shot. I was a big problem \n                         for you. Thank you for your help.

His eyebrows \n               raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the \n               end of his cigarette.\n\n               The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches \n               back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies \n               the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to \n               glow.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         She wants to become a doctor.

The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then \n               chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries \n               to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his \n               struggles.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         I got two other kids.

But I \n                         think a lot of people are just using \n                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of \n                         us off. I see it every day in the \n                         kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon \n                         cans.

Chatter from a CB under the \n               dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You sure this is your car?\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                              (with a stutter)\n                         My grandmother's rich.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (as they come up on a \n                              station wagon)\n                         Slow down, slow down.\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                         Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.\n\n               But he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they \n               pass the station wagon.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (peering at its \n                              occupants)\n                         I told you I'm looking for someone.\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                         In the cars, too?!\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I don't know where he is.\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                         This is going to be a real drag. I \n                         thought you wanted to go fast.\n\n               Howling at full throttle, three highway patrol cars rush \n               past them in the opposite direction. Jenny swivels around to \n               follow their progress until they are out of sight.\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                         They after you?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         What?

I \n                         think I could outrun them. Maybe get \n                         my picture in the papers.\n\n               Jenny takes a second look at this guy. He flashes her a gap-\n               toothed grin.\n\n               EXT. OVERPASS - DAY\n\n               The Cook's '57 Chevy makes a left on the street intersecting \n               the off-ramp and stops at the curb. Behind it a large plastic \n               yellow chicken twirls on a pole above the restaurant it \n               advertises.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         Well, here we are...

As he clears the frame, our VIEW \n               ZOOMS AND ZOOMS AND ZOOMS UNTIL we can SEE a piece of the \n               roadblock in the valley below him. During the MOVE-IN, we \n               BEGIN TO PICK UP CB CHATTER.\n\n                                     VOICES (V.O.)\n                         Flash for all you good buddies heading \n                         west on 70.

PORSCHE - DAY\n\n               Jenny TURNS DOWN the ROCK 'N ROLL to listen to the CB.\n\n                                     VOICES (V.O.)\n                         Ah loves to be frisked!

She takes her time checking \n               out the people in a VW they are passing.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (to the road ahead)\n                         We better find him before that.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY\n\n               In the style prescribed by Jenny, the STAR MAN raises his \n               thumb to a dilapidated Vega shimmying down the on-ramp. The \n               two blue-haired ladies inside are afraid to look at him as \n               they go by. He has the same luck with an attractive blonde \n               secretary that passes on the highway.\n\n               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY\n\n               A highway PATROLMAN is standing behind the open door of his \n               car speaking into the mike of his radio.\n\n                                     PATROLMAN\n                         The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin. \n                         Seems right after she talked to you, \n                         she got a ride west with a kid.\n\n               INT.

SKY ABOVE INTERSTATE 70 - DAY\n\n               Shermin's S65 banks through a U-turn and chases west.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY\n\n               A dun-colored Roadrunner gurgles down the ramp and stops in \n               front of the STAR MAN. Two grubby LONG HAIRS in worn western \n               clothes are inside with boxes of house-hold utensils and \n               duffle bags.\n\n                                     LONG HAIR\n                         Where you going?\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Las Vegas, please.\n\n                                     LONG HAIR\n                         We're going to L.A.\n\n               He looks at his buddy stretched on the jumble in the back. \n               The buddy nods.\n\n                                     LONG HAIR\n                         Sure.

PORSCHE - DAY\n\n               The CB CONTINUES TO CRACKLE with news of the roadblock. \n               Jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling \n               yellow chicken for any sign of the STAR MAN. She sees the \n               dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp \n               for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see \n               who's inside. As the Porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18-\n               wheeler and Jenny's view of the Roadrunner is cut off \n               entirely. She passes without seeing the STAR MAN.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY\n\n               The Porsche weaves through the traffic giving Jenny a chance \n               to look into the cars and trucks it shoots by.\n\n               INT.

The Teenager takes a last look at her \n               before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in \n               the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and \n               waits for cars in the fast lane to go by.\n\n               INT. ROADRUNNER - DAY\n\n               The STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into \n               the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and \n               his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in \n               the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR \n               MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner \n               plunges by her.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         JENNYHAYDN!!!\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY\n\n               Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on \n               the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs \n               by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A \n               truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into \n               the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet \n               him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it \n               swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center \n               divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head \n               against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing \n               how to respond to this human emotion.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I told you goodbye.

She \n               says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb \n               into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK \n               OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS.\n\n               EXT. SKY - DAY\n\n               Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak \n               following the twists of Interstate 70 below.

INTERSTATE 70 - DAY\n\n               Two highway patrol cars scatter the traffic in front of them \n               with their rack lights and SIRENS.\n\n               EXT. PICKUP - DAY\n\n               Jenny and the STAR MAN are sitting against the cab, a horse \n               blanket drawn up around their shoulders. They can see the \n               flashing lights coming from way down the road and watch \n               helplessly as the patrol cars eat up the distance between \n               them.\n\n               EXT.

PICKUP - DAY\n\n               For a moment, Jenny and the STAR MAN think they're safe. \n               That hope turns to despair when the two patrol cars loop \n               after them. They keep getting closer. The STAR MAN inches \n               the blanket up over his nose. Unexpectedly, the patrol cars \n               are thrown into a skid. When they stop, they are facing each \n               other ready to inspect the traffic coming off 70. They lower \n               the blanket from their faces. Jenny lays her head back against \n               the cab, exhausted.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         The Cook said I speak good English.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

Looking \n               incomplete without its trailer, the tractor/cab of a Mack \n               truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing Jenny and the \n               STAR MAN standing on the gravel. The STAR MAN looks back to \n               where they came from. There is nothing coming so he sets out \n               in the other direction.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Where are you going?\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I must meet my ship.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Why can't we wait here for a ride?\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I feel better if I move.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         We're hundreds of miles from where \n                         you have to be.\n\n               The STAR MAN ignores her and continues to walk.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (shouts at him)\n                         Even if we walk five miles, it's not \n                         going to make any difference.\n\n               Jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb. \n               The STAR MAN falls into the same pose just back of her.

ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               A torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. The STAR MAN \n               and Jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. Their heads \n               are lowered against the weather.

For the first time, the reality of \n               the situation hits him. He turns and, swearing in his own \n               language, flails at the rain. A distance from Jenny, he stops \n               and cries out in English.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I can't stay here.

BOXCAR - DUSK\n\n               The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is \n               shivering badly.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Can you close the door?\n\n               The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel \n               compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is \n               doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her \n               jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water \n               out of it.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         You are cold.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You're damn right I am.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I do not get cold.\n\n               Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the \n               STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make \n               up her mind.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (crossing to him)\n                         Open your shirt.\n\n               She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she \n               brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the \n               windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, \n               presses her bare chest against his.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (savoring it)\n                         Oh, you're warm... put your arms \n                         around me.\n\n               The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch \n               her back.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Take your shirt off.\n\n               It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. \n               He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN \n               POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR \n               MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest \n               and looks at him.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         What?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Nothing.\n\n               She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure \n               what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is \n               full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she \n               eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on \n               command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR \n               MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms \n               and extinguishes it.\n\n               INT. BOXCAR - MORNING\n\n               Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with \n               her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE.

The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying \n               to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible \n               stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the \n               door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get \n               out of the back seat.\n\n               EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to \n               stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click \n               and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be \n               everywhere.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Is this gambling?\n\n               Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty \n               dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns \n               around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out \n               into the lady's shopping bag.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         The cowboys were right.

DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside \n               the front door while Jenny goes to the counter.

While \n               the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands \n               stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a \n               cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains \n               to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest \n               route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. \n               The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting \n               in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows \n               from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one-\n               armed bandit begins to spit quarters.\n\n               INT.

Then she sees the blue haze \n               vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. \n               She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They \n               haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does \n               it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid \n               the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a \n               winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or \n               hide her face.\n\n               EXT.

SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\n               It is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting \n               up to attack the Camaro.\n\n               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its \n               new shocks save the landing.\n\n               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. \n               The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He \n               presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged \n               foothills.\n\n               The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind \n               them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING \n               WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for \n               its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a \n               moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN \n               IT FADES.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         If my ship is not here, we are in \n                         trouble.\n\n               This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she \n               flexes her fingers on the wheel.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (points at a \n                              distinctive cone \n                              peak)\n                         That's where we landed last time. \n                         Right under that mountain.\n\n               Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of \n               their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA \n               dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight \n               bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE \n               GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.\n\n               Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP \n               the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A \n               SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its \n               MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.\n\n               The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in \n               the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next \n               FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have \n               been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.\n\n               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\n               The gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes \n               the trigger.\n\n               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT\n\n               SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he \n               FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot \n               metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred \n               out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND \n               on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS \n               THEM OUT OF THE SKY.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         In front!!! In front!!!\n\n               The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of \n               the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. \n               As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO \n               its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro.\n\n               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. \n               Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the \n               strain that shows on his face.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Hang on.\n\n               She throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a \n               dirt road winding between two low hills.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a \n               stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they \n               struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra \n               roars over the hill.\n\n               INT. COBRA - NIGHT\n\n                                     FOX\n                              (spots the car)\n                         Over there.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his \n               weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight \n               from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise \n               puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm \n               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The \n               STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                              (gasps)\n                         I can't shoot anymore.\n\n               Jenny looks out between the crags. Shermin's helicopter \n               arrives to join the Cobra. With their searchlights flicking \n               over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. \n               Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN. He is too weak to run \n               anymore.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (touches his shoulder \n                              lightly)\n                         I won't let anyone hurt you.\n\n               INT.

The screens all change to a long-\n               shot of Jenny and the STAR MAN with cross-hairs superimposed \n               on them.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               Shermin's helicopter moves toward Jenny and the STAR MAN \n               standing helpless in the circle thrown by the searchlight.\n\n               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\n               The cross-hairs have locked on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Shermin \n               knows he can't do it. He picks up a headset.\n\n                                     SHERMIN\n                         George...

DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the \n               STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.\n\n               INT.

Fox's grip \n               tightens on the trigger. Suddenly the helicopter begins to \n               vibrate and drift off its target. Fox looks toward the sound \n               coming from his right and his eyes widen in fear as he sees \n               the STAR MAN's ship looming over him.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The \n               whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly \n               yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips \n               it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it \n               disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.\n\n               EXT.

It settles into a landing across the dirt road \n               resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright \n               white light blasts from the underside.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Well...\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I must go.\n\n               Jenny nods.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         What do I do now?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You say you love me and kiss me \n                         'goodbye.'\n\n               The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         I love you.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (her head on his \n                              shoulder)\n                         I'm never going to see you again, am \n                         I?\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         No.\n\n               He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I love you.\n\n               The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Tell the baby about me.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I will.\n\n                                     STAR MAN\n                         Goodbye.\n\n               He turns from her and walks to his ship.

When she looks again, it is high and moving over \n               the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips \n               low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then \n               shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it, \n               Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the \n               Camaro.\n\n               Over her walk, we SUPER:\n\n               JENNY HAYDN GAVE BIRTH TO AN EIGHT-POUND, SEVEN-OUNCE BABY \n               BOY ON MARCH 10TH.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nStarman\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bruce A.
