Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn.\r\n    We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial,\r\n    water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a\r\n    wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of\r\n    this impressive property.\r\n\r\n    Title: 'PAPADOPOULOS & SONS'\r\n\r\n                                             CUT TO:\r\n\r\n2   INT.

JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a\r\n    leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to\r\n    accommodate his son's interest in botany.

Alright. Defer the\r\n              final year. Take a year out, why not?\r\n              Fine. But don't quit.

And then we'd\r\n              argue. Probably. And she'd win. That\r\n              was your mother. At least consider\r\n              deferring.\r\n    JAMES thinks about it.\r\n\r\n                        JAMES\r\n              Okay.

You\r\n               took out crazy loans.

You never listened.\r\n               Never. It always had to be bigger,\r\n               better. Like these offices. We didn't\r\n               need these offices. Do you know how\r\n               much we paid for that 'work of art '\r\n               up there? Do you? Two hundred grand.\r\n               For a fish.\r\n\r\n     Nicholas points towards a fish hung across the wall.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n               What do you want me to do Nick?\r\n\r\n                         NICHOLAS\r\n               Our business was profitable Harry.\r\n               I was going to retire in two years.\r\n               I'd like to bring that forward.\r\n\r\n                          HARRY\r\n               You're resigning?

A standard\r\n     removal truck is parked outside alongside the Mercedes and a\r\n     Bentley sports car - displaying (PAPA 1 and PAPA 2 number\r\n     plates). Two removal men in white overalls and white gloves\r\n     (almost forensic looking) walk out the front door carrying a\r\n     large oil painting.

EVENING 4.        18\r\n\r\n     The family is sitting at the dining room table watching SPIROS\r\n     eat. No one else is eating and the table is set for one. The\r\n     dining room is spartan - less furniture/ no pictures.

There's no deal.\r\n\r\n                         HASSAN\r\n               Is this because he's Turkish?

Harry's more like that.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n               I would ask you - both of you - to\r\n               respect a man's aspiration for his\r\n               daughter.\r\n                         HASSAN\r\n               I have similar aspirations for my son.\r\n               Spiro, perhaps you should remind your\r\n               brother where he is now. Tell him to\r\n               look around. Perhaps he still sees a\r\n               big mansion with gardens and servants.\r\n               Well, I don't. But more importantly,\r\n               neither does my son.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n               This is only.

The\r\n     images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond.\r\n     Some of these shots are out of focus. Some are over exposed etc.\r\n     Some are badly framed. Sometimes the people in the shots are\r\n     aware of being photographed, sometimes not. They rotate once\r\n     every four or five seconds throughout the song. The images we\r\n     see are:\r\n\r\n     1. KATIE dangling two fish from her ears as if they are\r\n     earrings.\r\n\r\n     2.

A shot of HARRY and SPIROS outside the shop, looking at\r\n     at the camera. We are pulling out of the shot. SPIROS is\r\n     happy and smiling but HARRY is stern and serious.
