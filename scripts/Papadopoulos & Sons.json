Over and over, in my mind, I\r\n               was trying to imagine selling the\r\n               shop. Something here was saying,\r\n               no, no. I want to help you. All of\r\n               you. So I prayed for guidance. I\r\n               asked the Universe. Please help me.\r\n               Please help me help these people.\r\n               And I must've fallen asleep not\r\n               long after. A crazy sleep. And then\r\n               this dream. Banayia mou. There was\r\n               this, this music. The most\r\n               incredible music. And you and me\r\n               Harry.

Amazing how it all comes\r\n               back to you. Oh... This is!\r\n\r\n     HARRY starts to clap to the music. The others start to clap and\r\n     form a circle around him. Everyone enjoys the audacity of what\r\n     HARRY is doing as he starts to dance by himself. People passing\r\n     by stop to witness the spectacle. HARRY is in the middle,\r\n     dancing by himself. The camera pulls back as the party of people\r\n     clapping come together in a circular farandole which takes over\r\n     the street.\r\n\r\n<b>                                              CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>67   INT.
