Engine noise approaches; \n               headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.\n\n               It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- \n               a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with \n               it.\n\n               We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative \n               sedan, whose occupant does not sing.\n\n               INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE\n\n               The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt \n               and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing \n               over his forehead, and he merrily sings \"Casey Jones\" along \n               with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who \n               squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and \n               enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.\n\n               ANOTHER EMPTY STREET\n\n               The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and \n               approaches with its singing.\n\n               REVERSE\n\n               The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the \n               conservative sedan enters and recedes.\n\n               BEACH\n\n               We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, \n               squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a \n               halt.\n\n               The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a \n               half-empty bottle of champagne.\n\n               The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Number Seven.\n\n               She trots away.\n\n               The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He \n               straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with \n               one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins \n               approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Zing!\n\n               MOTEL ROOM\n\n               The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is \n               tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.\n\n               The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Choo!

He pulls on the \n               cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in \n               red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Tickets, please.\n\n               The man is stripping off his clothes.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Excuse me, Miss, is this the train \n                         to Ecsssstasy?\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're \n                         comin' to a tunnel!\n\n               Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed \n               just as --\n\n               CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black \n               man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes \n               into the room with a video camera glued to his eye.

And maybe it isn't \n                         because of these women -- maybe they \n                         were just extremely insightful and \n                         recognized our \"deficiencies\" very \n                         early on.
