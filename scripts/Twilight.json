RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN \n          \n          Moss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist \n          upward, reaching for rare sunlight. \n          \n          \n          BELLA (V.O.)\n          I'd never given much thought to how I would die..\n          \n          Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither \n          bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. \n          \n          Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. \n          Abruptly, we're on the move.

A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the \n          sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..\n          . \n          \n          \n          Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of \n          control, heading directly for her.

A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at \n          Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for\n          her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..\n          .\n          \n          \n          THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to \n          Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the\n          ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in, \n          Edward moves into the b.g.

But they show no hint of concern for his safety. \n          Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury. \n          \n          \n          38 INT.

They chortle derisively. \n          But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in \n          the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other \n          three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly \n          -\n          \n          \n\n          HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up.

Bella looks around and finally \n          sees \n          -\n          \n          \n          EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some \n          trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward \n          him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes \n          a \n          deep breath, and steps out of the shade \n          -\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          \n          \n          This is why we don't show ourselves \n          \n          \n          in sunlight..\n          . \n          \n          \n          As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if \n          embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, \n          shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He \n          moves toward her. \n          \n          \n          \n          53.\n          EDWARD\n          This is what I am.\n          \n          \n          He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..\n          . \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          You're... beautiful..\n          .\n          \n          \n          He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but \n          he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. \n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          \n          \n          (appalled)\n          Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. \n          This is the skin of a killer. \n          \n          \n          His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          I don't believe that.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Because you believe the lie. The \n          camouflage. I'm the world's most \n          dangerous predator. Everything \n          about me invites you in - my voice, \n          my face, even my smell. As if \n          I \n          need any of that..\n          .\n          \n          \n          He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by \n          a\n          tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands \n          -\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          As if you could outrun me. As if \n          you could fight me off.\n          \n          \n          He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against \n          a \n          tree trunk with explosive force. \n          \n          \n          Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. \n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          I'm designed to kill.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          I don't care.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          I've killed people.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          It doesn't matter.\n          \n          \n          \n          54.\n          EDWARD\n          I wanted to kill you.

I'm here.\n          \n          \n          She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. \n          She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is \n          nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Edward?\n          \n          \n          She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, \n          catching his breath.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          You... took me by surprise. \n          (collecting himself)\n          I don't know how to... do this.\n          \n          \n          He moves back toward her. Slowly. \n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Me, and my family, we're different \n          from others of our kind. We're not \n          nomadic, we have a permanent home. \n          We only hunt animals. We've \n          learned to control our thirst..\n          . \n          \n          \n          (shaking his head)\n          But you - your scent, it's like \n          a \n          drug to me... my own personal brand \n          of heroin. \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          (realizing)\n          Oh...

For making me want you so badly. \n          I'm still not sure I can control myself.\n          \n          \n          He reaches her again.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          I know you can.\n          \n          \n          \n          55.\n          He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her\n          face for clues.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          I wish I could understand this \n          thing you see in me.

Then he reaches toward her neck, \n          pausing..\n          .\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Be very still.\n          \n          \n          She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on \n          her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush\n          between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.\n          \n          \n          He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her \n          heart... Clouds float past the sun..\n          .\n          \n          \n          They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          And so the lion fell for the lamb.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Stupid lamb.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Sick masochistic lion.\n          \n          \n          \n          56.\n          CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as \n          they dare... his hand to her heart..\n          .\n          \n          \n          DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          \n          71 INT.

And three..\n          .\n          \n          \n          As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing \n          her to BANG into her desk.

But what Carlisle did was \n          much harder... not many of us have \n          the restraint to do that. \n          \n          \n          BELLA (V.O.\n          )\n          Didn't he just... bite?\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Not just.

No, that's just Carlisle.

WHAP! \n          Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Yer out?\n          \n          \n          Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line \n          drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet \n          and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous \n          boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! \n          \n          \n          JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest.

Little Bella looks up at us. \n          \n          \n          \n          92.\n          RENE (O.S.\n          )\n          Don't you want to dance, baby? \n          \n          \n          Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles \n          as Rene hands someone the camera. Rene, ten years younger, \n          appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Everyone makes fun of me.\n          \n          \n          RENE\n          But you're a wonderful dancer.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Mom, I suck. \n          \n          \n          LAUGHTER behind Bella. She spins, trying to locate James in \n          the mirrors. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          That's my favorite part. Stubborn \n          child, weren't you?\n          \n          \n          Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          She's not here.\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Sorry. But you really made it too easy.\n          \n          \n          Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps \n          up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          So to make things more entertaining, \n          I'm going to make a little film of our \n          time together. Borrowed this from \n          your house. Hope you don't mind. \n          \n          \n          (turns it on)\n          And... action!\n          \n          \n          Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Excellent! An escape attempt.\n          \n          \n          Suddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          It'll break Edward's little heart.\n          \n          \n          He smells her hair. Touches her throat. \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Edward has nothing to do with this.\n          \n          \n          \n          93.\n          JAMES\n          He will. His rage will make for \n          more interesting sport than his \n          feeble attempt to protect you.\n          \n          \n          He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in\n          her hand. She spins around and sprays him. \n          \n          \n          Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly. But he leaps \n          over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. \n          \n          \n          Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. \n          She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it \n          on film. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. \n          I chose my stage well.\n          \n          \n          He advances toward her.\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that \n          what makes you special? Because \n          frankly, I don't see it. \n          \n          \n          He inhales as if he can taste her already \n          -\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Too bad he didn't have the strength \n          to turn you. Instead, he kept you \n          this fragile little human. It's \n          cruel, really. \n          \n          \n          James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper \n          spray. He tries to wipe it off.\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Well done! You've succeeded in \n          annoying me.\n          \n          \n          He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in \n          agony. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Tell Edward how much it hurts. \n          \n          \n          Abruptly, the camera is in her face \n          -\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Tell him to avenge you.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          No!

Bella, \n          half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face \n          -\n          \n          \n          VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE\n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          Cut! The end.\n          \n          \n          Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! \n          \n          \n          He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James \n          CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. \n          \n          \n          JAMES\n          You're alone... because you're \n          faster than the others. But not \n          stronger.\n          \n          \n          James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          I'm strong enough to kill you.\n          \n          \n          Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through \n          a \n          freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up \n          and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he \n          and Bella are JERKED downward.\n          \n          \n          James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella \n          out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top \n          window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. \n          \n          \n          James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND \n          -\n          \n          \n          Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS \n          HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. \n          \n          \n          Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement \n          and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through \n          the floorboards.\n          \n          \n          ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins. \n          \n          \n          BELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of \n          focus. \n          \n          \n          Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY \n          of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when -\n          -\n          \n          \n          Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle.\n          Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like \n          a \n          baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. \n          \n          \n          James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of \n          her pain slices through Edward.

Bella turns back to find \n          Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes \n          well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Is James - did you -- \n          ?\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          We took care of him.

CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136\n          \n          \n          At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. \n          Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant \n          suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The\n          front door opens and they look up to see \n          -\n          \n          \n          BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward \n          is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to \n          her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          \n          \n          Alice lent me the dress. It was the \n          \n          \n          only thing that would fit over my \n          \n          \n          cast.

MANSION, VIEW POINT INN - TWILIGHT 137\n          \n          \n          Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella\n          out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining \n          room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may \n          notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          \n          \n          I can't believe you're making me do \n          \n          \n          this.\n          \n          \n          He just grins.

MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - TWILIGHT 138\n          \n          \n          THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette \n          wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, \n          dance and socialize. \n          \n          \n          \n          101.\n          BELLA\n          You really are trying to kill me.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Prom is an important rite of \n          passage. I don't want you to miss \n          anything. \n          \n          \n          She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.\n          They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees \n          -\n          \n          \n          THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two \n          couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and \n          Emmett, looking absolutely stunning. \n          \n          \n          Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But \n          Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we \n          hear a crossfade into the next track-\n          \n          \n          BELLA'S POV -- THE DJ BOOTH \n          -\n          \n          \n          It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce! Next to\n          him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of \n          vinyl. They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -\n          -\n          \n          \n          A FLASHBULB gets her attention \n          -\n          \n          \n          BELLA'S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER'S STATION\n          \n          \n          Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out. \n          Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond \n          impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.\n          \n          \n          Edward smirks, then turns to Bella \n          -\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Shall we? \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          (laughs, then realizes)\n          You're serious.\n          \n          \n          He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to\n          the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and \n          starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          See? You're dancing.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          At prom.\n          \n          \n          As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes \n          thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.\n          \n          \n          \n          102.\n          BELLA\n          Edward... why did you save me?\n          (off his questioning look)\n          If you'd let the venom spread, \n          I could've been like you by now.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          \n          \n          (stops, horrified)\n          You don't know what you're saying. \n          You don't want this.\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          I want you.

Every minute, \n          I get closer, older \n          \n          EDWARD\n          That's how it's supposed to happen. \n          \n          BELLA\n          Not the way Alice saw it. \n          (off his sharp look)\n          I heard her. She saw me like you. \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Her visions change, Bella. \n          \n          BELLA\n          Based on what someone decides. And \n          I've decided.\n          \n          \n          He looks at her, angry. \n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          Is that what you dream about? \n          Becoming a monster? \n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          I dream about being with you forever. \n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          You really want this?\n          \n          \n          BELLA\n          Yes.\n          \n          \n          He lowers his lips to her neck.

Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.\n          \n          \n          EDWARD\n          You're going to have a long and \n          happy life with me.

We realize ..\n          \n          ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of \n          a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in \n          echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..\n          \n          VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed\n          now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her \n          throat.
