I mean, i's\r\n          science. I'm-I don't want a relationship\r\n          either. Let's just say that. And I\r\n          wouldn't even care whatever you do or I\r\n          do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like\r\n          no strings attached at all.

I was gonna get a haircut today.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Yeah, they say that every couple months\r\n          it's good to trim the ends, you know, get\r\n          all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've\r\n          cut hair before.\r\n          He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.\r\n\r\n                         TED\r\n          Well, like I said I got stuff to do.\r\n          Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Yeah, me too.

Made from scratch.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DRIVEWAY\r\n\r\n          Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted\r\n          repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor.\r\n\r\n                         TED\r\n          Sometimes it sticks!\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          No, I love it!\r\n          The gate starts to open.

STREET. OUTSIDE THE GATE\r\n\r\n          Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an\r\n          exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Oh, shit.\r\n          The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.\r\n\r\n          INT. ANNIE'S CAR IN TRAFFIC. CONTINUOUS.\r\n\r\n          Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.\r\n\r\n          INT. LILLIAN'S BEDROOM.\r\n\r\n          Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional\r\n          clothes.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          It's summer?! What the hell does that\r\n          mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid\r\n          now.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          No he's stupid Ann, not you.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I think I might be a little bit stupid.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Ew. Did you have sex with him?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          No! But I gave him a blow job.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          What?!\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Well, he kept putting it in my face.\r\n          Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a\r\n          Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his\r\n          muscles trying to make her laugh.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Well, at least he was honest with you so\r\n          you don't waste your time with him.\r\n\r\n                         DOUGIE\r\n          Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at\r\n          all this sweat.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm\r\n          talking to Annie.\r\n\r\n                         DOUGIE\r\n          Hey Annie.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for\r\n          women you know?\r\n\r\n                         DOUGIE\r\n          Shit. Really?!\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          It's not gonna do anything to you.\r\n\r\n                         DOUGIE\r\n          Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger.\r\n          He tries to rub up against Lillian.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Ew, go take a shower.\r\n          Dougie leaves.\r\n\r\n          DOUGIE (O.S.)\r\n          I'm gonna play with my new boobs in\r\n          there.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          I swear I cannot handle him right now. He\r\n          has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it\r\n          feels like I'm kissing my brother. I\r\n          don't know what do.\r\n          Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY\r\n          STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the\r\n          car. A white blouse and navy skirt.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          At least you have someone. God, wha's\r\n          wrong with me?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          There's nothing wrong with you. But I\r\n          think maybe, and don't get mad at me,\r\n          I've said this to you before, you need to\r\n          stop trying so hard.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I still don't think I do that.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          OK, so you had a first date last night.\r\n          Did you bring him a present?\r\n          Annie is silent.\r\n\r\n          LILLIAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Ann, what did I tell you?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I brought him lemon-bars because I was\r\n          making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're\r\n          right, that's weird.\r\n\r\n          DOUGIE (O.S.)\r\n          Shit!\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          What?!\r\n\r\n          DOUGIE (O.S)\r\n          I just chipped a nail!\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm\r\n          tired or what, but I wanna kill him.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the\r\n          mirror and remember when I was getting my\r\n          braces off and farted at the\r\n          orthodontist.\r\n          Lillian laughs.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          Oh my God.

(giggling)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n\r\n          FANTASY. UPSCALE PARTY. LIKE AN OVERDRAMATIC PERFUME AD.\r\n          Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender.\r\n\r\n                         BARTENDER\r\n          Well, with that dress on you look\r\n          about... .eleven.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Thank you.\r\n          Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male\r\n          model in a tuxedo.\r\n\r\n          HOT MAN IN TUX\r\n          Excuse me, you dropped an earring.\r\n          An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear.\r\n\r\n                         UNDERWEAR MODEL\r\n          I'll get it for her.\r\n\r\n          MAN IN SURGEONS SCRUBS\r\n          No I will!\r\n\r\n          MAN IN RED BATHING SUIT\r\n          I'll get it! I'm a lifeguard.\r\n          Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos\r\n          forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE. She\r\n          runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest.\r\n          They men begin to chase her.\r\n          She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to\r\n          face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping\r\n          wood. It's CHRISTIAN BALE.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Hi.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTIAN BALE\r\n          Hi. I'm Christian Bale.

The reason I pulled you over\r\n          today, is that--(searching) you were\r\n          driving too slow.

And that one\r\n          may not be the right door, but i'll open\r\n          up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway,\r\n          it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I\r\n          opened a door and the next thing I knew I\r\n          was a cop. And I love my job.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Hmm.

But before I do,\r\n          here's a message from SUSAN SARANDON!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101.\r\n\r\n          SUSAN SARANDON (V.O.)\r\n          Hello, I'm Susan Sarandon, the movie\r\n          star.

As she\r\n          gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They\r\n          smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by.\r\n          At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.\r\n\r\n                         BUTLER\r\n          Are you a guest of Helen Harris?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Yes.\r\n\r\n                         BUTLER\r\n          The shower is one mile away.\r\n          He hands her a pink lemonade.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I don't have a cup-holder.\r\n          As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside\r\n          her car.\r\n\r\n          ANNIE (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         WHAT THE-\r\n          One flies in her car. They're Rose petals!\r\n          Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose\r\n          petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a\r\n          pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from\r\n          the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and\r\n          take it.\r\n\r\n                         VALET\r\n          This will be placed in the gift room for\r\n          you madame.\r\n          He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I'll take those.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          103.\r\n          Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she\r\n          turns back around, there is a man with a white horse\r\n          holding out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n                         HORSEMAN\r\n          Would you like an assisted ride to the\r\n          main house?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Do I have to?\r\n          An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with\r\n          the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She\r\n          dismounts.\r\n          The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she\r\n          enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...\r\n\r\n                         SHOWER GIRLS\r\n          This is the most amazing shower 've ever\r\n          been to/Can you believe this?/What a\r\n          lucky bride/What a good friend...\r\n          Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches\r\n          are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear\r\n          French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and\r\n          bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the\r\n          middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009csign\u00e2\u0080\u009d that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cLillian and Dougie\u00e2\u0080\u009d in puffy pink\r\n          cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne.

That was a pretty gutsy\r\n          move.\r\n\r\n                         MEGAN\r\n          Annie's the one who tried to make him eat\r\n          a car jack.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Helen hit him over the head with a tree.\r\n          They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.\r\n\r\n          ANNIE (CONT'D)\r\n          There it is, turn left up here. Go down\r\n          the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway.\r\n          It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM\r\n          THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met.\r\n\r\n                         LESLIE\r\n          God I haven't been here in forever.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          The house is right up here.\r\n          They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          Her car's not here.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          Doesn't look like any lights are on.\r\n\r\n                         BECCA\r\n          She's not here.\r\n          Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          131.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I thought she'd be here. I really thought\r\n          she'd be here. I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          Annie, it's ok.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          No, it's not. I don't know what happened.\r\n          I messed everything up. Lillia's not\r\n          even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid\r\n          to see what's really happening.\r\n          Lillian's moving on to this great life\r\n          and I feel left behind. And know matter\r\n          how hard I try, I don't fit in to her\r\n          life now.\r\n          Everyone is silent.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I\r\n          haven't made things easy for you.. I\r\n          don't have a life and I am bored. Perry\r\n          is always away and I'm constantly alone\r\n          and she's been there. And I've been a\r\n          bridesmaid nine times and although I may\r\n          have implied it, I....I've never been a\r\n          Maid of Honor. I wanted to make\r\n          everything special for Lillian because...\r\n          I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted\r\n          her to like me better and to impress her,\r\n          and everyone else. And I'm just good at\r\n          throwing parties. I always have been. In\r\n          fact sometimes I think people only ask me\r\n          to be in their wedding's because of that.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked\r\n          you to be in her wedding it's because you\r\n          are her friend. Trust me.\r\n          Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled\r\n          by the flash.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I'm sorry that when I left the shower I\r\n          told your neighbors you were shooting a\r\n          porn.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          132.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          Oh, I didn't know that you did that.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Oh, well, sorry.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          I deserved it.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          I must say you do put on some pretty\r\n          spectacular events.\r\n\r\n                         HELEN\r\n          Well, I'm really rich.\r\n          They smile.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          It is getting pretty late.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          What should we do about Lillian?\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          She'll come home when she's ready.\r\n\r\n          INT.

And now, it's become this\r\n          thing I never wanted. I did want simple.\r\n          I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights\r\n          and food everywhere.

I'm scared. I'm gonna be the\r\n          oldest one there.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          So what? Now you can have an affair with\r\n          your teacher and it won't be gross.\r\n          They walk down the steps.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Thanks for everything today. Yo've been\r\n          the best Maid of Honor ever.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Really?\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          (kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at\r\n          all. You were pretty terrible. Today you\r\n          were good.\r\n          Annie sees the hotel shuttle.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to\r\n          the hotel.\r\n\r\n                         LILLIAN\r\n          You're always gonna be my best friend.\r\n          They hug goodbye.

Annie\r\n          runs towards the shuttle.\r\n          She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She\r\n          JUST missed it.\r\n\r\n          ANNIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course.\r\n          The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on\r\n          the other side of it.\r\n\r\n          RHODES (O.C.)\r\n          Need a ride ma'am?\r\n          It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen\r\n          candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          How did you know I was here?\r\n\r\n                         RHODES\r\n          It was really complicated. I remembered\r\n          the name of this place, I called them up,\r\n          told them I was a cop calling on official\r\n          police business, doing a very big\r\n          investigation and uh, made them tell me\r\n          all the weddings they had planned for the\r\n          next two months with a bride named\r\n          Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]\r\n          Annie smiles.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Wow.\r\n          They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\n          ANNIE (CONT'D)\r\n          So, did you get the moonpies?\r\n\r\n                         RHODES\r\n          Yes I did.\r\n\r\n                         ANNIE\r\n          Did you like' em?\r\n\r\n                         RHODES\r\n          Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them.
