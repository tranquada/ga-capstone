THEY HAVE\n     BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.\n\n\n\n\n     FADE IN:\n\n\n     EXT. SNOWSCAPE\n\n     A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous\n     low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19\"\n     television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO\n     BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a\n     distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see\n     that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice\n     sheet in an otherwise featureless land.\n\n     A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.\n\n\n     CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN\n\n     Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are\n     dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we\n     squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting\n     foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They\n     continue toward us, the wind beating against them,\n     CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before\n     them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.\n\n\n     FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES\n\n     As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in\n     the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the\n     men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their\n     quarry.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT. ICE CAVE\n\n     Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the\n     thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the\n     Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The\n     sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,\n     illuminating their faces. And:\n\n     A CREATURE\n\n     Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We\n     get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,\n     seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,\n     dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves\n     quickly enough away that any other identifying feature\n     is lost in the deeper shadows.\n\n     THE PRIMITIVES\n\n     Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under\n     their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the\n     constricting cavern, giving chase.\n\n     Following them as they moves with animal-like agility\n     through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their\n     torchlight catching:\n\n     THE CREATURE\n\n     As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller\n     crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives\n     entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.\n     The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,\n     pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.\n     Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on\n     the run.\n\n\n     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN\n\n     The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead\n     man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what\n     appears to be a box cavern.\n\n     CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE\n\n     Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch\n     illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead\n     Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does\n     finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's\n     ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.\n\n     The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is\n     difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature\n     squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn\n     to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:\n\n     THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN\n\n     Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body\n     of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is\n     driven away into the shadows.\n\n     The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his\n     hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the\n     Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are\n     covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the\n     First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.\n\n     The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,\n     stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has\n     collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first\n     time, on its face.\n\n     When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.\n     But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and\n     dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong\n     hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the\n     Creature's eye.\n\n\n     LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE\n\n     The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the\n     dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the\n     oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As\n     if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling\n     into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.\n\n\n     ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE\n\n     Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the\n     fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have\n     spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his\n     eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.\n\n     Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES\n     UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the\n     cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY\n     with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and\n     silence. But only for a moment. Until:\n\n\n     SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT\n     DAY\n\n     Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the\n     earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes\n     and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST\n     CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of\n     the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained\n     GASPING.\n\n     Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS\n     of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot\n     sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward\n     in time.\n\n                            2ND BOY\n               Hey, Stevie. You okay?\n\n\n     INT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY\n\n     THEIR POV OF STEVIE\n\n     On the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and\n     mouth. Spitting out. (All these boys have Texas in their\n     voices.)\n\n                            STEVIE\n               I got...I got....I got....\n                      (straining)\n               ....the wind knocked out of me.\n\n     This draws no sympathy from above, only LAUGHTER.\n\n     THE BOYS UP ABOVE\n\n     Staring excitedly.\n\n                            3RD BOY\n               Looks like a cave or something.\n\n                            2ND BOY\n               What's down there, Stevie? Anything?\n\n     OVER THE BOYS ABOVE\n\n     Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of\n     sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then\n     reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:\n\n                            STEVIE\n               Human skull.\n\n     One side partially missing from the cranium. But it\n     brings WHOOPS of delight from the boys above.\n\n                            3RD BOY\n               Toss it up here, dude.\n\n                            STEVIE\n               No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's\n               mine.\n\n     ANGLE UP ON STEVIE\n\n     The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at\n     the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is\n     milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow\n     glassy in places. Then:\n\n                            STEVIE\n               Anyways, there's bones all over the\n               place down here.\n\n     Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK\n     DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And\n     something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,\n     standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is\n     climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over\n     the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then\n     the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard\n     floor of the cave.\n\n     CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES\n\n     Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting\n     aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED\n     by a shivering seizure of some kind.\n\n     CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they\n     move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his\n     bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to\n     Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.\n     Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the\n     wind was knocked out of him.\n\n                            3RD BOY (O.S.)\n               Hey, Stevie....\n\n     But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to\n     the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes\n     go wide.\n\n                            2ND BOY\n               You okay?\n\n     But what they see next answers that question for them.\n\n     THEIR POV OF STEVIE\n\n     His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.\n     Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK\n     OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE BOYS ABOVE\n\n     Freaked by what they see. And doing what any kid would\n     do now.\n\n                            3RD BOY\n               Hey, man. Let's get outta here.\n\n     And they do. Bolting from the hole in the top of the\n     cave. CAMERA PUSHING UP THROUGH THIS HOLE to REVEAL we\n     are:\n\n\n     EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY\n\n     In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids.\n     RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt\n     patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast\n     as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT\n     (five floorplans to choose from, including the model\n     home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND\n     appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.\n\n     CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the\n     surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the\n     distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.\n\n     As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing\n     but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the\n     landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.\n\n\n     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY\n\n     Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling\n     into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING\n     AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping\n     off, moving to the hole the boys dug.\n\n     LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT\n     HOLE\n\n     TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA,\n     THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two\n     firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of\n     the hole watching them. Holding a radio.\n\n                            FIRE CAPTAIN\n               This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've\n               got a rescue situation in progress...\n\n\n     INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     As the LEAD FIREMAN steps down the ladder into the cave.\n     He scans the darkness, illuminated only by the shaft of\n     light permitted by the hole above. As the 2ND FIREMAN\n     drops down next to him. The both stand motionless now,\n     as if sensing something.\n\n     THEIR POV\n\n     Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave,\n     a short distance away.\n\n     RESUME FIREMEN - LOW ANGLE\n\n     They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING\n     their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK\n     SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five\n     thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we\n     HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive.\n\n                                             TIME CUT TO:\n\n\n     EXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER\n\n     CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF\n     NEIGHBORS:\n\n     Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends.\n     They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen.\n     Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking\n     at:\n\n     A MED-EVAC CHOPPER\n\n     Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at\n     high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the\n     neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just\n     over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard\n     scrabble.\n\n     The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE\n     PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA\n     PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The\n     Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire\n     Captain watches this, then stares toward --\n\n     DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the\n     chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him\n     in route.\n\n                            BRONSCHWEIG\n                      (over the chopper)\n               Keep those people back. Get them out\n               of here.\n\n                            FIRE CAPTAIN\n                      (to his men)\n               Move them all back.\n                      (dogging Bronschweig)\n               I sent four men down after the boy.\n               They're not responding.\n\n     Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's\n     making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie\n     is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed\n     QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.\n     Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good\n     look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.\n\n     ANGLE ON CHOPPER\n\n     As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid\n     shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes\n     flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop\n     wash blowing:\n\n     DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n\n     And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper\n     bank away, then turns his look to:\n\n     THE NEIGHBORHOOD\n\n     Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are\n     rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks\n     like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE\n     UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these\n     vehicles.)\n\n     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG\n\n     As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.\n\n                            FIRE CAPTAIN\n               What about my men?\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n                      (brusquely)\n               We're doing all we can.\n\n     And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the\n     MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles,\n     scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what\n     the hell's going on. Watching the first of many\n     REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel\n     carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.\n     Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.\n\n     HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The\n     sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing\n     we are:\n\n\n     EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY\n\n     The chopper is banking over the side of the building,\n     preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI\n     AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND\n     appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK\n     LATER.\n\n     The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is\n     thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT\n     IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.\n\n     Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,\n     approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps\n     up.\n\n                            FBI AGENT\n               We've evacuated the building and been\n               through it bottom to top. No trace of\n               an explosive device or anything\n               resembling one.\n\n                            S.A.C. MICHAUD\n               Have you taken the dogs through?\n\n                            FBI AGENT\n               Yes, sir.\n\n                            S.A.C. MICHAUD\n               Well, take them through again.\n\n     This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat\n     weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud\n     does not register this attitude, though. Something else\n     has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the\n     edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what\n     he sees now.\n\n     On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI\n     AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA\n     CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C\n     Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like\n     what he sees. And what he sees is:\n\n\n     EXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading\n     onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too,\n     is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her\n     cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for\n     something. Dialing the number of:\n\n                            SCULLY\n               Mulder -- it's me --\n\n                            MULDER (FILTER)\n               Where are you, Scully?\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I'm on the roof.\n\n                            MULDER (FILTER)\n               Did you find something?\n\n                            SCULLY\n                      (impatiently)\n               No. I haven't.\n\n                            MULDER (FILTER)\n               What's wrong, Scully?\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm\n               hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to\n               be honest, what I'm doing here.\n\n                            MULDER (FILTER)\n               You're looking for a bomb.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I know that. But the threat was called\n               in for the Federal Building across the\n               street.\n\n                            MULDER (FILTER)\n               I think they have that covered.\n\n     WE ARE TRACKING WITH SCULLY.\n\n                            SCULLY\n                      (impatience)\n               Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat\n               is called in, the logical purpose of\n               providing this information is to allow\n               us to find the bomb. The rational\n               object of terrorism is to promote\n               terror.

REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to\n     find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's\n     room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his\n     wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in\n     this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and\n     exits into the alley.\n\n\n     EXT.

There is a moment;\n     one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure\n     what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving\n     himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes\n     this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But\n     Kurtzweil hails him again.\n\n                            KURTZWEIL\n               My name's Kurtzweil.

Don't pretend you don't\n               know about the Project. Your father\n               died for it. Your sister was taken\n               because of it.\n\n     Kurtzweil finishes nature's call.

Moving a work light, as he had\n     done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on\n     the face of the fireman. But when he does this,\n     Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away.\n     Reacting to:\n\n     ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY\n\n     The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned\n     into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and\n     tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due\n     to the fact that the creature which was inside is now\n     gone.\n\n     CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the\n     temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius.\n     WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked.\n\n                                             INTERCUT WITH:\n\n\n     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY\n\n     ANGLE DOWN ON EARTHEN HOLE, where the Technicians\n     Bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to\n     Bronschweig's MUFFLED VOICE. He's down below them in the\n     cave, looking up.\n\n     Pulling his haz-mat hood off. Yelling up to them.\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               It's gone!\n\n                            TECHNICIAN\n               It's what?\n\n     OVER THE TECHNICIANS TO BRONSCHWEIG DOWN BELOW\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               It's left the body. I think it's\n               gestated --\n\n     Bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something\n     stops him.\n\n\n     RESUME INT. ICE CAVE\n\n     CREATURE'S POV OF BRONSCHWEIG\n\n     He stands frozen on the ladder, squinting into the\n     darkness.\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               Wait -- I see it --\n\n     BRONSCHWEIG'S POV\n\n     In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging\n     into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is\n     fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the\n     opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind\n     of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.\n\n     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG - CREATURE'S POV\n\n     He remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a\n     moment, then takes a gentle step back down to the\n     ground.\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n                      (nervous wonder)\n               Oh my god. Oh my god.\n\n                            TECHNICIAN\n               You see it?\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get\n               down here --\n                      (sotto to himself)\n               Jesus Lord...so much for little green\n               men.\n\n     Dr. Bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the\n     ampule again...when, suddenly, the Creature STRIKES.\n     CAMERA RUSHING FORWARD TO BRONSCHWEIG.\n\n                                             MATCH CUT TO:\n\n     OVERHEAD ANGLE - OVER THE TECHNICIANS\n\n     As the Creature slams into Bronschweig, knocking him out\n     of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole.\n\n     There are SCREAMS OF PAIN from Bronschweig, then they\n     abate.\n\n     RESUME INT. ICE CAVE\n\n     Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in\n     the shadows himself now.\n\n     Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do\n     this, teetering back into the light we see that he is\n     bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back\n     toward the patch of light that comes from the hole\n     above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while\n     keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows,\n     for another attack by the Creature.\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               Hey -- I need help.\n\n     But the Technicians looking down on him offer him\n     nothing of the sort. All they do is quickly close the\n     clear hatch that seals Bronschweig inside the cave.\n\n                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n               Hey!\n\n     But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A\n     moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls\n     onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light.\n     They are burying Bronschweig alive.\n\n\n     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY\n\n     ANGLE DOWN ON BRONSCHWEIG through the glass hatch. His\n     SCREAMS continue. ADJUSTING to the small bulldozer which\n     is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the\n     hole from which it came. While, all around, there is a\n     hive of activity. Men running everywhere.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     RESUME INT.

Its grotesque features\n     in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA.\n     Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury.\n     Its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh - AT CAMERA -\n     driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in\n     momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of\n     OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about.

He is also a member of the syndicate\n     running \"The Project\", though his venality is cloaked in\n     civility and statesmanship.

The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window\n     where he sees some of the HELP is running from the\n     house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who\n     seems to have hurt himself.

He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD.\n\n     The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and\n     dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates.\n     Indeed some are.\n\n     Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's\n     interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of\n     a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know.\n\n     But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who\n     holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture.\n\n                            STRUGHOLD\n               We began to worry.

Then move cautiously across an open area to one\n     of the domes.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT\n\n     Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens\n     with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is\n     pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both\n     JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with\n     hard blasts of air.\n\n     Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into\n     the still silence of the space beyond.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               Cool in here.

The effect is a combination\n     of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech.\n     The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't\n     yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed\n     tent houses.\n\n     Though the air is still and there is no movement of any\n     kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A\n     STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.\n\n     Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the\n     space.\n\n     WIDE ON TENT - MULDER AND SCULLY'S POV\n\n     Laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look\n     like BOXES. Fixed in place like roof vents, except these\n     are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and\n     about the same measure square.\n\n     NEW ANGLE - TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY\n\n     As they continue to move cautiously, walking out into\n     the grid of box-shaped objects. Coming to the center of\n     the capacious, arena-sized space. Standing over one of\n     the mysterious boxes, which we now see have LOUVERED\n     TOPS. The louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is\n     inside the boxes cannot be seen.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I think we're on top of something. I\n               think these are some kind of venting.\n\n     Mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.\n\n                            MULDER\n               You hear that?\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I hear the humming.

When A LOUD METALLIC NOISE makes them jump.\n\n     AGENTS POV THE LOUVERED VENTS ABOVE THEM\n\n     One of the vents is opening automatically, its large\n     metal louvers straining from their flat closed position\n     into an up-and-down open position. When this is\n     complete, the SECOND LOUVER does the same.\n\n     The straining sound of galvanized metal-on-metal.\n\n     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY\n\n     As Mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to\n     the mysterious box they're standing next to. Something\n     occurs to him. Something frightening.\n\n                            MULDER\n               Scully....?\n\n                            SCULLY\n               Yeah...?\n\n                            MULDER\n               Run.\n\n     Mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. Though she\n     doesn't know why. Or what's about to happen. TRACKING\n     FAST WITH THEM as Mulder leads her back toward the door\n     they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.\n\n                            SCULLY\n                      (yelling, on the run)\n               What are you doing?\n\n                            MULDER\n                      (yelling back)\n               Come on!\n\n     When the LOUVERED VENTS on all the low grid-arranged\n     boxes OPEN IN DOMINO-LIKE SUCCESSION -- out of them\n     pouring THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BEES, rapidly filling\n     the atmosphere of the domed space.\n\n     As if the insects are being shot out of non-stop\n     cannons.\n\n     HIGH ANGLE\n\n     THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for\n     the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and\n     Scully run for it down below.\n\n     TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY\n\n     Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her\n     jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now,\n     ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are\n     slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way\n     toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But\n     motion seems to be the key.\n\n     As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast\n     of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see\n     that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing\n     her way in the process, losing her bearings as the\n     thickening swarm of bees descends.\n\n     CLOSE ON SCULLY\n\n     When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head\n     again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and\n     swinging her toward the direction of the door.\n     Whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the\n     doorfans. Following right behind her as the fans\n     BLASTING them and the Agents continue right out the\n     doors. To:\n\n\n     EXT.

The bright beams skimming across the ground\n     toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the\n     edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to\n     spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.\n\n     And they do -- bolting just as the beams and the\n     helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments\n     before.

As the Agents zig and zag just out of the\n     discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their\n     heads.\n\n     REVERSE ON CHOPPERS\n\n     Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and\n     swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers.\n     The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down\n     so as to reveal anything hidden within.\n\n     The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape\n     detection.\n\n     LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY\n\n     as she runs up INTO FRAME.

When one\n     of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an\n     intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder\n     and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder\n     down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn,\n     sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading\n     RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD\n\n     Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a\n     quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the\n     chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam\n     narrowly missing Mulder.\n\n     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER\n\n     Running the corner of the field, looking frantically\n     down each corn row until he comes to a stop.

As fast\n     as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff\n     where their car is parked.\n\n\n     EXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT\n\n     Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness,\n     until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up\n     from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their\n     car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but\n     the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and\n     over but it won't kick.\n\n     As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE\n     BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff,\n     appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind\n     the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...\n\n     ...Mulder gets the car started, throwing the\n     transmission in gear and spinning the tires. As they\n     head off back in the direction they came, without their\n     lights on. As they do this, the black chopper continues\n     to hover for a moment, then BANKS OFF AND AWAY.

When,\n     unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING\n     to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from\n     Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat,\n     then goes after him.\n\n     Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     EXT.

These\n               people don't make mistakes, Agent\n               Mulder.\n\n     And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder\n     to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly\n     Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him.\n\n     MULDER'S POV\n\n     Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only\n     see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear\n     he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the\n     figure slides away and disappears.\n\n     ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING\n\n     We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face\n     we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder\n     coming out of the vending room, not long before the\n     building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now,\n     disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to\n     find:\n\n     MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment\n     until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction\n     Kurtzweil disappeared in.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT.

Moving to the desk and going\n     at this pace through the drawers. Looking for... A\n     PICTURE ALBUM.\n\n     Which he takes now, leafing through it. Flipping the\n     pages, looking for:\n\n     ANGLE OVER MULDER\n\n     Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his\n     SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The\n     plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these\n     photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A\n     picnic possibly.\n\n     Mulder stares at the picture.\n\n     INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head\n     turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.\n\n     Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK\n     at his door. Mulder turning to see:\n\n     SCULLY\n\n     In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door.\n     Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same\n     clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A\n     gaze that says bad news.\n\n                            MULDER\n               What?

HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n     WIDE ANGLE FROM END OF HALL where we see Scully,\n     leaving Mulder's apartment. Moving at a hurried clip to\n     the elevator -- TOWARD CAMERA. As if anticipating her\n     own impulse to turn around and go back. As she moves\n     into f.g. Mulder exits his apt. door.\n\n                            MULDER\n               You're wrong --\n\n     He hurries to catch her.

If I quit now,\n               they win.\n\n     She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to\n     be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly\n     and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration\n     and... kisses him on the forehead. When...\n\n     ...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A\n     heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity\n     for the inevitable has presented itself.\n\n     The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at\n     Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves\n     slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to\n     her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation\n     on her part, there is also desire. When:\n\n                            SCULLY\n               OUCH!!!\n\n     Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where\n     his hand had been.\n\n                            MULDER\n               What?

So that we\n               might save ourselves, as the last of\n               the species.\n                      (beat)\n               Your father wisely refused to believe\n               this, choosing hope over selfishness.\n               Hope is the only future he had: his\n               children,\n                      (beat, then self-revealing)\n               The only future any of us have.\n\n     This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.\n\n                            MULDER\n               But... he sacrificed his own daughter.\n               My sister, Samantha.\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               The only true survivors of the viral\n               holocaust will be those immune to it:\n               those vaccinated against it and\n               human/alien hybrids. Your father\n               arranged for your sister's abduction.\n               He allowed her to be taken to an alien\n               hybrid program, so that she would\n               survive. As a clone.\n                      (beat)\n               He had different hopes for you. That\n               you would uncover the truth about the\n               Project. That you would stop it. That\n               you would fight the future.\n\n     Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny\n     has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just\n     justified.\n\n                            MULDER\n               Why are you telling me this?\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               I thought it only fair you should\n               know, given how hard you've worked.\n\n                            MULDER\n               What happened to Kurtzweil?\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               As your father knew, things need to be\n               sacrificed to the future.\n\n                            MULDER\n               Where is he?\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.\n\n     Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded\n     expression.\n\n                            MULDER\n               Let me out.

When he turns\n     back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is\n     now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded\n     arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               The men I work with will stop at\n               nothing to clear the way for what they\n               believe is their stake in the\n               inevitable future. I was ordered to\n               kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to\n               protect my grandchildren's lives.\n                      (beat)\n               I might just as easily kill you.\n\n     Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without\n     hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in\n     the head.\n\n     The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on\n     Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.\n\n     Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be\n     next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply\n     opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the\n     door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions\n     that went just before.\n\n\n     EXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT\n\n     Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope.\n     The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense\n     look.\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n                      (with quiet force)\n               You have precious little time. What\n               I've given you the alien colonists\n               have no idea exists.

Its\n               introduction into an alien environment\n               may have the power to destroy the\n               delicate plans we've so assiduously\n               protected for the last fifty years.\n                      (beat)\n               Or it may not.\n\n                            MULDER\n               What alien environment?\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her\n               science can save the future.\n\n                            MULDER\n               What about you?\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               My life is over.\n                      (beat)\n               Go.\n\n     Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M.\n     points the weapon he's still holding at him.\n\n                            WELL-MANICURED MAN\n               Go now!\n\n     And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back\n     over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back\n     into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later...\n     THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the\n     ground.\n\n     ANGLE ON MULDER\n\n     The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its\n     contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with\n     COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.\n\n     Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the\n     envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running\n     as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he\n     disappears.\n\n     As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we\n     hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The\n     same sound that opened our story.\n\n     Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a\n     horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between\n     the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We\n     are:\n\n\n     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA\n\n     Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on\n     the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND\n     appears, to establish.\n\n     CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR\n\n     Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed\n     insect.\n\n\n     INT. SNOW TRACTOR\n\n     Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed\n     cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in\n     thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a\n     stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his\n     position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all\n     movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard\n     out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there\n     is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog\n     from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing\n     but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then\n     reaching for the door latch.\n\n     RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR\n\n     Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the\n     snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device\n     held before him. In this forbidding environment he might\n     as well be taking a space walk -- without the security\n     of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his\n     tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the\n     distance between himself and the snow tractor.\n\n     MOVING WITH MULDER\n\n     Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.\n     Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something\n     now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping\n     instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen\n     by:\n\n     MULDER'S POV\n\n     In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of\n     interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now\n     familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors\n     and other snow vehicles parked alongside the\n     structures.\n\n     RESUME MULDER\n\n     Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his\n     deep jacket pockets. Training them on:\n\n     THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE\n\n     PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no\n     sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building,\n     finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW\n     TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice\n     station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one\n     of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the\n     vehicle and getting in.\n\n     The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back\n     away from the ice station.\n\n     CLOSE ON MULDER\n\n     Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The\n     excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing,\n     which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises,\n     beginning to move the still great distance between\n     himself and the ice station.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     WIDE ON SCREEN\n\n     Mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the\n     domed tents.\n\n\n     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER'S FEET\n\n     Moving cautiously, and with effort on the snowscape\n     crust. CAMERA RISING up to Mulder's face, determined and\n     watchful.\n\n\n     FOLLOWING MULDER\n\n     The ice station still several hundred yards in the\n     distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME,\n     disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that\n     just moments earlier had been stable footing.\n\n                                             HARD CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT. SNOW ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape\n     crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard\n     surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath,\n     somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the\n     picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over,\n     regaining his wits, and his bearings.\n\n     NEW ANGLE\n\n     Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure.\n     Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice\n     it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air\n     coming out of vents in the structure, carving out\n     corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice\n     and snow above.\n\n     CLOSER ON MULDER\n\n     rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents\n     blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his\n     jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open,\n     ungrated.\n\n     And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after\n     considering the hole he's fallen through high above him,\n     is really Mulder's only choice.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT.

UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Above a frozen ice lith, Mulder's head appears,\n     squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting. With\n     effort, Mulder slides out of the small space, using some\n     architecture above as a handhold. Pulling his legs free\n     and dropping onto the floor.\n\n     MULDER'S POV\n\n     It is dark in here, the features of the corridor\n     ill-defined.\n\n     RESUME MULDER - WIDER\n\n     Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka,\n     snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths\n     of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.\n\n     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER\n\n     Training the light down the corridor, which curves away\n     in both directions. Then pointing it at something right\n     in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.\n\n     Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the\n     lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes\n     staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is\n     dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the\n     prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie.\n     His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've\n     seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man,\n     is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.\n\n     REVERSE ON MULDER\n\n     Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the\n     corridor, his pace quickened.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA\n\n     LOW ANGLE on the great white expanse. Across which a\n     snow tractor is moving. PANNING with the vehicle to...\n\n     Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops,\n     its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.\n\n     A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again,\n     following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings\n     it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see\n     the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the\n     cabin. As we:\n\n                                             CUT BACK TO:\n\n\n     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n     MULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where\n     soft light is penetrating through several low, arched\n     openings.\n\n     Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the\n     openings.\n\n     ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY\n\n     Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony\n     passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again,\n     pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the\n     opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in\n     wonder at:\n\n\n     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON\n     A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)\n\n     Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and\n     scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see\n     him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between\n     floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony\n     passageway, which is like countless other passageways.\n     Which are actually ventilation ports.\n\n     ANGLE OVER MULDER\n\n     Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before\n     him. Looking down to the center floor where a large\n     central theater gives off a light different from\n     elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down\n     to the central theater far below are several LARGE\n     TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to\n     Mulder's position.)\n\n     ANGLE ON MULDER\n\n     Reacting to this. Then something captures his\n     attention.\n\n     MULDER'S POV\n\n     There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER\n     Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are\n     still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather\n     human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks\n     and architecture surrounding it.\n\n\n     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON\n     MULDER\n\n     looks beside him where the joint that connects two\n     sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with\n     an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to\n     slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what\n     Mulder does here.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     INT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     WIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS\n\n     Mulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down\n     past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which\n     the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the\n     same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in\n     which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods\n     are empty.\n\n     Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his\n     way around the empty cryopods.\n\n     REVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER\n\n     Creeping away from us. Heading toward:\n\n\n     INT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR\n\n     Where Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which\n     leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the\n     large stadium structure. Where:\n\n     REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR\n\n     Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on\n     a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen\n     within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But\n     these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a\n     confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen\n     alive. They are slowly tracking.\n\n     Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen\n     humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having\n     sensed:\n\n     NEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD\n\n     PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and\n     fear he's experiencing, on seeing:\n\n     CAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE\n\n     Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features\n     hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue\n     crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent\n     Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away\n     horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.\n\n     MULDER\n\n     hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT\n     ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the\n     AMPULE.\n\n     Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle\n     poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding\n     the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of\n     the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.\n\n     And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like\n     water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out\n     from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL\n     REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this\n     substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is\n     in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end\n     RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the\n     syringe.\n\n     LOW CLOSE ANGLE\n\n     on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but\n     does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to\n     re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from\n     the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the\n     substance.\n\n\n     EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Where Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is\n     streaming out of all the ducts now.

Moving to their\n     carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.\n\n     A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a\n     rush. Heading off in various directions.\n\n     CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his\n     tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last\n     drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow.\n     He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip\n     of some emotion conflicting with duty.\n\n     The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing\n     open the door for the CSM.\n\n                            MAN WHO SHOT MULDER\n               C'mon.

And the vehicle pulls away as we:\n\n                                             CUT BACK TO:\n\n\n     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - AGENT MULDER\n\n     Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle\n     blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then\n     finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner\n     slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that\n     exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted\n     liquid drains from her mouth and nose.

Moving on top of her now, and pumping\n     forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her.\n     One - two - three.\n\n     And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing\n     his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he\n     is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to\n     strain.

It is still partially\n     full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to\n     use it when --\n\n     -- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath\n     him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm.\n     Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully\n     coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus\n     on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief.

His hands under\n     her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a\n     rolled carpet into the rafters.\n\n\n     RESUME SCULLY\n\n     Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious,\n     but somehow able to manage herself forward.\n\n\n     RESUME MULDER\n\n     Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up\n     to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and\n     lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice --\n     where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS\n     from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out\n     of the ice where they have broken through the host.\n     Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's\n     face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly\n     flesh.\n\n     Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free\n     himself from it getting a grip.\n\n     As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the\n     creature which he cannot see beneath him.\n\n\n     RESUME CREATURE\n\n     As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING\n     at Mulder's legs with its claws.

ACRES OF CORN - MAGIC HOUR\n\n     TRACKING LOW WITH MEN IN FATIGUES, moving along the\n     perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn\n     stalks with small handheld butane burners.

FBI FIELD OFFICE - DALLAS - NIGHT\n\n     The large room filled with the evidence and debris from\n     the bombing. It is dark. Until A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pricks\n     the blackness, moving toward us into f.g. Carried by the\n     man we now recognize as The Man Who Shot Mulder. He\n     moves with directness, purpose. Finding what he's\n     looking for amid the cataloged material, he finds on a\n     work bench. Next to the microscope Scully had used. It\n     is the BONE FRAGMENTS, held in an evidence container.\n\n     He pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he\n     entered.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n     EXT.

We hold on this shot, PRELAPPING the sound\n     of:\n\n                            JANA CASSIDY'S VOICE\n               ... in light of the report I've got\n               before me; in light of the narrative\n               I'm now hearing...\n\n\n     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY\n\n     Jana Cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when\n     we first met her.\n\n     She is flanked by the other members of the review board,\n     including A.D. Skinner who sits at the end of the\n     table.\n\n     Cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before\n     she continues. Looking up with consternation as she\n     resumes.\n\n                            CASSIDY\n               ... my official report is incomplete\n               pending these new facts I'm being\n               asked to reconcile. Agent Scully...\n\n     AGENT SCULLY\n\n     Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat\n     next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the\n     signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her\n     expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes\n     are filled of dark, restrained defiance.\n\n                            CASSIDY\n               ...while there is direct evidence now\n               that a federal agent may have been\n               involved in the bombing... the other\n               events you've laid down here seem too\n               incredible on their own, and quite\n               frankly implausible in their\n               connection.\n\n     PANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like\n     Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               What is it you find incredible?\n\n                            CASSIDY\n               Well...where would you like me to\n               start? Antarctica is a long way from\n               Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very\n               well submit a report to the Attorney\n               General that alleges the links you've\n               made here. Bees and corn crops do not\n               quite fall under the rubric of\n               domestic terrorism.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               No, they don't.\n\n                            CASSIDY\n               Most of what I find in here is lacking\n               a coherent picture of an organization\n               with an attributable motive. I realize\n               you're very lucky to be alive Agent\n               Scully. The ordeal you've endured has\n               clearly affected you -- though the\n               holes in your account leave this panel\n               with little choice but to delete these\n               references from our final report to\n               the Justice Department. Until which\n               time hard evidence becomes available\n               that would give us cause to pursue\n               such an investigation.\n\n     Scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving\n     around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing\n     something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A\n     small vial.\n\n                            SCULLY\n               I don't believe the FBI currently has\n               an investigation unit qualified to\n               pursue the evidence in hand.\n\n     Cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this\n     vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as\n     Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission,\n     no further adieu.\n\n     ANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER\n\n     Watching Scully exit.\n\n                            CASSIDY (O.S.)\n               Mr. Skinner....?\n\n     CAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him.\n\n                           CASSIDY\n               Please ask Agent Scully to come back\n               to this hearing. We're not quite\n               finished.\n\n     As Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this\n     directive, we:\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY\n\n     We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in\n     the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder\n     sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There\n     is no one else around.\n\n     Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through\n     the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park\n     bench.\n\n     CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN\n\n     They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension\n     as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling,\n     exhaling. Then:\n\n                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN\n               Congratulations on your survival.

The\n     CSM rising, watching him.\n\n     As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent\n     Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM\n     watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken\n     restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder\n     takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM\n     standing alone in the distance. As we:\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n     EXT. CORN FIELDS/WHITE DOMES - TUNISIA - DAY\n\n     TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET\n\n     The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize\n     shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy\n     ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And\n     that the person we are tracking with is passing row\n     after row of stalks.\n\n     CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS\n\n     REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He\n     is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose.\n     Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn\n     where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his\n     way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently\n     as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of\n     paper.\n\n     Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance\n     reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight\n     narrowing of his eyes.\n\n     He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in\n     Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the\n     Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.\n\n     Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper\n     slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row\n     in which he approached.\n\n     CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on\n     which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we\n     cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE\n     ADVISE. STOP.\n\n     CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we\n     can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to\n     reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we\n     had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian\n     Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the\n     distant horizon.\n\n     Off this image we FADE OUT.\n\n                             THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Files: Fight the Future, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Chris Carter\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:39:05.905929"}
