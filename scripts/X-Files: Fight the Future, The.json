SNOWSCAPE\n</b>\n     A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous\n     low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19\"\n     television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO\n     BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a\n     distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see\n     that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice\n     sheet in an otherwise featureless land.\n\n     A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.\n\n\n<b>     CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN\n</b>\n     Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are\n     dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we\n     squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting\n     foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They\n     continue toward us, the wind beating against them,\n     CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before\n     them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.\n\n\n<b>     FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES\n</b>\n     As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in\n     the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the\n     men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their\n     quarry.\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>     INT. ICE CAVE\n</b>\n     Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the\n     thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the\n     Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The\n     sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,\n     illuminating their faces. And:\n\n<b>     A CREATURE\n</b>\n     Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We\n     get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,\n     seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,\n     dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves\n     quickly enough away that any other identifying feature\n     is lost in the deeper shadows.\n\n<b>     THE PRIMITIVES\n</b>\n     Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under\n     their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the\n     constricting cavern, giving chase.\n\n     Following them as they moves with animal-like agility\n     through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their\n     torchlight catching:\n\n<b>     THE CREATURE\n</b>\n     As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller\n     crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives\n     entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.\n     The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,\n     pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.\n     Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on\n     the run.\n\n\n<b>     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN\n</b>\n     The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead\n     man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what\n     appears to be a box cavern.\n\n<b>     CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE\n</b>\n     Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch\n     illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead\n     Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does\n     finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's\n<b>     ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.\n</b>\n     The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is\n     difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature\n     squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn\n     to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:\n\n<b>     THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN\n</b>\n     Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body\n     of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is\n     driven away into the shadows.\n\n     The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his\n     hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the\n     Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are\n     covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the\n     First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.\n\n     The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,\n     stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has\n     collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first\n     time, on its face.\n\n     When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.\n     But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and\n     dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong\n     hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the\n     Creature's eye.\n\n\n<b>     LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE\n</b>\n     The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the\n     dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the\n     oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As\n     if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling\n     into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.\n\n\n<b>     ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE\n</b>\n     Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the\n     fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have\n     spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his\n     eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.\n\n     Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES\n     UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the\n     cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY\n     with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and\n     silence. But only for a moment. Until:\n\n\n<b>     SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT\n</b><b>     DAY\n</b>\n     Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the\n     earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes\n     and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST\n     CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of\n     the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained\n<b>     GASPING.\n</b>\n     Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS\n     of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot\n     sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward\n     in time.\n\n<b>                            2ND BOY\n</b>               Hey, Stevie. You okay?\n\n\n<b>     INT.

Anything?\n\n<b>     OVER THE BOYS ABOVE\n</b>\n     Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of\n     sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then\n     reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:\n\n<b>                            STEVIE\n</b>               Human skull.\n\n     One side partially missing from the cranium.

It is\n     milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow\n     glassy in places. Then:\n\n<b>                            STEVIE\n</b>               Anyways, there's bones all over the\n               place down here.\n\n     Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK\n     DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And\n     something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,\n     standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is\n     climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over\n     the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then\n     the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard\n     floor of the cave.\n\n<b>     CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES\n</b>\n     Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting\n     aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED\n     by a shivering seizure of some kind.\n\n     CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they\n     move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his\n     bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to\n     Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.\n     Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the\n     wind was knocked out of him.\n\n<b>                            3RD BOY (O.S.)\n</b>               Hey, Stevie....\n\n     But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to\n     the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes\n     go wide.\n\n<b>                            2ND BOY\n</b>               You okay?\n\n     But what they see next answers that question for them.\n\n<b>     THEIR POV OF STEVIE\n</b>\n     His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.\n     Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK\n     OIL.

Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT\n     (five floorplans to choose from, including the model\n     home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND\n     appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.\n\n     CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the\n     surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the\n     distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.\n\n     As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing\n     but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the\n     landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.\n\n\n<b>     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY\n</b>\n     Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling\n     into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING.

As the 2ND FIREMAN\n     drops down next to him.

Looking\n     at:\n\n<b>     A MED-EVAC CHOPPER\n</b>\n     Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at\n     high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the\n     neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just\n     over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard\n     scrabble.\n\n     The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE\n     PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA\n     PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The\n     Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire\n     Captain watches this, then stares toward --\n\n     DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the\n     chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him\n     in route.\n\n<b>                            BRONSCHWEIG\n</b>                      (over the chopper)\n               Keep those people back.

He's\n     making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie\n     is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed\n     QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.\n     Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good\n     look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.\n\n<b>     ANGLE ON CHOPPER\n</b>\n     As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid\n     shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes\n     flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop\n     wash blowing:\n\n<b>     DR. BRONSCHWEIG\n</b>\n     And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper\n     bank away, then turns his look to:\n\n<b>     THE NEIGHBORHOOD\n</b>\n     Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are\n     rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks\n     like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE\n     UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS.

Leaving the Captain to wonder what\n     the hell's going on. Watching the first of many\n     REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel\n     carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.\n     Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.\n\n     HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The\n     sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing\n     we are:\n\n\n<b>     EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY\n</b>\n     The chopper is banking over the side of the building,\n     preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI\n     AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND\n     appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK\n<b>     LATER.\n</b>\n     The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is\n     thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT\n<b>     IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.\n</b>\n     Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,\n     approaching the waiting FBI Agents.

Who turns back to his charges, Michaud\n     does not register this attitude, though. Something else\n     has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the\n     edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what\n     he sees now.\n\n     On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI\n     AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof.

Mulder stares hard\n     out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there\n     is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog\n     from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing\n     but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then\n     reaching for the door latch.\n\n<b>     RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR\n</b>\n     Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the\n     snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device\n     held before him. In this forbidding environment he might\n     as well be taking a space walk -- without the security\n     of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his\n     tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the\n     distance between himself and the snow tractor.\n\n<b>     MOVING WITH MULDER\n</b>\n     Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.\n     Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something\n     now which allows him to pocket the GPS device.
