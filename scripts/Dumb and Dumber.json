The Young Woman stares at\nher reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all\nabout.\n\nFinally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD\nCHRISTMAS, age 30.

MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY\nThis building is white with black spots on it, like a\nDALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a\nDOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.\n\nThe vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs\nhanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout\non the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.\n\nHARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in\na ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY\nEARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm\nof DOGS pile out.\n\n                        HARRY\n            Okay, gang, single file.

EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY\n\nLloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined\ndriveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE\nSTONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the\nfront oor and RINGS THE BELL.\n\nThe double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON\nappears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when\nhe lays eyes on her.\n\n                      MARY\n          Hello.\n              (beat)\n          I'll be just a minute...\n\n                                                          4.\n\nAs Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of\nBinaca.

LIMO - DAY\n\nLloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the\nwindow, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on\nher lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps\nglancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he\nis speechless. Then:\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Why you going to the airport? Flying\n          somewhere?\n\n                      MARY\n              (dead-pan)\n          How'd you guess?\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Well, I saw your luggage, then when\n          I noticed the airline ticket, I put\n          two and two together.\n              (beat)\n          So where you heading?\n\n                      MARY\n          Aspen.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear\n          California's beautiful this time of\n          year.\nMary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another\nglance.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.\n\n                      MARY\n          I'm Mary.\n\nON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate\nto impress her.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.\n          It's only temporary.\n\n                                                         5.\n\n                         MARY\n          Oh?\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I\n          are saving up our money so we can\n          open our own pet store.\n\n                         MARY\n          That's nice.\n\n                       LLOYD\n              (smiling)\n          I got worms.\n\n                      MARY\n          I beg your pardon?\n\n                      LLOYD\n          That's what we're gonna call it: I\n          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in\n          selling worm farms you know, like\n          ant farms. A lot of people don't\n          realize that worms make much better\n          pets than ants. They're quiet,\n          affectionate, they don't bite, and\n          they're super with the kids.\n\n                      MARY\n          Aren't ants quiet, too?\n\nLloyd realizes she has a point.\n\n                        LLOYD\n          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half\n          as affectionate. And if you cut an\n          ant's head off, it won't grow back.\n\n                         MARY\n          I see.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          And best of all, worm farming is a\n          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year\n          industry. I wouldn't mind having a\n          piece of that pie, if you know what\n          I mean.\n\nTo her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks\nat her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's\nconcerned about something.\n\n                                                            6.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          What's the matter? Little tense about\n          the flight?\n\n                      MARY\n              (beat)\n          Something like that.\n\nLloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          It's really nothing to worry about,\n          Mary. Statistically, they say you're\n          more likely to get killed on the way\n          to the airport. You know, like in a\n          head-on crash, or something.\n\n                      MARY\n          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your\n          eyes on the road.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Good thinking. There's a lot of bad\n          rivers out there.\n\nLloyd turns back to the steering wheel.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\nEXT. AIRPORT - DAY\n\nLloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk\nand turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she\nreaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.\n\n                         MARY\n          Here you go.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Keep it. It was my pleasure.\n\nFor the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This\nmakes her more lovely than ever.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and\n          pass out. You'll be there before you\n          know it.\n\n                      MARY\n          Thanks Lloyd.\n              (beat)\n          And good luck with your worms.\n\n                                                            7.\n\nThen she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,\nfollowed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,\nENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.\n\nAfterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a\nmoment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He\njust drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.\nThere's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE\nOFFICER standing there.\n\n                      POLICE OFFICER\n          Come on, move it, you're in a red\n          zone.\n\nLloyd starts the limo and pulls away.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY\n\nMary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of\ntravelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are\nfocused straight ahead.\n\nShe passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in\nan ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.\n\n                       ARMANI SUIT\n          She's gonna leave the briefcase at\n          the foot of the escalator. You make\n          the pick-up.\n\n                      PLAID SPORTCOAT\n          Piece of cake.\n\nEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY\nAs Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport\nwindow and SEES MARY\n\nWALKING ALONG.\n\nWhen she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.\nShe puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for\nher ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He\nturns to see a car irectly behind him.\n\n                      LLOYD\n              (to car's driver)\n          Drive around me, you pinhead!\n\nWhen he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees\nthat SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF\nTHE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.\n\n                                                           8.\n\nHe pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He\nstarts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police\nOfficer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and\ndragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.\n\nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL\n\nThe Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to\napproach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching\nfor the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP\nTHE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at\neach other, dumbstruck.\n\nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE\n\nLloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post\nthe departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion\nof numbers.\n\n                        LLOYD\n          Damn!\n\nQUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he\nwatches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.\n\nEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY\n\nLloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who\nFOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk\nwhen suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.\n\nHIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision\nof the Police Officer.\n\nHe takes off after it, but to no avail.\n                      LLOYD\n          You can't do this! I'll lose my job!\n\nAs Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his\nfingers through his hair.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON\n\nWe see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A\ndejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up\nand drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's\nbriefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.\nThey disappear inside without acknowledging each other.\n\n                                                            9.\n\nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up\nand parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.\nThey are J.P.

APARTMENT CORRIDOR\n\nLloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently\ntoward the door of their apartment.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM\n\nLloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they\nboth plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still\nhas the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,\ntweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.\n\nThe place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The\ncarpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a\nminiature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt\nand worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture\nwith stuffing spilling out of the gashes.\n\n                       HARRY\n           I got fired again.\n\nLloyd shakes his head.\n\n                       LLOYD\n           I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but\n           let's face it, you are one pathetic\n           loser.

I was wondering why you had\n           those bindings put on them.\n\nLloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.\n\n                       LLOYD\n           Where'd this come from?\n\n                        HARRY\n               (sheepishly)\n           I bought it.\n\n                       LLOYD\n           What for?\n\n                                                        79.\n\n                        HARRY\n          I like the feel of it against my\n          skin...\n                (defensive)\n          ...I mean, you know, when a woman's\n          wearing it.\n\nLloyd inspects it more closely.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Harry, how many women do you know\n          who wear a size XXL?\n\n                      HARRY\n          Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.\n          I'm supposed to have a few\n          eccentricities.\n\nThere's a KNOCK on the door.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Enter, parlez vous!\n\nThe Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket\nand a newspaper under his arm.\n\n                      BARNARD\n          I brought you your newspaper and\n          some champagne, gentlemen.\n          Unfortunately, we didn't seem to\n          have the, um, label you requested.\n\nLloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          All out of Boone's Farm, huh?\n                      BARNARD\n          You have a rapier wit, sir. I took\n          the liberty of bringing a comparable\n          substitute: Dom Perignon.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?\n\nLloyd smiles and over tips him.\n\n                      BARNARD\n          Thank you so much, sir.\n\nHe puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads\nfor the door.\n\n                                                         80.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense\n          with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,\n          Barney, we're all from the     same mold.\n              (winks)\n          We just have a little more     dough\n          than you right now.\n\nBarnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He\npicks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,\nsending out a resonant RING.\n\n                      HARRY\n          Cocktail hour has commenced!\n\nHe starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins\nthumbing through the newspaper.\n\n                      HARRY (CONT'D)\n          Hey, later on what do you say we...?\n\nHe notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something\nhe's found in the paper.\n\n                        HARRY (CONT'D)\n          Lloyd... you okay?\n\n                      LLOYD\n              (dumbstruck)\n          Harry, it's her.\n\n                       HARRY\n          Who?\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Mary with the briefcase. This is\n          her...\n\nHe shoves the newspaper at Harry.\n\nCLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST\nPRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath\nthis is a photograph of Mary with her parents.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          Mary Swanson...\n\n                      HARRY\n          Come on, Cinderella, it's time to\n          get you ready for the ball...\n\nRoy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman\" plays over a...\n\nMONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:\n\n                                                          81.\n\n-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.\n\n-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The\nATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both\nguys' hair in curlers.\n\n-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.\nSuddenly Lloyd grabs his neck\n\nas if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his\nfingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd\nLAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in\nhis hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.\n\n-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to\nthe floor to reveal a PILE OF\n\nNOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.\n\n-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN\nOVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard\nHughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety\ngoggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric\nsander.\n\n-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a\nmassage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred\ndollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and\nWHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.\n\n-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with\nher shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.\n\n-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out\nof the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He\ncouldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,\nbut Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.\n\n-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman\nlooks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.\n\n-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE\nTUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks\nsickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.\n\nPAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive\nJ.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND\nLLOYD.\n\n                                                  DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                                           82.\n\nEXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT\n\nThrongs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering\nthe building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and\nLloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue\ntuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.\n(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse\nstops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred\ndollars.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Thanks for the lift, Barney.\n\nINT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY\n\nNicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when\nHarry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them\nthe once over.\n\n                      ANDRE\n          Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a\n          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.\n\nHarry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd\ntakes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels\n\noff TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          This should cover a couple plates.\n\n                      HARRY\n          I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if\n          we want seconds?\n\nLloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.\n                      LLOYD\n          Put us down for four plates, my good\n          man.\n\nThey ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate\nJ.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.\n\n                      J.P. SHAY\n              (WHISPERING)\n          Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.\n\nBACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through\nthe affluent crowd.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          I'm getting nervous, Harry.\n\n                                                        83.\n\n                      HARRY\n          relax, Lloyd. These people are just\n          like you and me.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          What are you talking about? They're\n          educated, well-bred, charming, and\n          sophisticated.\n\n                      HARRY\n          So what? We can be sophistica holy\n          shit, would you look at the fun bags\n          on that hose hound.\n\nHe points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.\nLloyd rolls his eyes.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm\n          already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't\n          like me?\n\n                      HARRY\n          Look, let's just go saddle up to the\n          bar and down a couple bowls of\n          loudmouth soup. A little booze'll\n          bring back that old Lloyd Christmas\n          over-confidence.\n\nThe guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they\nmake their way to the bar.\n\n                      LLOYD\n              (to BARTENDER)\n          Two martinis, straight up.\nAs Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL\nRED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then\nwalks away.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          Shut up, Harry.\n\n                      HARRY\n          I didn't say anything.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Yeah, well I know what you were gonna\n          say and I'm telling you to shut up\n          in advance.\n\n                      HARRY\n          How do you know what I was gonna\n          say?\n\n                                                        84.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          I read you like a book.\n\n                      HARRY\n          Okay, if you read me like a book\n          then what was I gonna say?\n\n                      LLOYD\n          You were gonna say:\n              (in Harry's looped\n               VOICE)\n          'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't\n          mind roasting my weenie in.'\n\nHarry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.\n\n                       LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          And I would say 'shut up', because\n          this is our chance to get in with\n          the rich and powerful and you don't\n          ingratiate yourself to the kind of\n          people by acting like Ron Jeremy on\n          Spanish Fly.\n\nThe Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.\nCLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to\n\nsee Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a\nLARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and\nElizabeth Swanson.\n\n                      ANDRE\n          If I could have your attention,\n          please...\n\nThe crowd QUIETS.\n                      ANDRE (CONT'D)\n          I'd like to thank you all for coming\n          to this very special event.

SWANSON\n          Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the\n          Icelandic Snow Owl.\n\nHe pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE\nOWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.\n\n                      MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)\n          These magnificent specimens were\n\nRESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-\n\nyear, two-million-dollar effort on our part.

Oh, and feel free to take a\n          closer look at our new friends here.\n          Enjoy.\n\nThe crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns\nback to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Two more, please.\n\nHarry stares at Lloyd with concern.\n\n                      HARRY\n          Lloyd, I've never seen you this\n          uptight. You've gotta chill out.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          I can't help it. This is a very\n          important night for me.\n                      (MORE)\n\n                                                        86.\n\n                       LLOYD (CONT'D)\n              (beat)\n          Harry, have you ever wondered why\n          you and I never have long-term\n          girlfriends?\n\n                      HARRY\n          What are you talking about? I went\n          out with Fraida Felcher for two and\n          a half weeks.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          That was a fluke.\n              (beat)\n          The reason we never have long-term\n          girlfriends is because of one thing:\n          We're afraid of the C word.\n\n                      HARRY\n          That's crazy. We live for the C word.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          I'm talking bout commitment.\n\n                         HARRY\n                (beat)\n          Oh.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.\n          The first time I laid eyes on Mary\n          Swanson, I knew she was the one.\n              (beat)\n          Some things you feel in your heart,\n          other things you feel in your groin.\n          This girl makes me feel it all in\n          the heart.\n\nSuddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.\n\nHIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE\nOF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A\n\nspectacular black cocktail dress.\n\nLloyd quickly turns toward the bar.\n\n                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n          Oh shit, there she is.\n\n                                                   87.\n\n                      HARRY\n              (checking her out)\n          Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.\n          She's an angel.\n              (beat)\n          Well, what are you waiting for? Get\n          over there and talk to her.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          She's gonna think I'm some kind of\n          psycho when she realizes how far I\n          came just to see her.\n\n                      HARRY\n          You have her briefcase she's gonna\n          be thrilled to see you.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          And then what? She'll take it back\n          and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.\n\nHarry thinks about this a moment.\n\n                      HARRY\n          Look, man, you just drove two thousand\n          miles to see this girl. Don't quit\n          on the last fifty feet.\n\n                       LLOYD\n               (brightening)\n          Wait a second, I have an idea. You\n          go over and introduce yourself. That\n          way you can build me up so when I\n          come along I won't have to brag about\n          myself. Tell her I'm good-looking\n          and I'm rich and I have a rapist's\n          wit.\n\n                      HARRY\n          I can't tell her you're good looking,\n          Lloyd she's got eyes.\n\nLloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          Please Harry, I'm appealing to you\n          as one loser to another. Just build\n          me up and then give me a signal to\n          come over. Please.\n\nHarry SIGHS.\n\n                                                           88.\n\n                      HARRY\n          All right. But you're gonna owe me a\n          big one for this.\n\nHarry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES\nMary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.\n\n                      HARRY (CONT'D)\n          Nice set of hooters you got there.\n\nMary turns to Harry, stunned.\n\n                      MARY\n          I beg your pardon?\n\n                      HARRY\n          The owls.

I'm sure we'll find a trailer\n          camp somewhere to call home.\n\n                      BARNARD\n          Why not right here?\n\nHarry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.\n\n                      LLOYD\n          This joint is a little out of our\n          budget, Barney.\n\n                      BARNARD\n              (smiling)\n          Oh, I think we might be able to find\n          you a free room somewhere -- after\n          all, like you once told me, we're\n          all from the same mold.\n              (winks)\n          You just don't have any dough right\n          now.\n\nThe guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.\n\n                      HARRY\n          Are you on the level?\n\n                      BARNARD\n          Absolutely. We'll just slide you\n          into one of the employee rooms...\n\nThe guys beam at this.\n\n                      BARNARD (CONT'D)\n          ...Provided, of course, you don't\n          mind working one or two afternoons a\n          week.\n\nHarry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:\n\n                      LLOYD\n          You know what, Barney, I think we'll\n          take out chances down the road.\n\nBarnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their\nhearse and drive off.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nAs the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:\n\n                                                       119.\n\n                      HARRY\n              (v.o.)\n          Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,\n          what next, lloyd?\n\n                      LLOYD\n              (v.o.)\n          I say we head due south and try a\n          little nose-rubbing with some of\n          them slinky eskimo babes.\n\n                      HARRY\n              (v.o.)\n          Now you're talking my language.
