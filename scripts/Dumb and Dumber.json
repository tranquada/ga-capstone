The Young Woman stares at\nher reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all\nabout.\n\nFinally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD\nCHRISTMAS, age 30.

MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.\n\nHARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in\na ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY\nEARS.

We're gonna specialize in\n          selling worm farms you know, like\n          ant farms. A lot of people don't\n          realize that worms make much better\n          pets than ants. They're quiet,\n          affectionate, they don't bite, and\n          they're super with the kids.\n\n<b>                      MARY\n</b>          Aren't ants quiet, too?\n\nLloyd realizes she has a point.\n\n<b>                        LLOYD\n</b>          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half\n          as affectionate.

I wouldn't mind having a\n          piece of that pie, if you know what\n          I mean.\n\nTo her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks\nat her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's\nconcerned about something.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                            6.\n</b>\n<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)\n</b>          What's the matter?

Statistically, they say you're\n          more likely to get killed on the way\n          to the airport. You know, like in a\n          head-on crash, or something.\n\n<b>                      MARY\n</b>          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your\n          eyes on the road.\n\n<b>                      LLOYD\n</b>          Good thinking.

Lloyd watches her,\nENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.\n\nAfterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a\nmoment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He\njust drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.\nThere's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE\nOFFICER standing there.\n\n<b>                      POLICE OFFICER\n</b>          Come on, move it, you're in a red\n          zone.\n\nLloyd starts the limo and pulls away.\n\n<b>                                                      CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are\nfocused straight ahead.\n\nShe passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in\nan ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.\n\n<b>                       ARMANI SUIT\n</b>          She's gonna leave the briefcase at\n          the foot of the escalator.

Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He\nturns to see a car irectly behind him.\n\n<b>                      LLOYD\n</b>              (to car's driver)\n          Drive around me, you pinhead!\n\nWhen he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees\nthat SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF\nTHE STAIRS.

He\nstarts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police\nOfficer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and\ndragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.\n\n<b>INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL\n</b>\nThe Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to\napproach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching\nfor the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP\nTHE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at\neach other, dumbstruck.\n\n<b>INT.

Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,\ntweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.\n\nThe place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The\ncarpet is threadbare and filthy.

The\nATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both\nguys' hair in curlers.\n\n-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.\nSuddenly Lloyd grabs his neck\n\nas if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his\nfingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd\nLAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in\nhis hand.

PAN\nOVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard\nHughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety\ngoggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric\nsander.\n\n-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a\nmassage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred\ndollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and\nWHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.\n\n-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with\nher shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.\n\n-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out\nof the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He\ncouldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,\nbut Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.\n\n-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman\nlooks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.\n\n-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE\nTUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS.
