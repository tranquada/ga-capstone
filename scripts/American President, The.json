Tell them\n\t\tthe President resents the implication\n\t\tthat he's turned his back on the\n\t\tenvironment. Tell them I'll send 455 to\n\t\tthe floor. But we're gonna ask for a\n\t\t10 percent reduction. If they want to pull\n\t\ttheir support, fine. At 63 percent job\n\t\tapproval rating. I don't need their help\n\t\tgetting a bill passed. We gotta get going--\n\t\twhere's Leon?\n\n\t\t\t\tA.J.\n\t\t\t   (to an AIDE)\n\t\tWould you call Mr. Kodak and tell him\n\t\tthe President's--\n\n\tA.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on\n\tpedestrian collision in the outer office--\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.

The White House\n\tpollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along\n\twith A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's\n\tStarting Team.

First, I wanted to say\n\t\tcongratulations. Three years ago, we\n\t\twere elected to the White House by\n\t\tone of the narrowest margins in history,\n\t\tand today Kodak tells us 63 percent of\n\t\tregistered voters think we're doing a\n\t\tgood job.\n\n\t\t\t\tKODAK\n\t\tWait a second. You wanted me to poll\n\t\tregistered voters?\n\n\tEveryone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tBut the poll also tells us what we\n\t\talready knew: We don't get this\n\t\tcrime bill of ours through Congress\n\t\tand these numbers are gonna be a\n\t\tmemory. So, starting today, we're\n\t\tshifting it into gear.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBIN\n\t\tCan I tell my morning press gaggle\n\t\tthat gun control--\n\n\t\t\t\tA.J.\n\t\tCrime control, Robin.

For\n\t\treasons passing understanding, people\n\t\tdo not relate guns to gun-related crime.\n\n\t\t\t\tA.J.\n\t\tRobin, you can brief the press this\n\t\tafternoon.

Let's make\n\t\tit the issue. Let's try something\n\t\tnew, 'cause I know that most couples,\n\t\twhen they're first getting together,\n\t\tare inclined to slam on the brakes\n\t\tbecause they're concerned about Bob\n\t\tRumson's drool.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tYou're not most people.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tYou know what your problem is?\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tWhat's my problem?\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tSex and nervousness.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tSex and nervousness is my problem.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tYes. Last night when we were\n\t\tlooking at the different place\n\t\tsettings in the dish room, I\n\t\trealized that those place settings\n\t\twere provided by the First Ladies.\n\t\tAnd I'll bet none of those First\n\t\tLadies were nervous about having\n\t\tsex with their President husbands.\n\t\tAnd you know why?\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tNo, but I'm sure you'll explain it\n\t\tto me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tI will. Because they weren't\n\t\tpresidents when they met them. Not\n\t\tthe case here.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tAhhhhhh.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tYou see what I'm getting at?\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tYes. May I use your bathroom for a\n\t\tmoment?\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tSure. It's right through there.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tI want to freshen up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tAs you pass through, you'll see a\n\t\tlarge closet on your left. And if\n\t\tyou feel comfortable, hang up your\n\t\tcoat, and when you come back I'll\n\t\thave fixed up a drink, we'll sit on\n\t\tthe couch, and I will explain to\n\t\tyou my plan.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tYou have a plan? Don't make me\n\t\twait. You're on a roll.\n\n\tSYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.\n\tSHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a\n\tcouple of drinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (speaking up)\n\t\tOkay. You're attracted to me, but\n\t\tthe idea of physical intimacy is\n\t\tuncomfortable because you only know\n\t\tme as the President. It's not always\n\t\tgonna be that way, and the reason I\n\t\tknow that is because there was a\n\t\tmoment last night when you were with\n\t\tme and not the President, and I know\n\t\twhat a big step that was for you.\n\t\tSo, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's\n\t\tmy plan: We're gonna slow down.\n\t\tWhen you're comfortable, that's\n\t\twhen it'll happen.\n\n\tSYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of\n\tSHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tPerhaps I didn't properly explain\n\t\tthe fundamentals of the \"Slow Down\"\n\t\tplan.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tYou explained it great.\n\n\tShe moves closer to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (pause)\n\t\tAre you nervous?\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tGood. My nervousness exists on\n\t\tseveral levels. Number 1 -- and\n\t\tthis is in no particular order --\n\t\tI haven't done this in a pretty\n\t\tlong time. Number 2: Any expectations\n\t\tyou might have, due to the fact that\n\t\tI'm, you know...\n\n\t\t\t\tSYDNEY\n\t\tThe most powerful man in the world?\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tExactly, thank you. Just so you\n\t\tremember that's a political\n\t\tdistinction that comes with the\n\t\toffice. I mean, if Eisenhower were\n\t\there instead of me he'd be dead by\n\t\tnow.

I don't care why\n\t\tyou're not happy in social studies.\n\t\tI care about why you're not talking\n\t\tto me about why you're not happy in\n\t\tsocial studies.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tDad, I'm perfectly--\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tYou're not perfectly happy. You\n\t\tdon't think I know when something's\n\t\tbothering you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tDamnit, Dad!\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tHey!\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tYou know--\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tTalk to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tLook--\n\n\tLUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.\n\tShe's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in\n\ther life--\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\t--sometimes when you talk, you say\n\t\tthings I disagree with.\n\n\tSHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tAlmost every time I talk, I say\n\t\tthings you disagree with.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tI mean politically.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (pause)\n\t\tPolitically?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (pause)\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\tIt just starts spilling out in a stream--\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tYes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,\n\t\tI'm not sure. You know a lot more\n\t\tthan I do -- but still, I have these\n\t\tfeelings, and I don't think they're\n\t\twrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm\n\t\tnot so sure it's all right to burn a\n\t\tflag. I mean, it really bothers a lot\n\t\tof people, and I don't know why you\n\t\tthink it's okay. I hear Senator\n\t\tRumson talk, and some of the things\n\t\the says sounds right to me, and I\n\t\tthink, \"God, am I like Bob Rumson?!\n\t\tI mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad\n\t\thates this guy!\n\t\tWhy am I agreeing with him\" And then\n\t\tI think, \"Well, maybe I'm not really\n\t\tlike Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not\n\t\tlike Dad either.\" But the point is\n\t\tI'm the President's kid, and people\n\t\tpay attention to what I say, and if\n\t\tI say something different from what\n\t\tyou say, it'll be embarrassing for\n\t\tyou. So I can't just get up in social\n\t\tstudies class and say whatever I want.\n\n\tSHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely\n\tno idea...\n\n\tHe stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know\n\twhat's coming...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (quietly)\n\t\tStand up please.\n\n\tLUCY gets up slowly...\n\n\tShe's never seen her father like this...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tI want you to pay very close\n\t\tattention to what happens now.\n\n\tSHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,\n\tand gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and\n\tholds her in a tight embrace...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tIn your  lifetime, you will never\n\t\tembarrass me. It could never happen.\n\t\tYou're not the President's daughter,\n\t\tLucy, you're mine.\n\t\tAnd no one's gonna vote me out of\n\t\tthat job. You're my daughter, and\n\t\teverything else is a distant second.\n\t\t\t   (more)\n\t\tSchool is for you, Lucy. You say\n\t\twhat you want. The only thing you\n\t\thave to do to make me happy is\n\t\tcome home at the end of the day.\n\n\tLUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a\n\tlong moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tOne more thing. I don't dislike\n\t\tSenator Rumson because of his\n\t\tpolitical views. And even if you\n\t\tvoted for everything he would vote\n\t\tfor, that wouldn't make you like him.\n\t\tThere's a fundamental difference\n\tbetween you and the Bob Rumsons of\n\t\tthe world.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tThe difference is that he says he\n\t\tloves America. Saying you love\n\t\tAmerica is easy. What takes\n\t\tcharacter -- and this is what you\n\t\thave--\n\n\tSHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tWhat takes character is loving\n\t\tAmericans.\n\t\t\t   (beat)\n\n\tAnd now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the\n\tlongest trip of his life...\n\n\t...he looks over at the T.V. monitor...\"No comment\"...\n\t\"No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The\n\tWhite House isn't getting involved in...\"\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tLuce, I gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\tDad, is everything all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tEverything's fine. I'm just a little\n\t\tlate for work.\n\n\tHe heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tSomebody get my daughter some food!\n\t\tThe girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'\n\t\tout loud!\n\n\tAnd he's gone as we...\n\n\t                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.\n\n\t\t\t\tREPORTER #4\n\t\tRobin, will the President ever\n\t\trespond to Senator Rumson's\n\t\tquestion about being a member of\n\t\tthe American Civil Liberties Union?\n\n\tBut instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly\n\tstands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to\n\tthe podium.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tYes, he will. 'Morning.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBIN\n\t\tGood morning, Mr. President.\n\n\tSHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the\n\troom as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People\n\tstarts to stand.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\tThat's all right, you can keep your\n\t\tseats. For the last couple of\n\t\tmonths, Senator Rumson has suggested\n\t\tthat being president of this country\n\t\twas, to a certain extent, about\n\t\tcharacter...\n\n\tANGLE - ROBIN\n\n\twho's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in\n\tfour numbers.\n\n\tShe turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the\n\trest of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBIN\n\t\t\t   (into phone)\n\t\tLewis...call A.J. and come on down\n\t\there...I don't know, but\n\t\tsomething's happening.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t...and although I have not been\n\t\twilling to engage in his attacks on\n\t\tme, I've been here three years and\n\t\tthree days, and I can tell you\n\t\twithout hesitation: Being President\n\t\tof this country is entirely about\n\t\tcharacter.\n\n\tLEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tFor the record: Yes, I am a card-\n\t\tcarrying member of the A.C.L.U. But\n\t\tthe more important question is why\n\t\taren't you, Bob? This is an\n\t\torganization whose sole purpose is to\n\t\tdefend the Bill of Rights, so it\n\t\tnaturally begs the questions.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tWhy would a senator, his party's most\n\t\tpowerful spokesman and a candidate\n\t\tfor president, choose to reject\n\t\tupholding the Constitution? If you\n\t\tcan answer that question, then,\n\t\tfolks, you're smarter than I am,\n\t\tbecause I didn't understand it until\n\t\ta couple of minutes ago. Everybody\n\t\tknows American isn't easy. America is\n\t\tadvanced citizenship.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tYou gotta want it bad, 'cause it's\n\t\tgonna put up a fight. It's gonna\n\t\tsay, \"You want free speech? Let's\n\t\tsee you acknowledge a man whose words\n\t\tmake your blood boil, who's standing\n\t\tcenter stage and advocating, at the\n\t\ttop of his lungs, that which you\n\t\twould spend a lifetime opposing at the\n\t\ttop of yours. You want to claim\n\t\tthis land as the land of the free,\n\t\tthen the symbol of your country can't\n\t\tjust be a flag; the symbol also has\n\t\tto be one of its citizens exercising\n\t\this right to burn that flag in\n\t\tprotest.\" Show me that, defend that,\n\t\tcelebrate that in your classrooms.\n\t\tThen you can stand up and sing about\n\t\tthe land of the free. I've known Bob\n\t\tRumson for years. I've been operating\n\t\tunder the assumption that the reason\n\t\tBob devotes so much time and energy to\n\t\tshouting at the rain was that he simply\n\t\tdidn't get it. Well, I was wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tBob's problem isn't that he doesn't\n\t\tget it. Bob's problem is that he\n\t\tcan't sell it. Nobody has ever won\n\t\tan election by talking about what I\n\t\twas just talking about.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tThis is a country made up of people\n\t\twith hard jobs that they're terrified\n\t\tof losing. The roots of freedom are\n\t\tof little or no interest to them at\n\t\tthe moment. We are a nation afraid\n\t\tto go out at night. We're a society\n\t\tthat has assigned low priority to\n\t\teducation and has looked the other\n\t\tway while our public schools have\n\t\tbeen decimated. We have serious\n\t\tproblems to solve, and we need\n\t\tserious men to solve them. And\n\t\twhatever your particular problem is,\n\t\tfriend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is\n\t\tnot the least bit interested in\n\t\tsolving it. He is interested in two\n\t\tthings and two things only: Making\n\t\tyou afraid of it and telling you\n\t\twho's to blame for it. That, ladies\n\t\tand gentlemen, is how you win\n\t\telections. You gather a group of\n\t\tmiddle-aged, middle-class, middle-\n\t\tincome voters who remember with\n\t\tlonging an easier time, and you talk\n\t\tto them about family and American\n\t\tvalues and personal character. Then\n\t\tyou have an old photo of the\n\t\tPresident's girlfriend. You scream\n\t\tabout patriotism and you tell them\n\t\tshe's to blame for their lot in life,\n\t\tyou go on television and you call her\n\t\ta whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done\n\t\tnothing to you, Bob. She has done\n\t\tnothing but put herself through law\n\t\tschool, prosecute criminals for five\n\t\tyears, represent the interests of\n\t\tpublic school teachers for two years,\n\t\tand lobby for the safety of our\n\t\tnatural resources.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tYou want a character debate? Fine,\n\t\tbut you better stick with me, 'cause\n\t\tSydney Ellen Wade is way out of your\n\t\tleague. I've loved two women in my\n\t\tlife. I lost one to cancer, and I\n\t\tlost the other 'cause I was so busy\n\t\tkeeping my job I forgot to do my job.\n\t\tWell that ends right now.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHEPHERD\n\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\tTomorrow morning the White House is\n\t\tsending a bill to Congress for its\n\t\tconsideration. It's White House\n\t\tResolution 455, an energy bill\n\t\trequiring a 20 percent reduction of the\n\t\temission of fossil fuels over the\n\t\tnext ten years. It is by far the\n\t\tmost aggressive stride ever taken in\n\t\tthe fight to reverse the effects of\n\t\tglobal warming. The other piece of\n\t\tlegislation is the crime bill. As of\n\t\ttoday it no longer exists. I'm\n\t\tthrowing it out. I'm throwing it out\n\t\tand writing a law that makes sense.\n\t\tYou cannot address crime prevention\n\t\twithout getting rid of assault\n\t\tweapons and handguns.\n\t\tI consider them a threat to national\n\t\tsecurity, and I will go door to door\n\t\tif I have to, but I'm gonna convince\n\t\tAmericans that I'm right, and I'm\n\t\tgonna get the guns. We've got\n\t\tserous problems, and we need serious\n\t\tmen, and if you want to talk about\n\t\tcharacter, Bob, you'd better come at\n\t\tme with more than a burning flag and\n\t\ta membership card. If you want to\n\t\ttalk about character and American\n\t\tvalues, fine. Just tell me where and\n\t\twhen, and I'll show up. This is a\n\t\ttime for serious men, Bob, and your\n\t\tfifteen minutes are up. My name's\n\t\tAndrew Shepherd, and I am the\n\t\tPresident.\n\n\tSHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his\n\twake.\n\n\tThe MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking\n\tamong themselves, confirming that they just saw what they\n\tjust saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBIN\n\t\tAny questions?\n\n\t                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\tINT.
