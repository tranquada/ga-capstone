RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT\r\n\r\nUnderwater.\r\n\r\nShafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson\r\nRiver. The ghostly melody of \"Lili Marlene,\" the ache of the\r\nwar-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view.\r\n\r\nWe realize it is a BODY.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN (V.O.)\r\n          Some things, once you've loved\r\n          them, become yours forever.\r\n\r\nThe body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner\r\n---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome.

Dead.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN (V.O.)\r\n          And if you try to let them go...\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a breath: he comes back to life.\r\n\r\nDavid floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful,\r\nshirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water.\r\n\r\nThe scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN (V.O.)\r\n          They only circle back and return to\r\n          you.\r\n\r\nDavid's body LIFTS into the young man's arms.

You sent\r\n          him to me.\r\n\r\nAllen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.\r\n\r\nLucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two\r\nboys, two wills.

GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\nSUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.\r\n\r\nOver a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds\r\nof a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.\r\n\r\n                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          American daylight bombers were busy\r\n          again, as our liberators with\r\n          fighter escort continue the air\r\n          offensive with another sock at\r\n          German coastal installations in\r\n          France.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young\r\nman cleaning house, sweeping in the background.\r\n\r\n                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          But the Germans report a big new\r\n          red army push toward Romania. This\r\n          is World War news.\r\n\r\nAs the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We\r\nhear a groan from the young man.\r\n\r\nFrom out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,\r\nfresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of\r\nkid who takes care of everything.\r\n\r\nHe storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-\r\npaced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to\r\nthe up-beat number with his broom.\r\n\r\nThe door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his\r\nfather LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class\r\npoet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          How was she today?\r\n\r\nLouis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots\r\nthe mail in his father's hand.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          Fine. Anything for me?\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          Why? You expecting something?\r\n\r\nAllen looks down, a bad liar.\r\n                                                         4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          No.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then\r\na woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread\r\nin his face. His father just sighs.\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          I told you it wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nAllen rushes upstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\nAllen runs into a dark room, flips on the light.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          Mom?\r\n\r\nHis mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality\r\ndisorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty\r\nbathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          You've got to get me out of here.\r\n          He nailed the windows shut while I\r\n          was in the bath.\r\n\r\nShe motions to the shattered window pane across the room.\r\nAllen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape.\r\nHe moves towards her, to console her. What he's good at.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          Dad didn't do that. I nailed the\r\n          windows. Because you're not right.\r\n\r\nNaomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to\r\nher mouth.\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          Shhh...Allen. He can hear you!\r\n\r\nAllen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel.\r\n\r\n                     ALLEN\r\n          You have to rest. Clear your head.\r\n          Do you want to go back to\r\n          Greystone?\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          He wouldn't dare put me back there.\r\n                                                            5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          Then listen to me.\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          SHHHH. He can hear you!\r\n\r\nShe's losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau.\r\nHe pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          Can he still hear me?\r\n\r\nA BRAHMS WALTZ plays.\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          What did you say?\r\n\r\nAllen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness.\r\nFinally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAllen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.\r\n\r\nAs mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi\r\nclutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her\r\nsane. Because he is.\r\n\r\n                    NAOMI\r\n          Don't ever leave me.\r\n\r\nAllen, trapped, over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nFrom the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the\r\nwhole time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not\r\nwell. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home\r\nfrom down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an\r\nopen LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset.\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          Were you even going to tell me you\r\n          applied?!\r\n\r\nAllen spies the \"Columbia University\" seal on the front. He's\r\nbeen caught. He looks down, ashamed.\r\n                                                           6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ALLEN\r\n          I didn't want her to know.\r\n              (beat)\r\n          It was a dream anyway.\r\n\r\nLouis lights his own cigarette.

Go write\r\n          your own.\r\n\r\nLouis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAllen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the\r\nresponse in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face.\r\n\r\n                      ALLEN\r\n          I got in.\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          You got in?!\r\n                                                            7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALLEN\r\n          I got into Columbia University!\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS\r\n          You got into Columbia University?!\r\n\r\nAllen and his father embrace.\r\n\r\n                                                  CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY\r\n\r\nFirst day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League\r\ncampus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the\r\nlibrary like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass\r\nby. Wartime is on.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\nAllen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are\r\npatriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a\r\nroommate.\r\n\r\nHe eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't\r\nbelieve he's really here in the big city. He walks over to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAllen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich\r\nVillage.\r\n\r\n                    LUKE (O.S.)\r\n          You don't wanna go down there.\r\n\r\nHis roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia\r\nsweatshirt, leans over him.\r\n\r\n                    LUKE\r\n          Land of the fairies.

LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY\r\n\r\nThe beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler\r\nLibrary. It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years\r\nof scholarship.\r\n\r\nA pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to\r\nnew and prospective students with their families.\r\n\r\n                    TOUR GUIDE\r\n          The South Hall library is a church,\r\n          and these are the sacraments.\r\n\r\nAllen stumbles along on the tour. The tour guide points to\r\nthe contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n                    TOUR GUIDE\r\n          Original folios of the most\r\n          important texts in history.\r\n          Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The\r\n          Gutenberg Bible.\r\n\r\nAllen looks down, amazed. That's Shakespeare's handwriting.\r\n\r\n                    TOUR\r\n          These are among the University's\r\n          most prized possessions.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED\r\ncatches Allen's eye.\r\n\r\n                    LUCIEN (O.S.)\r\n          Let's hear a bit, shall we?\r\n\r\nAllen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly\r\nhandsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. He\r\nwears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful\r\ncan pull off.

Just inches away from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nDavid steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off.\r\nDavid gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt.\r\n\r\nBlood pumps from the gash.\r\n\r\nLucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David a\r\nsecond time. With malice.\r\n\r\nAnd again. Plunges the blade into his chest.
