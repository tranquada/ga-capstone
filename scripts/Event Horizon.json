Again and again and again...\n\n               This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears \n               it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a \n               single blow. Miller GROANS.\n\n<b>                                     WEIR\n</b>                         I'm not the Devil.

Miller slides through the coolant, \n               comes to rest beneath a walkway.
