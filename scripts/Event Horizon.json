NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE\n\n               A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins \n               into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.\n\n               EXT.

NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER\n\n               to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No \n               longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: \n               a vast labyrinth of steel.\n\n               Its shadow swallows all in darkness.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY\n\n               Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, \n               illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: \n               shards of metal and glass.\n\n               MOVE from the Corridor into:\n\n               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE\n\n               A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, \n               reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz \n               windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark \n               but for one blinking red light.\n\n               An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.\n\n               The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the \n               helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in \n               the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and \n               his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR.

Sweat beads his \n               ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.\n\n               He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. \n               Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count \n               photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful \n               woman.\n\n               Weir reaches to the stand.

Looks at the photo. Presses it to \n               his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, \n               just one more time.\n\n                                     WEIR\n                              (whisper)\n                         I miss you.\n\n               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER\n\n               Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a \n               straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind \n               him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...\n\n               Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the \n               mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... \n               DRIP.\n\n               Weir turns back to his shaving.\n\n               INT.

STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER\n\n               Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal \n               mechanically, forcing himself to swallow.

DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION\n\n               Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a \n               delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. \n               The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.\n\n               TITLE CARD: DAYLIGHT SPACE STATION 08.23.2046\n\n               INT.

Lyle?\n\n               INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n\n               Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A \n               box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing \n               red dot in its orbit.\n\n               INT.
