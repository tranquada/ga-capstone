Hi, Hartley.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tHi, Dolores.\n\n\tDOLORES watches as WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO affectionately say\n\tgoodbye to their boy.

The conversation continues from the\n\tprevious voice over.\n\n\tIn the corner of the room sits ABBOTT, DOLORES'S husband.\n\tABBOTT has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be\n\tcompletely paralyzed.  His presence, however, is intense and\n\tpowerful.\n\n\tMITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his\n\tconversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him\n\tlike a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOLORES\n\t\tDolores.

The Ottos\n\t\tare what I'd call model citizens.\n\t\tThey're regular at town meetings.\n\t\tThey give their opinions  in a\n\t\trespectful way.  They always help\n\t\tout at various fund-raising bazaars\n\t\tin town , though they aren't church\n\t\tgoers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tAnd they loved Bear.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOLORES\n\t\tOh yes.  Like I said, they always\n\t\tcame out together to see him off to\n\t\tschool.  It's like he was their\n\t\tlittle treasure.  He was such a\n\t\tbeautiful boy.  That's a picture of\n\t\thim on the wall there, behind\n\t\tAbbott.\n\n\tMITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR.\n\n\tIt is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide\n\this attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching\n\ta prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ABBOTT'S\n\tglaring eyes.\n\n\tANGLE ON\n\n\tThe PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.

He\n\twaves back at his children.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOLORES\n\t\t\t\t(voice over)\n\t\tBilly Ansel started honking at us up\n\t\taround Upper Hat Creek.  He always\n\t\tstarted to do that when he caught up\n\t\tto the bus.  He'd wave at his kids,\n\t\tJessica and Mason, who always sat at\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tthe back.

He took over raising the\n\t\tchildren by himself.  It was obvious\n\t\thow much he missed Lydia.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tYou talked about it?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOLORES\n\t\tNo.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI saw it on his face.\n\n\tPause.

A few feet from the stove,\n\tsitting on an overstuffed cushion, is HARTLEY OTTO.\n\n\tHARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones.  He is very\n\tstoned.  WANDA moves over, and pulls the headphones off her\n\thusband's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tWe have a guest.

He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold\n\tthem under his chin.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL (CONT'D)\n\t\tThe Walkers spoke very highly of\n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tYou've been retained?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tTheir child died, and they got a\n\t\tlawyer.\n\n\tPause.

Besides, the school\n\t\tboard's insurance on Dolores is\n\t\tminimal.  A few million at the very\n\t\tmost.  The really deep pockets are\n\t\tto be found in the town, or in the\n\t\tcompany that made the bus.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tYou think someone else caused the\n\t\taccident?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tMrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing\n\t\tas an accident.  The word doesn't\n\t\tmean anything to me.  As far as I'm\n\t\tconcerned, somebody somewhere made a\n\t\tdecision to cut a corner.  Some\n\t\tcorrupt agency or corporation\n\t\taccounted the cost variance between\n\t\ta ten-cent bolt and a million dollar\n\t\tout-of-court settlement.  They\n\t\tdecided to sacrifice a few lives for\n\t\tthe difference.  That's what's done,\n\t\tMrs. Otto.

How many times\n\t\thas she steered clear of danger?\n\t\tWhat went wrong that morning?\n\n\tMITCHELL takes the cup of tea.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL (CONT'D)\n\t\tSomeone calculated ahead of time\n\t\twhat it would cost to sacrifice\n\t\tsafety.  It's the darkest, most\n\t\tcynical thing to imagine, but it's\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tabsolutely true.  And now, it's up\n\t\tto me to make them build that bus\n\t\twith an extra bolt, or add an extra\n\t\tyard of guard rail.  It's the only\n\t\tway we can ensure moral\n\t\tresponsibility in this society.  By\n\t\twhat I do.\n\n\tPause.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tSo you're just the thing we need.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tExcuse me?\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tIsn't that what you want us to\n\t\tbelieve?  That we're completely\n\t\tdefenseless?  That you know what's\n\t\tbest?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tListen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very\n\t\tcarefully.  I do know what's best.\n\n\t\tAs we're sitting here the town or\n\t\tthe school board or the manufacturer\n\t\tof that bus are lining up a battery\n\t\tof their own lawyers to negotiate\n\t\twith people as grief-stricken as\n\t\tyourselves.  And this makes me very,\n\t\tvery mad.  It's why I came all the\n\t\tway up here.  If everyone had done\n\t\ttheir job with integrity your son\n\t\twould be alive this morning and\n\t\tsafely in school.  I promise you\n\t\tthat I will pursue and reveal who it\n\t\twas that did not do their job.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\tWho is responsible for this tragedy.\n\t\tThen, in your name and the Walkers'\n\t\tname and the name of whoever decides\n\t\tto join us, I shall sue.  I shall\n\t\tsue for negligence until they bleed.\n\n\tPause.\n\n\t\t\t\tWANDA\n\t\tI want that person to go to jail.\n\t\tFor the rest of his life.  I want\n\t\thim to die there.
