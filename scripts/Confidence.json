A pillar of\nsteam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark\nplace between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.\nWe see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable\nsuit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the\nsurroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run\nfor Congress some day.  At first glance.\nJake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution\nstyle. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling\nin a strawberry field.\n                       JAKE (V.O.)\n           And I think it's because of this\n           redhead...\n                       BUTCH (O.S.)\n           Know who I am, Jake?\n                       JAKE\n           The Anti-Christ?\n                       BUTCH (O.S.)\n           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ.

The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's\near and comes to rest at the base of his skull.\nThe voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his\nsuit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a\n\"Steve\" or \"Roger\" more than a \"Butch\".\n                       BUTCH (cont' d)\n           Things are probably going to end badly\n           for you, Jake.\n                       JAKE\n           Gee...
