WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL\n\nAll we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,\nrolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and\ncrusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work\nclothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the\nvery top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.\n\nA long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn\nelsewhere and he looks down.\n\nREVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV\n\nFar below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss\nthe yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed\nprison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an\nambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the\nbase of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the\nofficials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look\nup at McMurphy.\n\nMcMURPHY\n\nAs he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (V.O.)\n\t\t(through bullhorn)\n\tMcMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,\n\tfrom the infirmary. Can you hear\n\tme?\n\nMcMurphy doesn't respond.\n\n\t\t\tSHANKLE (V.O.)\n\t\t(through bullhorn)\n\tCan you hear me, McMurphy?\n\nMcMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a\nSECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND VOICE\n\t\t(through bullhorn)\n\tWhy don't we blast 'im, for Christ\n\tsake, he ain't gonna come down...\n\tyou...\n\nThe BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy\ncontinues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against\nthe coming night when...\n\n\t\t\tSHANKLE (V.O.)\n\t\t(through bullhorn)\n\tMcMurphy!\n\tI have the warden's promise. If you\n\tcome down, nobody will hurt you!\n\tYou'll be in my custody! I promise!\n\nAn imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.\n\nINT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN\n\nStrange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS\nas we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls.\nThe third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that\nopens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side\nof the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into\nrooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion\nroom, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.\n\nAcross the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where\nTURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off\nduty.\n\nThe CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns,\nanother twists, a third lies as if dead.\n\nCAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open,\nvery alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from\nunder the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.\n\nA beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which\nbinds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes\nhis way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other\npatients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.\n\nAhead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three\nNegro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed\nin white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and\ndisappear into a side room.\n\nBromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as\nTurkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes\nup the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in,\npassing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses'\nstation and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.\n\nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY\n\nas Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the\nnurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy\npreparing the day's medication.\n\nBromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is\nsuddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his\nneck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden\nfreezes. Terrified.\n\n\t\t\tMILLER\n\tWhere you goin', Chief?\n\n\t\t\tWARREN\n\tYou goin' t'see the Big White\n\tFathuh?\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON\n\tHe goin' t'see the Big White\n\tMuthuh...\n\nThey cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's\neyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but\nWashington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic\nspreading across his face.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON (CONT'D)\n\tHaw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat\n\tapples off my head an' he mine me\n\tlike a baby...\n\nA KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington\nvery adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns,\nalong with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE\nenters the ward.\n\n\t\t\tTHREE ATTENDANTS\n\t\t(simultaneously, as Big\n\t\tNurse passes)\n\tMornin', Miss Ratched...\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE\n\tGood morning, boys.\n\nShe sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The\nthree attendants put their mops and rags aside and start\ntowards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the\nwall, mop in hand.\n\nINT. NURSES' STATION\n\nas Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears\nan enormous cross between her breasts.\n\n\t\t\tMISS PILBOW\n\tGood morning, Miss Ratched. It's a\n\tbeautiful day, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE\n\tMean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean\n\told Monday...\n\t\t(she flips on the\n\t\tintercom)\n\tGood morning, boys. Rise and shine.\n\tRise and shine.\n\nINT. MEN'S DORM - DAY\n\nas Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of\nbed.\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE (V.O.)\n\t\t(through loudspeaker)\n\tTime to get up! Come on now, it's a\n\tbeautiful day! Let's not straggle!\n\tEverybody up, up, up!\n\nThe Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes,\nwho can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room,\nrubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of\nthe Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the\npatients toward the washroom.\n\nMiller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up\nhis mattress.\n\nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY\n\nas the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE\n\tGood morning, Mister Sefelt... Good\n\tmorning, Mister Fredrickson. Good\n\tmorning, Billy, I spoke to your\n\tmother last night and she sends her\n\tlove... Good morning, Mister\n\tHarding... Good morning, Mister\n\tCheswick. Mister Scanlon...\n\nBromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.\nBig Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE (CONT'D)\n\tOh, Mister Bromden...\n\t\t(calling out)\n\tMister Washington!\n\nWashington comes running.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON\n\tYes, Miss Ratched?\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE\n\tMister Washington, why don't we get\n\ta good head start on the day by\n\tshaving Mister Bromden and see if\n\twe can't avoid a disturbance.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON\n\t\t(taking Bromden by the\n\t\thand)\n\tYes, Miss Ratched...\n\nINT. WASHROOM - DAY\n\nThe patients are busy washing and shaving.\n\nWarren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington\nguides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an\nantique barber chair stands.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON\n\t\t(calling as he goes)\n\tWarren!\n\nHe sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then\nplugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the\nBUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns\naway.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON (CONT'D)\n\t\t(shouting out)\n\tGet your black ass in here!\n\nWarren props the vegetable up against the sink.\n\n\t\t\tWARREN\n\tTha's it... be right back!\n\nWarren leaves; the old man starts sliding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUICK CUT TO:\n\nBROMDEN\n\nas Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and\nWashington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO\nEXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the\nBUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is\nINSUPPORTABLE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUICK CUT TO:\n\nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY\n\nNo sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file\npast the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow\nhands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by,\nchecking to see each man takes his pills before filling their\ncups with orange juice.\nThe last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in\nthe Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.\n\nSatisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45\nrecord player with a stack of records, then she settles down\nto her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is\nHEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day\nRoom.\n\nThe patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down\nfor the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK\nand BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle\ntogether in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself,\nrubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits\npondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and\nforth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a\ngrimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his\nhead, mumbling over and over, \"Tired, awful tired...\" ELLIS\nstands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to\nthe wall by imaginary nails.\n\nBromden is pushing a mop around. \n\nWashington, Warren and Miller are in the men's dorm making up\nthe Chronics' beds when O.S. the TELEPHONE RINGS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. NURSES' STATION - DAY\n\nas Miss Pilbow picks up the phone.\n\n\t\t\tMISS PILBOW\n\tEighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking...\n\tYes...\n\t\t(she makes a note and\n\t\thangs it)\n\t... New admission, Miss Ratched...\n\nMiss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then\nturns and flips the intercom on.\n\n\t\t\tMISS PILBOW (CONT'D)\n\t\t(over loudspeaker)\n\tMister Washington! Mister Warren!\n\nShe exits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. DAY ROOM\n\nas Miss Pilbow exits nurses' station and heads down the\nhallway, Washington and Warren on her heels.

MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nStaff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main\nentrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY\nSHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND\nDEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to\nFirst Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the\nrear door to the car.\n\n\t\t\tDEPUTY SHERIFF\n\t\t(to an unseen occupant)\n\tOkay, let's go.\n\nA long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's\nwearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work\nshirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black\nboots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his\ncheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks\nout of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a\nsmall gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.\n\n\t\t\tDEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)\n\tLet's move it...\n\nMcMurphy goes up the stairs, followed by the Deputy, and\ncrosses into the building.\n\nINT.

First Deputy hands McMurphy's gym bag to Washington,\nwho hands it to Warren.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND DEPUTY\n\tOkay, this is it!\n\nMcMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed,\nMcMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and\nplants a kiss on his forehead.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)\n\t\t(squirming out of\n\t\tMcMurphy's grasp)\n\tJesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tYeah, ain't that the truth.\n\n\t\t\tDEPUTY SHERIFF\n\t\t(to Miss Pilbow)\n\tHe's all yours, Miss.\n\n\t\t\tMISS PILBOW\n\tThank you, Officer...\n\nThe two Deputies start down the stairs.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tSo long, fellas...\n\nThe two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who\ntakes a deep breath of fresh air.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY (CONT'D)\n\tYes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall\n\tday...\n\n\t\t\tMISS PILBOW\n\tThis way, Mister McMurphy.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tYes, ma'am...\n\nMcMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door\ncloses behind them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.

So\n\twhy don't you boys just shove off.\n\tI got some planning to do.\n\nMcMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and\nScanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again.\n\nBromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants\nlistening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but\ndoesn't know how.\n\n\t\t\tSEFELT\n\tMaybe he'll just show Miss Ratched\n\this big thing an' she'll open the\n\tdoor for him.\n\nSefelt and Frederickson smile at each other.\n\nBromden slides along the wall toward the door.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tMaybe I'll just use that thick\n\tskull of yours as a batterin' ram,\n\tSefelt.\n\n\t\t\tSEFELT (CONT'D)\n\tWhy, my head would just squash like\n\tan eggplant, McMurphy.\n\nFredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tYou think it's funny, huh?\n\n\t\t\tTABER\n\tYeah, you don't know how to get\n\toutta this place!\n\nBromden reaches the door and looks out.

Okay, stand aside, you\n\tguys! You're usin' up my oxygen!\n\nThe Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine.\n\nHe shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on\nhis thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each\nside, and strains.\n\nBromden watches, in awe of McMurphy.\n\nMcMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for\na better position.\n\n\t\t\tHARDING\n\tGiving up?\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tJust warmin' up.\n\nHe grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the\nstrain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his\nbreath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall.\nThere's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath.\nHe opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a\npocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands\nare frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the\nfloor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tBut I tried. Goddammit, I sure as\n\thell did that much. Didn't I?\n\nMcMurphy exits.\n\nREACTION SHOT OF ACUTES\n\nSHOT OF BROMDEN\n\nlooking at the machine. A long beat.\n\nINT.

The men go\nsprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,\nhandshakes and back-slapping going on when --\n\n\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t(over bull horn)\n\tAll right! Stand to!

Here's\n\tthe goddamn cigarettes!\n\nMcMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass\nof struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm\nand tries to wheel him away.\n\nMcMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in\nWashington's face.\n\nWashington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him\nagainst the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as\nMcMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and\nstarts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out,\nchipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his\nfist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing\nhim against the wall.\n\nMcMurphy moves in for the kill.\n\n\t\t\tWASHINGTON\n\tWarren!

HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nas McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed\nto a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a\ndouble set of heavy security doors.\n\nThe first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the\nthree aides crammed in the small space between the two doors\nwhile another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and\nBromden step through, followed by the aides.\n\nINT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nAs the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead\nBromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle\nthem.\n\n\t\t\tAIDE\n\t\t(pointing to a bench)\n\tWait over there...\n\nThe three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and\nBromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is\na man sitting next to them.\n\nMcMURPHY'S POV\n\nThe architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but\nit is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades\nall. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other.\nOthers stand shifting from one foot to the other, while\nothers walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers\nnot unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much\nsedation).\n\nSuddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily,\nshouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and\nenters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat,\nthen the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him\nback to his seat, talking softly to the man.\n\nFurther down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east\nroom with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled\nfurther down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to\nsleep it off.\n\nTwo aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's\ndirection, where one of the aides motions to the patient\nsitting next to McMurpby.\n\n\t\t\tAIDE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(approaching him very\n\t\tgently)\n\tCome on, Joey... this isn't going\n\tto hurt you... good for you... make\n\tyou feel better...\n\nThe patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.\n\nThe aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall\nto the EST room.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nAs McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of\ngum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one.\nMcMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.\n\n\t\t\tBROMDEN\n\tThank you.\n\nMcMurphy looks up. A long beat.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tSay it again.\n\n\t\t\tBROMDEN\n\tThank you.\n\nAnother beat.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tSay...

Remember, this is just\n\tbetween you an' me. Do ya\n\tunderstand?\n\nBromden nods.\n\n\t\t\tNURSE ITSU (O.S.)\n\tMister McMurphy.\n\nMcMurphy turns to see Nurse Itsu. The two aides are standing\nbehind her.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\t\t(recognizing a long-lost\n\t\tfriend)\n\tHey, how ya doin'?\n\n\t\t\tNURSE ITSU\n\tFine, thank you.\n\t\t(offering pills)\n\tHere, please take these.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tWhat are they?\n\n\t\t\tNURSE ITSU\n\tTo help you relax... please...\n\nMcMurphy takes the pills and downs them.

Well, see ya around, Itsu.\n\nItsu smiles at McMurphy.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tYeah...\n\nMcMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in.\n\nBromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.\n\nINT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThere are four other aides in there, standing around an empty\ngurney.\n\nA DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\t\t(as he enters)\n\tHi...\n\nMcMurphy looks around at the six aides.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tYou boys can take a cigarette break\n\tnow...\n\nThe Nurse smiles at him.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\tThat's all right, Mister McMurphy,\n\tjust climb on the bed and lie\n\tdown...\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tWhatever you say, Doc...\n\nMcMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down.\n\nThe Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes\nMcMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar\nof salve.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\t(to McMurphy)\n\tThis won't hurt you at all...\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tUh, uh...\n\nThe Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\tWhat's that for?\n\n\t\t\tNURSE\n\tConductant.\n\n\t\t\tMCMURPHY\n\t\t(smiling up at her)\n\tSurely, goodness and mercy will\n\tfollow this, eh, honey?\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\t(holding a mouthpiece)\n\tPlease, put this in your mouth...\n\nMcMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to\nthe head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's\ntemples.\n\nThe Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently\nplace their hands, in a very professional manner, on\nMcMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor\nturns to his controls.\n\nSHOT OF McMURPHY\n\nas he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified\nby the whole process, when suddenly, without warning,\nMcMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of\nsurprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A\nmoment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body\nrelaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms\nbegin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very\nclear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the\ngurney, until the last spasm subsides.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSLOW FADE OUT\n\t\t\t\t\tTO:\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT.

They cross to the security gate, open it and pass\ninto the hallway.\n\nWashington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy\nand Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room.\n\nThe Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his\nhand.\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE (CONT'D)\n\tYes, Mister Fredrickson?\n\n\t\t\tFREDRICKSON\n\tI wanna know why the dorm has to be\n\tlocked in the daytime and on\n\tweekends?\n\n\t\t\tTABER\n\tYeah, why can't a fellow even have\n\tthe weekends to himself?\n\n\t\t\tCHESWICK\n\t\t(standing up)\n\tYeah, whadabout our cigarettes?\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE\n\tSit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait\n\tyour turn!\n\nHe sits.\n\n\t\t\tBIG NURSE (CONT'D)\n\tIf the dorms were left open, you\n\twould just return to bed after\n\tbreakfast...\n\n\t\t\tFREDRICKSON\n\tSo what?

First woman takes me on is\n\tgonna light up like a pinball\n\tmachine an' pay off in silver\n\tdollars...\n\nMcMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the\nChronics.

MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK\n\nas Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat,\nthen he turns into the room and looks around.\n\nBROMDEN'S POV\n\nThe patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast\nasleep in the nurses' station.\n\nBromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed,\nwhere he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A\nlong beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.\n\n\t\t\tBROMDEN\n\t\t(whispering in McMurphy's\n\t\tear)\n\tWhen I first came here I was so\n\tscared of being lost I had to\n\tholler so they could track me... I\n\tfigured anything was better than\n\tbeing lost...\n\nOn the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's\nface and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing\nand Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then\nthe thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his\npillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.\n\nINT.

TUB ROOM - DAWN\n\nas Bromden crosses to the heavy machine which McMurphy had\nonce tried to lift, sizes it up, then bends over and takes\nhold and heaves. The GRINDING WEIGHT is HEARD as Bromden\nexerts all his strength, slowly lifts the machine off the\nfloor, balances it above his shoulders, then crosses out of\nthe tub room.\n\nINT. DAY ROOM - DAWN\n\nas Bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping\nnight attendant in the nurses' station.\n\nBromden lines himself up with the window across the room,\nthen starts toward it, picking up speed as he goes. Then, at\nthe last moment, he stops and, with an enormous effort, he\nhurls the machine through the security screen and the window.\nA LOUD CRASH.\n\nIn the nurses' station, the night attendant starts awake and\nlooks around. Too late as Bromden vaults through the window.\nCAMERA HOLDS on window as Bromden runs across the grounds and\ndisappears into the pine trees.\n\nINT. DAY ROOM - DAWN\n\nas the night attendant comes out of the nurses' station and\nlooks confusedly around. Then he spots the shattered window.\n\nEXT.
