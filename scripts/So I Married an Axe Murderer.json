The streets become even \n               more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts \n               out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. \n               RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. \n               Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. \n               Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:\n\n<b>               HIS STREET\n</b>\n               He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an \n               apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his \n               window.

He looks like \n               a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking \n               and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan \n               pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his \n               cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment \n               utters:\n\n<b>                                     THRESHOLD KEEPER\n</b>                         Boo.\n\n<b>               INT.

There are exhibits of Abraham \n               Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. As they look more \n               closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as \n               Bill's. They laugh.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The bagpipes let out an \n               ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a \n               tortured animal.

Rose then appears on the roof holding the \n               Axe, still.\n\n<b>                                     ROSE\n</b>                              (mostly to herself; \n                              slurring most words)\n                         Charlie, did you like your note? I \n                         thought it was pretty accurate. I \n                         did all the husbands' notes. I can \n                         forge anyone's handwriting, I can \n                         write in anyone's style. See, I'm an \n                         artist. Harriet isn't an artist. \n                         Sure she could get a husband, but \n                         she could never have done this. And \n                         you know what I'm most proud of?\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         What's that, Rose?\n\n<b>                                     ROSE\n</b>                         Harriet never knew.

Rose.\n\n<b>               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW\n</b>\n               There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the \n               window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in \n               amazement.\n\n<b>               REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\n               Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in \n               full Norse Regalia.\n\n<b>               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW\n</b>\n               Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.\n\n<b>               INT. THE ROOF\n</b>\n               Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the \n               swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery \n               icy roof she falls and starts to slide.\n\n               Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, \n               Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about \n               to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are \n               slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.\n\n               Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for \n               life.\n\n               He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her \n               hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.\n\n               She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder \n               and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets \n               down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the \n               side of the drainpipe to get her.\n\n               Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his \n               help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.\n\n               Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in \n               bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself \n               hanging on for dear life.\n\n               He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as \n               he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. \n               Charlie, then with all his strength -- his \"where has this \n               strength been my whole life\" strength -- pulls her up to the \n               roof next to him.\n\n               Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over \n               to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her, \n               handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof \n               appears Tony.\n\n<b>                                     TONY\n</b>                         I hate to bother you on your \n                         honeymoon, Charlie, but...\n\n               Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the \n               doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         Thank God.
