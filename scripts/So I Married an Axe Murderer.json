Kerouac's \n               poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We \n               come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to \"THE \n               CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE\" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY \n               where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign \n               depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous \"I'm looking into the \n               distance, having a brilliant thought\" pose...\n\n               CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel \n               shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front \n               of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the \n               exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a \n               bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the \n               alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into...\n\n               INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE\n\n               We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant \n               Manager, by night he is a poet.\n\n               A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, \n               Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive \n               Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit.\n\n               Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes \n               writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (sotto)\n                         O' SCOTLAND\n                         YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME\n\n               CUSTOMER approaches.\n\n                                     CUSTOMER\n                         Do you have the book On The Road by \n                         Jack Kerouac?\n\n               Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in \n               to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and \n               without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display \n               of thousands of copies of On The Road.

SAN FRANCISCO STREETS\n\n               The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the \n               BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become \n               less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own \n               FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even \n               more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts \n               out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. \n               RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. \n               Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. \n               Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:\n\n               HIS STREET\n\n               He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an \n               apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his \n               window. A CRASHING sound from within.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               HANDS\n\n               taking papers out of a desk drawer.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CHARLIE\n\n               carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing \n               it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. \n               Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.\n\n                                                               CUT BACK TO:\n\n               SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME\n\n               with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde.\n\n                                                               CUT BACK TO:\n\n               CHARLIE\n\n               finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of \n               his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE HANDS\n\n               clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them \n               into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CHARLIE\n\n               pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver, \n               then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in \n               the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop \n               making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes, \n               terrified.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE BEDROOM\n\n               where the HANDS, freeze.\n\n                                                               CUT BACK TO:\n\n               CHARLIE\n\n               Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats... \n               then springs Samurai style into...\n\n               THE BEDROOM\n\n               He freezes.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL\n\n               that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken \n               picture. It's Charlie's girlfriend, SHERRI.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Sherri!

I don't mean to meddle, \n                         but isn't it better to rob other \n                         peoples' homes? Start accumulating \n                         their wealth as opposed to just \n                         reaccumulating your own wealth.\n\n                                     SHERRI\n                         That's not funny, Charlie.

When we first started going \n                         out I thought we agreed that we \n                         weren't the sort of people who got \n                         married.\n\n                                     SHERRI\n                         That's like saying we're not the \n                         sort of people who are going to grow \n                         old.

It's called \"I dunno\".\n\n               Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. \n               It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for \n               Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         We should get going, Charlie.

POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT\n\n               ALLEN GINSBERG is on stage. He is brilliant. Tony, Charlie, \n               and Harriet are all amused. Susan is bored stiff. Charlie is \n               looking at Tony. Tony glances over at Susan and gives Charlie \n               an \"Oh, well.\" look. Then he looks at Harriet and nods in \n               approval of her.\n\n               EXT. FISHERMAN'S WHARF - NIGHT\n\n               The four of them walk along the wharf. Charlie is at one of \n               those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets \n               and try and knock them down. Charlie knocks two down.\n\n                                     ARCADE MAN\n                         One more and you get your pick.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (to Harriet)\n                         You do it.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         No, Charlie.

Harriet winds up and \n               throws the bean bag directly into his neck.\n\n                                     ARCADE MAN\n                         Hey!\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Sorry... I told you Charlie.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         No, no, you're okay, you're just \n                         having control problems.\n\n               They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her.

The \"KEEPER OF THE \n               THRESHOLD\" so described in a poorly written sign, is an \n               overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a \n               denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like \n               a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking \n               and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan \n               pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his \n               cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment \n               utters:\n\n                                     THRESHOLD KEEPER\n                         Boo.\n\n               INT.

As they look more \n               closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as \n               Bill's. They laugh.\n\n               EXT.

He \n               knows he's blown it.\n\n               INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied \n               work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very \n               loudly.\n\n               Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors \n               off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes \n               it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, \n               who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes.\n\n                                     STEWARDESS\n                         I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a \n                         stewardess, and I have an early flight \n                         out in the morning. Can you please \n                         keep your music down?\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I thought it was coming from here.\n\n                                     STEWARDESS\n                         But someone keeps shouting your name \n                         over and over.\n\n               Puzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony.\n\n               EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT\n\n               Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the \n               noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, \n               accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER \n               AND A GUY ON A SNARE.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED \n                         HARBINGER OF HAGGIS \n                         BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER\n                         UNTRUST-ING\n                         UNKNOW-ING\n                         UNLOV-ING\n                         HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO \n                         THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING \n                         TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT \n                         THE PASSION OF HIS HEART \n                         I AM LONELY,\n                         IT'S REALLY HARD\n                         THIS POEM SUCKS\n\n               A crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on \n               their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly \n               takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a \n               flower. He's won her back.\n\n               INT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Romantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie \n               are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water \n               extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping \n               him pretty busy.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I've been there for almost a year. I \n                         only planned on stay with her for a \n                         few weeks, but she gets upset every \n                         time I say I'm moving.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         You were close as kids?\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I pretty much raised her. You know \n                         the scene. Depressed mother... \n                         withdrawn father.\n                              (she remembers)\n                         My dad was a photographer too.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Really?\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         He hated it. Trudging off to those \n                         weddings every Saturday night. Other \n                         people's celebrations he called it. \n                         He said sometimes they didn't even \n                         offer him a glass of soda. He had a \n                         small studio, and every year at \n                         Christmas he'd take a picture of me \n                         and Rose and put it in the window on \n                         a little card that said \"Seasons \n                         Greetings.\" Awful pictures. It's \n                         like... I could see his pain in my \n                         face. Anyway, me and my sister worked \n                         with our \"childhood issues\" in \n                         different ways. She became a \n                         photographer and I became phobic \n                         about having my picture taken. It's \n                         quite a family.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Where are they now? Your parents?\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Dead.

Charlie approaches Harriet.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Harriet, I wanna talk to you.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Boy, you really made some impression \n                         with Ralph. She can't get over you.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (stalling; nervous)\n                         I'm just so happy for you to have \n                         friends like Ralph. What a great \n                         friend to have.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Is everything all right, Charlie? \n                         You're perspiring.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Harriet... marry me.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         What?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I want to have a wedding.

It's so good \n                         like it is. Why don't we just live \n                         together first?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Because, I love you and I want you \n                         to marry me and be with me for 45 \n                         years. I want you to have my children, \n                         and I want to have your children. I \n                         know that sounds like a lot of \n                         children, and they might not all get \n                         along, but... I'm finally ready to \n                         trust you and to make a commitment. \n                         Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my \n                         wife.\n\n               Harriet flinches slightly at the word \"Wife\", but Charlie is \n               too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the \n               group.\n\n                                     STUART\n                         I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing \n                         us this party. I hope some day you \n                         have the same great 45 years that \n                         we've had.\n\n               People clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears \n               in his eyes.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Yes.\n\n               At first it doesn't register.

Just two \n                         little things...\n                              (as Tony looks in)\n                         That woman over there in the corner... \n                         She's Harriet's friend, and her name \n                         is Ralph.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         No shit.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         And secondly...

And the last \n                         thing in the world she'd be is a \n                         murderer.\n\n               And then Harriet begins singing at the piano.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (singing)\n                         ONLY YOU...\n                         CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT...\n                         ONLY YOU...\n                         CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT...\"\n\n               Tony and Charlie look at each other. \"Only you?\" Then Charlie \n               looks at his bride with confidence.\n\n               He walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment.\n\n               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\n               Charlie and Harriet pick out a diamond ring.\n\n               INT. TRAVEL AGENCY\n\n               Charlie and Harriet point to brochures of the different cities \n               they could go to on their honeymoon. They decide on a picture \n               of the \"DRY CREEK LODGE\" in Oregon.\n\n               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE\n\n               They are getting their blood tests back. Harriet looks at \n               hers, casually. Charlie is nervous. Reluctantly he opens the \n               file and looks at it. He is pleased with the results and \n               does a victory dance.\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - ESTABLISHING\n\n               INT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH\n\n               Charlie and Harriet are being married. Harriet is in a \n               beautiful wedding gown. Charlie is wearing a kilt. Tony is \n               the best man. He also wears a kilt. Stuart, also kilted, \n               May, the whole family along with a hundred well-wishers are \n               in attendance. The SCOTTISH MINISTER presides. Rose is in a \n               kilt.\n\n                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER\n                         Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take \n                         this woman to be your wife, through \n                         thick and thin, for better or for \n                         worse, please say: \"I do\"...\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I do...\n\n                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER\n                         Now Harriet, if you will take this \n                         man, through good times and bad, for \n                         ever and ever, as your husband, please \n                         say \"I Do\"...\n\n               Harriet starts to speak; but right before the words come \n               out, she stares into Charlie's eyes and STOPS. Charlie looks \n               nervous. So does the Scottish Minister. So does Tony. So \n               does everyone.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (after a long pause; \n                              finally:)\n                         I do.\n\n                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER\n                         Now Charlie... Kiss the beautiful \n                         bride!\n\n               Charlie and Harriet kiss. We can see (though Charlie can't) \n               Harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face. Tony \n               notices it though and can't figure it out.\n\n                                     STUART\n                         Let's get pissed.\n\n               The wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken Scotsman \n               on BAGPIPES.\n\n               INT. RECEPTION HALL\n\n               A Scottish accordionist and a Drummer play SCOTLAND THE BRAVE. \n               Some OLDER SCOTTISH AUNTIES are CLAPPING and HOOTING LOUDLY \n               along with the tune. Some young girl COUSINS in traditional \n               Scottish costume, dance the sword dance along to SCOTLAND \n               THE BRAVE.\n\n               We pass the buffet which we see is catered by \"Meats Of The \n               World.\" Then we pass a very drunken Stuart in a heated \n               discussion with four other people.\n\n                                     STUART\n                         You know Golden Gate park was designed \n                         by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is \n                         who MacClaren park was named after.\n\n               The others agree heartily.\n\n               May and Tony are dancing. May is dancing uncomfortably close. \n               She keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then \n               has to move back to his shoulder.\n\n               Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's \n               table. All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to \n               feel his head.\n\n               We find Charlie in a corner. One of the hooting Scottish \n               aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch.\n\n                                     AUNTIE MOLLY\n                              (proffering the Scotch)\n                         Charlie, get this down your neck.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Auntie Molly if I have another one \n                         I'll end up underneath the table \n                         with my kilt over my head.\n\n               Tony joins them.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Where's Harriet?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I don't know. Oh, there she is.\n\n               She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous. \n               She has enough food in front or her for three people.\n\n               She eats ravenously and incessantly. Charlie goes over to \n               her.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         A little hungry, were you?\n\n               At that moment, a FLASH goes off. Harriet looks up angrily.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         What are you...!\n\n               Then she realizes it's Rose. She calms down and smiles. \n               Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains \n               her composure.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Sorry. The flash just...\n\n               The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the \n               bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his \n               ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and \n               then breaks into Rod Stewart's \"IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY.\" From \n               across the room we hear Stuart singing.\n\n                                     STUART\n                              (full volume; singing)\n                         IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY...\n                         AND YOU WANT MY BODY...\n                         COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.\n\n               Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in \n               the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests \n               start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man \n               continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to \n               play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face \n               first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an \n               ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a \n               tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene.\n\n               EXT.

A small band \n               plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. \n               The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up \n               their glass.\n\n                                     BAND LEADER\n                         ...we're honored to be here for this \n                         very special day in...\n\n               The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a \n               TELEPHONE.

It's a tradition.\n\n               Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing \n               slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music \n               plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He \n               tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an \n               escape.\n\n               Then suddenly, call it luckily, MR.

Sure...\n\n               Charlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. \n               Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when \n               suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The \n               LIGHTS ARE OUT.\n\n               In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered \n               moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting \n               for an exit to the outside.\n\n               He arrives in someone's arms on his way.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I need your help!

She smiles a very disturbed \n               grin. He doesn't know what to say.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (much too pleasant)\n                         Hello, Charlie.\n\n               Charlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly \n               both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see \n               the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing \n               them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along \n               loudly.\n\n               Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. \n               Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and \n               down the hallway.\n\n                                     WAITER\n                         Let's take 'em to their room.\n\n                                     CONCIERGE\n                         Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of \n                         these crowds for one night.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         My dinner.

CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM\n\n               Charlie & Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down \n               the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare \n               at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around \n               the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The \n               fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks \n               like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I heard you on the phone before, \n                         Charlie. There's something I've got \n                         to tell you.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (frightened)\n                         Harriet, I...\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I've been married before.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I already know.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         About my husbands?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Yes. And I was meaning to have a \n                         word with you. We could get an \n                         annulment.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (screams)\n                         AAAhhhhhhh!\n\n               Suddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark. \n               A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a \n               walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear \n               Harriet WAILING. Which continues.\n\n               Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky \n               escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and \n               standing there is Rose.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be \n                         so glad to see you.\n\n               Rose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker \n               back on.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (going to the phone)\n                         Maybe the phones are working again \n                         by now.\n\n               He listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note. \n               He starts to read is:\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle \n                         the commitment. I'm leaving you.' \n                         Signed, 'Charlie.'\n\n               And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         What the hell is this? I didn't write \n                         this?\n\n               And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG \n               THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         What the fuck?!\n\n               She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk \n               and the room is in complete DARKNESS.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? \n                         I warned you not to marry her, didn't \n                         I? I warned all of them. But none of \n                         them listened to me. They all went \n                         ahead and married her. She's the \n                         pretty one. Where's Harriet? What \n                         have you done with my sister, Harriet?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Nothing, Rose.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         If you've done something to my sister, \n                         Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill \n                         you.\n\n               We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from \n               what he can't see. He stays very silent.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (from the closet)\n                         Where are you, Charlie? What's going \n                         on?\n\n               Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes \n               toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie \n               is gone.\n\n               INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, \n               winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on \n               the dash.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Could you stop doing that please?\n\n               EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT\n\n               Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm \n               continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase \n               him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and \n               sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC \n               playing in the room\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Call the police!\n\n               INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME\n\n               The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their \n               window. Then Rose races by.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Call the police!\n\n               Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear.\n\n               EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT\n\n               Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at \n               several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the \n               Axe, still.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                              (mostly to herself; \n                              slurring most words)\n                         Charlie, did you like your note? I \n                         thought it was pretty accurate. I \n                         did all the husbands' notes. I can \n                         forge anyone's handwriting, I can \n                         write in anyone's style. See, I'm an \n                         artist. Harriet isn't an artist. \n                         Sure she could get a husband, but \n                         she could never have done this. And \n                         you know what I'm most proud of?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         What's that, Rose?\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Harriet never knew. She thought they \n                         all just left her. I protected her. \n                         She's my sister.\n\n               Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM\n\n               Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn.\n\n                                     TONY\n                              (shouting)\n                         Charlie!\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                              (from closet)\n                         Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. \n                         I'm in here.\n\n               Carefully, Tony opens the closet door.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. \n                         They're out on the ledge.\n\n                                     TONY\n                              (not believing)\n                         Get on the floor and put your hands \n                         behind your back.\n\n               Harriet willingly goes on the floor.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Sure, anything. You've got to save \n                         Charlie.\n\n               Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM\n\n               Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and \n               Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         Look! It's Charlie!\n\n               From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. \n               He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the \n               pursuing Rose, and rushes off.\n\n               Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Nice try.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I swear to you... It was Charlie... \n                         Look! Now there's Rose!\n\n               Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         No you don't.\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I beg you... Look! It is Rose.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Oh no, not again.\n                              (he glances at the \n                              window)\n                         Aaaaah! Rose.\n\n               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW\n\n               There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the \n               window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in \n               amazement.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in \n               full Norse Regalia.\n\n               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW\n\n               Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.\n\n               INT. THE ROOF\n\n               Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the \n               swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery \n               icy roof she falls and starts to slide.\n\n               Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, \n               Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about \n               to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are \n               slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.\n\n               Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for \n               life.\n\n               He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her \n               hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.\n\n               She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder \n               and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets \n               down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the \n               side of the drainpipe to get her.\n\n               Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his \n               help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.\n\n               Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in \n               bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself \n               hanging on for dear life.\n\n               He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as \n               he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. \n               Charlie, then with all his strength -- his \"where has this \n               strength been my whole life\" strength -- pulls her up to the \n               roof next to him.\n\n               Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over \n               to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her, \n               handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof \n               appears Tony.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         I hate to bother you on your \n                         honeymoon, Charlie, but...\n\n               Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the \n               doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, \n                         but I thought you were the killer, \n                         but you were acting pretty strange?\n\n                                     HARRIET\n                         I thought you were going to leave \n                         me, like the others. Thank God they \n                         were just murdered. I thought they \n                         were always leaving me.\n\n               Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off. The SIRENS \n               disappear. So do the crowds.\n\n                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:\n\n               THE SOUND OF A CROWD IN A CLUB:\n\n               INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE\n\n               Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik. He's reading his \n               poetry, but we can't hear it. He nods to someone off stage. \n               Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with \n               their three year old son, STUART, a miniature beatnik version \n               of Charlie.\n\n                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)\n                         My dad was right. You don't lose \n                         your muse once you're married. Nothing \n                         changed, except I gained a great \n                         son, Stuart.\n\n               SOUND UP on Charlie's poetry.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         MARRIED MAN\n                         MOST MERRY\n                         AND IN CONCLUSION\n\n                                     CROWD AND CHARLIE\n                         THIS POEM SUCKS.\n\n               The crowd goes crazy.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Thank you very much.\n\n               HOUSE MUSIC kicks on.
