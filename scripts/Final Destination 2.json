The Old\n<b>\n</b>Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve\nthem.\n\nThe signal turns from red to flashing yellow.\n\nKimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view\nmirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.\n\n\n<b>                       FRANKIE\n</b>              Dano, shouldn't we go back and help\n              your mother?\n\n<b>                            DANO\n</b>              Blo w me.\n\n<b>CU ON KIMBERLY\n</b>\nAs she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic\nroad sign that flashes \"WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET\".\n\n<b>NISSAN SUV\n</b>\nKimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow\nmini- bus carrying a high- school football team.\n\nKimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's\nspeeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back\nleft, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.\n\n<b>CLOSE.\n</b>\nKimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle\neach other, yelling:\n\n\n<b>                            FOOTBALL PLAYERS\n</b>                 Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up!\n\nKimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at\nearsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and\nreach to lower the volume.\n\nKimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY\nCAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.\n\n\n<b>                          DANO\n</b>                 Christ, is this tribute to Princess\n                 Di Day or what?\n\nKimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right.

Shaina spins around, her eyes\nwordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.\n\nThen Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.\n\n\n<b>                       MR.

What's up?\n\nDano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an\nunexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing\nat hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES\nHER TITS at Dano over:\n\n\n<b>                       MR.

The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A\nCOILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.\n\n\n<b>                        DANO\n</b>               Look first, idiot!\n\nShaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.\n\n\n<b>                        SHAINA\n</b>               Ignore 'em.\n\n<b>ON LOG TRUCK\n</b>\nOne end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the\npavement, sparking.\n\nLooking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls\nin behind her.\n\n\n<b>                        KIMBERLY\n</b>               Dano, put that out NOW.\n\nDano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window.

She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but\nhits it broadside --\n\nSending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the\nroad. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag\ndolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the\nside window.\n\nKimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side.

He swerves his\nTrans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.\n\nKimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF\nFIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still\nalive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to\nrelease the seatbelt.\n\nThen, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh\nthe wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it\nlike a top.

Evan\nappears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some\npackages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he\nclimbs.\n\nThe stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK\napparently left by some kids.\n\nAs Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing\nEvan to lean against -\n\nTHE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan\nslowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.\n\n\n<b>                      EVAN\n</b>             Motherfucker.\n<b>\n</b>A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward\nthe center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just\nmisses it!\n\nHe continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -\n\nThe Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and\nhe slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself\nand continues down the hallway.\n\n<b>INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nDim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small\npackages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.\n\nEvan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,\nwho cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing\nhis PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to\nthe fridge and grabs a drink.\n\nIn the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a\ngrease-filled frying pan.\n\nEvan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the\nsidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --\n\nAnd a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide\nforward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.\n\nEvan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the\nfrying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts\nthe frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.\n\nHe then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter\nnext to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out\n<b>HEY E.\n</b>\nPUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -\nthe word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the\nmicrowave and turns it on.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON STOVE\n</b>\nThe cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his\nanswering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his\npackages...\n\n\n<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>              Dude! You suck!

SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And\nugly sound.\n\nAs many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He\nslides it over his wrist, admiring it.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON KNIFE\n</b>\nLazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about\nan inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.\n\nBy now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond\nencrusted horseshoe ring.\n\nHe carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is\nFLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION\nfrom the microwave startles him.\n\nThe RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!\n\n\n<b>                         EVAN\n</b>              Damn it!\n\nEvan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When\nhe tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.\n\nAnother small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the\nGLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.\n\nFlames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil\nfrom the pan IGNITES. A small fire.\n\nEvan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE\nslowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He\ncontinues yanking... Stuck.\n\nHe sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His\nfingers reach for it.\n\nSlightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to\nknock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.\n\nThe FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.\n\nEvan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the\nPalmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it\nthreatens to turn on one of the switches.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON FINGERS\n</b>\nIn the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.\nAnd the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.\n\n\n<b>                         EVAN\n</b><b>\n</b>              Come on, come on...\n\nEvan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the\nSWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!\n\nEvan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against\nthe knife in the toaster.\n\nWhen the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,\nknocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.\n\nThe entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the\ndoor. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.\n\n\n<b>                       EVAN\n</b>              Jesus Christ!\n\nEvan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He\nbegins COUGHING in the smoke.\n\nEvan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the\nkitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire\nescape.\n\nHe dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears\na creak and looks up just as --\n\nA large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan\njumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire\ncompletely engulfs the kitchen.\n\nHe bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.\nHe runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.\n\nA LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick\nshrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest\nlevel, intact.\n\nHe tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges\nonce, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing\nand gently drops to the ground.\n\nSafe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --\n\nSUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his\nlegs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.\n\nThe rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming\nright for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!\n\nAs Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly\nPLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!\n\n<b>INT.

Three\n              months and you still haven't asked\n              my daughter out on a date.\n\nKimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.\n\n<b>                       THOMAS\n</b>              What's wrong with a platonic\n              relationship?\n\n<b>                       MR.

That's for ugly\n              women.\n\n<b>                       KIMBERLY\n</b>              For God's sake, leave him alone,\n              Dad.\n\n<b>                       THOMAS\n</b>                     (smiling)\n              Yeah, don't make me cite you for\n              harassment.\n\n<b>                       MR.

I'm not hurting anyone.\n                     (looking around, lowering\n                          voice)\n              Besides, if you can beat Death,\n<b>\n</b>             what's he got to worry about me\n             for?\n\nMr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,\nMRS. GIBBONS, joins.\n\n<b>                      MR. GIBBONS\n</b>             You know, you still never explained\n             to us how you did it.\n\nIt seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.\n\n<b>                      THOMAS\n</b>             Well, technically when we died, we\n             gave Death what it wanted. And by\n             the time we were revived, it had\n             already moved on to graver\n             pastures.\n\nMrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She\nchanges the conversation.\n\n<b>                      MRS. GIBBONS\n</b>             You know, I'm having the greatest\n             day?\n\n<b>                      KIMBERLY\n</b>             Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.\n             Big props to you and Brian.\n\n<b>                       MRS.

NYU, right?\n\n<b>                      KIMBERLY\n</b>             Three short glorious weeks away.\n\n<b>                      MRS. GIBBONS\n</b>             Sounds wonderful. I wish I were\n             going myself.\n\n<b>                      MR.

Our eldest daughter moved\n             there and came back with piercings\n             all over her face.\n                    (looks grave)\n             Among other places.\n\nA chorus of friendly laughter.\n\n<b>                      BRIAN (O.S.)\n</b>             Dad used to call her the\n             pincushion. From Hellraiser.\n\nBRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full\nof raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.\n<b>\n</b><b>                        BRIAN\n</b>               Dad, you had the spatula last,\n               right?\n\n<b>                        MR. GIBBONS\n</b>               Sure, here.\n\nMr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera,\nSLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between\nKimberly and Thomas' heads.\n\n<b>                        KIMBERLY\n</b>               Brian looks like he's having fun.\n\n<b>                        MR. GIBBONS\n</b>               Sure does. Owes it to that friend\n               of yours, in a way.\n\nMr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.\n\n<b>                        KIMBERLY\n</b>               How's that?\n\n<b>                        MR.

In the BG,\nBrian fidgets in front of the barbecue.\n\n<b>                        MRS. GIBBONS\n</b>               You never told me that, Peter.\n               Boy, that was lucky.\n\nBOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening\nsilence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons'\nplate.
