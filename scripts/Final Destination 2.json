BURROUGHS\n               Buckle up!\n\nMr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots\nan OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the\nstain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY\n\nON OLD WOMAN\n\nAs she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is\nshrill and disturbing.\n\nDRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered\nface as she passes.

She calls out to the driver in front:\n\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n               Sorry!   My fault!\n\nShaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and\nFRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his\nnose.\n\n\n                        SHAINA\n               Want me to drive?\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               No, I'm good.\n\nShaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.\nKimberly spins around, startled.\n\nKimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with\nchilling intensity.\n\nThe kids ad-lib \"Let's go\" and \"Fucking freak.\" The Old Woman's\nPLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The Old\n\nWoman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve\nthem.\n\nThe signal turns from red to flashing yellow.\n\nKimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view\nmirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.\n\n\n                       FRANKIE\n              Dano, shouldn't we go back and help\n              your mother?\n\n                            DANO\n              Blo w me.\n\nCU ON KIMBERLY\n\nAs she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic\nroad sign that flashes \"WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET\".\n\nNISSAN SUV\n\nKimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow\nmini- bus carrying a high- school football team.\n\nKimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's\nspeeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back\nleft, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.\n\nCLOSE.\n\nKimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle\neach other, yelling:\n\n\n                            FOOTBALL PLAYERS\n                 Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up!\n\nKimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at\nearsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and\nreach to lower the volume.\n\nKimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY\nCAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.\n\n\n                          DANO\n                 Christ, is this tribute to Princess\n                 Di Day or what?\n\nKimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into\nthe back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the\nwindow.\n\n\n                            KIMBERLY\n\n                     (unnerved)\n              Jesus, all the crazies are out\n              today.\n\nA CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around,\ntaking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.\n\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              I told you no drugs in the car!    My\n              dad will freak!\n\nDano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!\n\n\n                       DANO\n                     (laughs)\n              Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs,\n              just weed.\n\n                       FRANKIE\n              Yeah, you should have specified.\n\nKimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes\nwordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.\n\nThen Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.\n\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)\n              Kimberly? It's Dad.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Hey, Dad. What's up?\n\nDano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an\nunexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing\nat hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES\nHER TITS at Dano over:\n\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)\n              Your car's leaking either\n              transmission or brake fluid. I\n              want you to have it checked ASAP at\n              a gas station.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              You got it, Dad. I'll call you if\n              I have a problem.\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)\n              I mean it. Take care of it.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.\n\nKimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at\na map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top\nSHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.\n\n\n                        SHAINA\n               Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna\n               call like every ten minutes is he?\n\nBefore Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him.\nHe lowers the joint at once.\n\n\n                        DANO\n                      (hiding bag of weed in\n                           pants)\n               Shit! There's a cop behind us.\n               Pull into the right lane now!\n\nKimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding\nflat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !\n\nA HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A\nCOILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.\n\n\n                        DANO\n               Look first, idiot!\n\nShaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.\n\n\n                        SHAINA\n               Ignore 'em.\n\nON LOG TRUCK\n\nOne end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the\npavement, sparking.\n\nLooking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls\nin behind her.\n\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               Dano, put that out NOW.\n\nDano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It\nbounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.\n\nINSIDE THE EXPEDITION\n\nKAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and\nspeaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.\n\n\n                        KAT\n\n             No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I\n             won't be able to pitch the\n             campaign. Let's get Silverstein to\n             come in and...\n\nKat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her\nwindshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.\n\n\n                      KAT\n             What the hell?     No,   not you.\n\nKat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out\nthe joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing\nher vision.\n\nKat turns and looks at --\n\nDANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.\n\n\n                      DANO\n             What's the cop doing?      Did he see\n             that?\n\nKat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.\n\n\n                       KAT\n              Forget it, I'll call him myself.\n\nKat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a\nnumber...\n\nPAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE\n\nEarly 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.\n\nINSIDE THE POLICE CAR\n\nThomas speaks into his radio.\n\n\n                      THOMAS\n             I was supposed to be off today.\n             How did I get screwed?\n\n                       DISPATCHER (O.S.)\n              No biggie. Drake called in sick.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Copy that.\n                    (switches off; annoyed)\n             Go on, sleep it off Drake.\n\nThomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard,\nbut it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.\n\nThe VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and\ncloser to the edge of the dashboard.\n\nBACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV\n\nDano nervously looks back.\n\n\n                       FRANKIE\n              Relax, dude.\n\nBut Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard \"Check Engine\" light\nbegins flickering.\n\nKimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.\n\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             This trip better be wor th it.\n             What's the guy- girl ratio again?\n\n                      SHAINA\n             Get ready to smile, five guys per\n             girl.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              I can live with thaaaa --\n\nKimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her\nsuddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no\nreason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to\navoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.\n\n\n                       FRANKIE\n              What's your problem, ya fuckin'\n              crack baby?!\n\nINSIDE THE WHITE VAN\n\nISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van\nfull of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are\nmarked: In Memory of Flight 180.\n\nShe chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.\n\n\n                      ISABELLA\n             ...couldn't Keep your dick in check\n             for another month? I knew this\n             would happen when I got pregnant.\n\nShe pounds the steering wheel, furious.\n\n\n                       ISABELLA\n              What'd the doctor say? I have to\n              come in to test for STDs? Goddamn\n\n               you, Jorge.\n\nA CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry\nof sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise\nand, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals\nshower the visor of --\n\nEUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed\nbugs) around his visor and drops back.\n\nINSIDE NISSAN SUV\n\nKimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees\na TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing\nits side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.\n\nIt finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,\n\"DRUNK DRIVING KILLS.\"\n\nKimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter\nfrom the back seat.\n\nUp ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN\nagainst it.\n\nSuddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front\nof them causes everyone to roll up their windows.\n\nOIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS\nKimberly.\n\n\n                        FRANKIE\n               Gas it around these idiots. We do\n               have 1200 miles to go, you know.\n\nKimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a\nSUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically\nSMASHING two toy cars together.\n\nKimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars\nby, startling her.\n\nINSIDE PACER\n\nNORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with\ntwo ten-ounce Naya bottles.\n\n\n                        NORA\n               Tim, will you cut that out? I\n               can't even hear myself think.\n\nTim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.\n\n\n                        TIM\n\n              Damn, it really hurts, Mom.\n\n                       NORA\n              I know, we'll be there soon.\n\nTim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to\nthe floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.\n\nINSIDE NISSAN SUV\n\nKimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on\nthe left. Frankie rolls down his window.\n\n\n                       FRANKIE\n                     (yells to driver)\n              Ever hear of the Ozone layer,\n              asshole?\n\nINSIDE CHEVETTE\n\nRORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD\ncase. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he\nreflexively taps the brakes.\n\nRory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and\nnonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.\n\nINSIDE NISSAN SUV\n\nShe has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running\ndown along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.\n\nUp ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull\ninto the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with\nlogs.\n\nINSIDE THE COP CAR\n\nAs Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches\nforward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.\n\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Son of a bitch.\n\nINSIDE TRANS AM\n\nIts driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly,\nclearly making Frankie jealous.\n\n\n                       FRANKIE\n              A Trans Am. That shit went out\n              with New Kids on the Block.\n\n                       DANO\n\n              Yeah. Who does he think he is?\n              Knight Rider?\n\n                       FRANKIE\n                     (laughs; then)\n              Who?\n\nFrankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.\n\n\n                       DANO\n              You know, Hasselhoff before he did\n              Baywatch.\n\nEvan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear\naround the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.\n\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              What's the chance of finding a nice\n              mature guy once we get to Daytona?\n\n                       SHAINA\n              How does a nice mature fuck sound?\n\nKimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina.\n\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Hey, thanks for talking    me into\n              this trip. Ever since     my mom... I\n              dunno, I just feel like    I'm\n              starting to live again,    you know?\n\nShaina smiles in understanding.\n\nINSIDE POLICE CRUISER\n\nThomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he\ntries to soak up the coffee.\n\nSuddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side\nof the truck onto the highway.\n\nOne bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and\nout the back, taking Thomas' head with it.\n\nEUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED\nto the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right\nin front of the yellow mini-bus.\n\nThe MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS\ntumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides\noff the road onto the grass median.\n\nHe blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING\nseveral times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a\nMACK TRUCK.\n\nEugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.\nOnly to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.\n\nRory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas\ntank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield\nwhere it remains half in/half onto the hood.\n\nKAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from\nthe Chevette.\nShe swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a\nhuge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the\nExpedition end over end right next to Kimberly.\n\nKimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a\nhuge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but\nhits it broadside --\n\nSending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the\nroad. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag\ndolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the\nside window.\n\nKimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her\nmangled but still alive friends and up in time to see\n\nNORA'S PACER\n\nNora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen\nNaya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of\nKat's Expedition.\n\nThe crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a\nhuge fireball.\n\nEVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his\nTrans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.\n\nKimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF\nFIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still\nalive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to\nrelease the seatbelt.\n\nThen, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh\nthe wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it\nlike a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.\n\nKIMBERLY'S POV\n\nThe semi's grill comes right at her!\n\nCU ON KIMBERLY\n\nShe screams and we --\n\nCUT TO:\n\nTHE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER\n\nSweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her\nsurroundings...\n\n\n                      DANO (O.S.)\n             Flight 180.

The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly\nleans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van,\nthe Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile\nup. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.\n\n\n                         SHAINA\n\n              Relax, you need to chill the fuck\n              out.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.\n\n                       SHAINA\n              For Christ sakes girl, take a\n              breath.\n\n                       D.J.

Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.\n\n                        THOMAS\n               What's going on here?\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n                      (incoherent, through\n                           tears)\n               There's going to be a pile up.\n               Logs.

It happened.\n\nThomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, \"we don't know her.\"\n\n\n                        THOMAS\n               Miss, please step out of the\n               vehicle.\n\nAs she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously\neyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the\npregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her\nfriendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.\n\n\n                        ISABELLA\n               Excuse me, but is there some way we\n               could just drive around?

What's\n               going on?\n\nAs she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and\npulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school\nteacher in cool leathers.\n\nINSIDE PACER\n\nNORA watches the SUV, distressed.\n\n\n                        NORA\n               What on Earth are they doing?\n\n                        TIM\n                      (picking up two Naya\n                           bottles)\n               Who am I, David Blane?\n\nNora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles.

THOMAS isn't\nquite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and\nFrankie, no help, stare dead ahead.\n\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n                    (trying to calm herself)\n             The radio played the same songs,\n             the old lady's bag broke the exact\n             same way it did in my premonition.\n\nKimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.\nShe grabs at Thomas for emphasis.\n\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             THAT's the truck that's going to\n             kill everyone!\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Alright miss, calm down.

In the distance. It's\nneverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in\nhorror and collapses against the SUV.\n\nThomas runs to his patrol car.\n\nThe White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and\nSPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into\nher cell phone.\n\n\n                       ISABELLA\n              You couldn't keep your dick in\n              check for a month?!\n\nThe other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's\nhappened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke.\n\n\n                       KAT\n              Great, now I'm really gonna be\n              late.\n\nThomas barks into the radio handset --\n\n\n                       THOMAS\n              L.A. 51, I need assistance and\n              requesting paramedics for a major\n              T.A.

As she leans her head into\nShaina's window, an ominous BREEZE blows back their hair and we hear\nthe BLARING HORN of a TRUCK.\n\nAnd Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas!\n\nFrom nowhere, a SHRIEK of BRAKES as a JACK-KNIFED TRUCK plow s the SUV\nacross the frame! CRASH! Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by\ninches!\n\nKimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up\nin the wreckage.\n\nEXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nINT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS\n\nCHAOS.

And somehow I knew\n             something horrible was going to\n             happen, even before it did.\n\nSomething clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly,\nlike a lawyer leading a friendly witness.\n\n\n                      THOMAS\n             You knew?

All the songs on\n              the radio were about car crashes.\n              Some kid's banging toy cars\n              together.\n                  (lookin g at her)\n              She was dialing her cell phone with\n              her headset on.\n                  (points to Rory)\n              His car was leaking oil all over\n              the road.\n\n                       RORY\n              Hey, don't be knockin' the\n              Chevette.\n\nBut the others listen intently now.

That would be\n              irresponsible and unprofessional.\n\nDetective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable.\n\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Look, you weren't there. It was\n              weird. She knew that log truck was\n              gonna cause an accident, she knew.\n                  (beat)\n              Never mind.\n\n                       DETECTIVE SUBY\n              I thought we we re finished with\n              this bullshit. This is police\n              work, not the psychic Hot Line.\n\nBut Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When\nDetective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens.\n\n\n                       KIMBER LY\n              But if I was never meant to pull\n              over, then we all should have died\n              in the pile up.\n\n                       TIM\n              Which means Death could be coming\n              for us.\n\nDetective Suby looks pissed o ff.\n\n\n                       DETECTIVE SUBY\n              Way to console the witnesses Burke.\n\nAt the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket\nand wave goodbye to the others.\n\n\n                       DETECTIVE SUBY\n              You got 'em thinking Death is after\n              them? Shit, they're the luckiest\n              sons o' bitches on the planet. Get\n              this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday\n              the kid wins the lotto and today\n              some looney bitch b locks traffic\n              and he avoids the worst pile up in\n              years. I should be so damn\n              unlucky.\n\nINT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nKimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what\nthey've heard.\n\n\n                       KAT\n\n               What if it's true? What if it's\n               happening all over again?\n\nThe fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed,\nstands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm.\n\n\n                        NORA\n               You're all certifiable, you know\n               that? I can't believe I've been\n               listening to this crap. Come on,\n               Tim, let's go outside.\n\n                        TIM\n               Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.\n\n                        EUGENE\n               Look lady, we're just yankin' your\n               chain.\n\n                        RORY\n               Yeah, you're acting like we all\n               just got the Diff'rent Strokes\n               curse or something.\n\nEugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted.\n\n\n                        NORA\n               What's wrong with you people?\n\nNora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door,\nthe others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to\ncalm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence.\nSuddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside.\nMr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.\n\n\n                        MR. BURROUGHS\n               Kimberly...\n\nThe sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam\nburst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest,\nsobbing.\n\n\n                        MR. BURROUGHS\n               Can I take her home?\n\nThomas nods.\n\n\n                        DETECTIVE SUBY\n               Sure, you can all go.\n\nBy now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat\nand Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless.\n\n                      KAT\n             First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now\n             this nonsense.\n\n                      RORY\n             Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya,\n             but I've been over this X-Files\n             shit since the sixth season.\n\nAs Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then\nDARKNESS.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nKimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea\nbefore her. Both are shaken.\n\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             I know it's crazy, but I'm really\n             scared for the others. I've got\n             this terrible feeling.\n\n                      MR. BURROUGHS\n             What feeling?\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             That it's not over yet.\n\nShe picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands.\n\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS\n             Don 't worry. Everything will be\n             fine, you'll see.\n\nINT. EVAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY\n\nA dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. Evan\nappears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some\npackages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he\nclimbs.\n\nThe stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK\napparently left by some kids.\n\nAs Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing\nEvan to lean against -\n\nTHE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan\nslowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.\n\n\n                      EVAN\n             Motherfucker.\n\nA HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward\nthe center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just\nmisses it!\n\nHe continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -\n\nThe Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and\nhe slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself\nand continues down the hallway.\n\nINT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\nDim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small\npackages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.\n\nEvan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,\nwho cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing\nhis PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to\nthe fridge and grabs a drink.\n\nIn the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a\ngrease-filled frying pan.\n\nEvan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the\nsidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --\n\nAnd a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide\nforward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.\n\nEvan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the\nfrying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts\nthe frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.\n\nHe then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter\nnext to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out\nHEY E.\n\nPUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -\nthe word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the\nmicrowave and turns it on.\n\nANGLE ON STOVE\n\nThe cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his\nanswering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his\npackages...\n\n\n                       VOICE (O.S.)\n              Dude! You suck! You buy one\n              fucking ticket in your whole life\n              and win twenty grand? We're going\n              whoring in Prague, you know this!\n                     (whisper)\n              Hold on, the boss is coming.\n\nA CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.\n\nANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And\nugly sound.\n\nAs many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He\nslides it over his wrist, admiring it.\n\nANGLE ON KNIFE\n\nLazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about\nan inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.\n\nBy now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond\nencrusted horseshoe ring.\n\nHe carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is\nFLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION\nfrom the microwave startles him.\n\nThe RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!\n\n\n                         EVAN\n              Damn it!\n\nEvan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When\nhe tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.\n\nAnother small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the\nGLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.\n\nFlames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil\nfrom the pan IGNITES. A small fire.\n\nEvan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE\nslowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He\ncontinues yanking... Stuck.\n\nHe sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His\nfingers reach for it.\n\nSlightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to\nknock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.\n\nThe FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.\n\nEvan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the\nPalmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it\nthreatens to turn on one of the switches.\n\nANGLE ON FINGERS\n\nIn the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.\nAnd the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.\n\n\n                         EVAN\n\n              Come on, come on...\n\nEvan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the\nSWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!\n\nEvan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against\nthe knife in the toaster.\n\nWhen the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,\nknocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.\n\nThe entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the\ndoor. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.\n\n\n                       EVAN\n              Jesus Christ!\n\nEvan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He\nbegins COUGHING in the smoke.\n\nEvan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the\nkitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire\nescape.\n\nHe dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears\na creak and looks up just as --\n\nA large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan\njumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire\ncompletely engulfs the kitchen.\n\nHe bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.\nHe runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.\n\nA LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick\nshrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest\nlevel, intact.\n\nHe tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges\nonce, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing\nand gently drops to the ground.\n\nSafe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --\n\nSUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his\nlegs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.\n\nThe rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming\nright for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!\n\nAs Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly\nPLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!\n\nINT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's\nwatching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.\n\nTen websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas\nscrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180\n\"survivors\".\n\nHeadlines blare, \"Freak Accident?\" \"Bizarre Coincidence?\" describing\nthe way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the\nword, \"PREMONITION\" --\n\nSPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.\n\nThomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder,\nhumming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to\nhis forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.\n\n\n                      DETECTIVE SUBY\n                    (as if entranced)\n             Ooooh, I see it now. Your\n             future... A transfer to another\n             department.\n\nSuby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas,\nembarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.\n\n\n                       THOMAS\n              You've made your point.\n\n                      DETECTIVE SUBY\n             Good. Cause we just got some new\n             info and I don't ne ed you getting\n             freaky on me.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             What?\n\n                      DETECTIVE SUBY\n             Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he\n             wasn't as lucky as we thought.\n\nDetective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas\nlooks stunned.\n\nINT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nKat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and\ncrushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream.\n\n\n                      KAT\n             No, Mom. Just turn on any station,\n             they've been playing it all day.\n                    (beat; rolls her eyes)\n             Yes, Mother. Channel four will do\n             just fine. Here it is, gotta go.\n\nShe hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:\n\nFOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage.\n\n\n                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)\n             Route 18 was backed up for almost\n             nine hours today when a record\n             breaking pile up...\n\nINT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nNora and Tim watch the same report.\n\n\n                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)\n             ...killed An estimated 18 people.\n             Emergency crews spent hours sifting\n             through the wreckage.\n\nINT. EUGENE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nEugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch.\n\n\n                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)\n             ...hoping To recover any survivors\n             from this tragic collision. So\n             far, the police are refusing to\n             release the names of the victims\n             until their families are notified.\n\nINT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly\nenter behind him from the kitchen.\n\n\n                      ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)\n             The camera of a highway patrol car\n             managed to catch this shocking\n             footage --\n\nB/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to\nthe ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV.\n\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS\n              My Lord...\n\nA GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting\nback tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV --\nbut she stops him.\n\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n              Don't.   I have to see this.\n\nMr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on.\n\nINT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\nIt's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist\nat the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn\neverywhere.\n\n\n                     RORY\n             Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right\n             there? That's my fuckin' car right\n             there! Oh God, that's dope.\n\nAfter high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a\nfreshly chopped line.\n\n\n                      ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)\n             In other news, a freak accident\n             took the life of a lotto winner.\n\nRory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the\nreport, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a\ntrain.\n\nMONTAGE\n\nOf Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the\nnews very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by\nEMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to\ngrading blue books.\n\nTIM'S BEDROOM - LATER\n\nTim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in.\n\n\n                      NORA\n             Come on, Tim, lights out already.\n\nTim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book.\n\n\n                        TIM\n             Mom?\n\n                        NORA\n             Yeah?\n\n                      TIM\n             You think... You think those guys\n             were b.s.-ing us today or what?\n\nNora swallows, trying to seem brave.\n\n                      NORA\n             Oh, please. Some people just need\n             some serious rewiring, that's all.\n\nBut neither of them are convinced.\n\n\n                      NORA\n             Get some sleep.\n\nNora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim\nopens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs\nit in.\n\nINT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nNora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the\ncloset and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business\ncard and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again.\n\n\n                       NORA\n              Officer Burke, please?\n\nINT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nMr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his\nhands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.\n\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten\n             anymore.\n\nMr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective.\n\n\n                      MR. BURROUGHS\n             I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that\n             you're safe.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight.\n\nBut Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink.\n\n\n                      MR. BURROUGHS\n             You know, after your mother died...\n\nKimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.\n\n\n                      MR. BURROUGHS\n             There were so many times I didn't\n             think I could last another day. I\n             can't even tell you some of the\n\n               things I th ought about.\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               I used to have those feelings, too.\n               But that's when I'd think of Mom.\n               Her strength...and courage. And\n               I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to\n               be as brave as she was. And the\n               bad thoughts would go away.\n\n                        MR. BURROUGHS\n                      (choking up)\n               I don't know what I'd do if I lost\n               you.\n\nMr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as\nhe's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING\nout of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr.\nBurroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there\nis none. And he leaves.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and\nturns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A\nporch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety.\n\nA BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in\nbed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the\ncandle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of\na...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again.\n\nHeadlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling.\nShadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL.\n\nKimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from\nthe VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.\n\nShe can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and\nflicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously\nturns on her computer.\n\nEXT.

And a HAND reaches into frame\nand pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth.\n\nREVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to\nmake sure nobody saw...\n\nEXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER\n\nNora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A\nCRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back.\n\nFrom across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas\nappear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming.\n\n                        TIM\n               What are they doing here? And why\n               are they yelling \"pigeons\"?\n\nJust then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who\nsuddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand\ninadvertently jerks a lever -\n\nA METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE\nSHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his\nmangled body visible underneath.\n\nAs two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER\n\nEmergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks\nback to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a\nstretcher into an ambulance.\n\n                        THOMAS\n                      (shaking his head)\n               Nora's not coming. She refuses to\n               leave her son.\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               We have to tell her she's in\n               danger!\n\n                        THOMAS\n                      (sadly)\n               I did. And right now, I don't\n               think she cares.\n\nEXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her\nhand and watches it tremble.\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               It's happening again.   It's fucking\n\n              happening again. I hoped we'd get\n              there and they'd be okay, that\n              Clear Rivers was full of shit and\n              Evan's death was just a freak\n              accident...\n\nThomas kills the engine to listen.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              But we're all going to die. We\n              can't stop it. It's just a matter\n              of time. I'm so scared.\n\nThomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              I am too. But you can use that\n              fear. It'll sharpen your\n              instincts. Keep you alert fro\n              signs. It's the only way you'll be\n              able to sav e the others...and me.\n\nKimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses\nhe's losing her, and softens her approach.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              I know you didn't ask for any of\n              this, Kimberly. But I don't think\n              you have it in you to quit either.\n\nKimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in.\nBANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car.\n\nKimberly jumps, then spins around to see:\n\nCLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful\npresence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear\nstare each other down.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.\n\nClear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n                     (bitter)\n              The second one just dies.   A 16\n              year old kid.\n\n                       CLEAR\n                     (nods; a faint trace of\n                          guilt)\n              I hope you're ready for this.\n\n\nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY\n\nThomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly,\nThomas and Clear file out and head to the door.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              This is cheery.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Who is this guy, anyway?\n\n                       CLEAR\n              A mortician. He seemed to know a\n              hell of a lot more about death than\n              he ever told us.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Should we knock?\n\n                        CLEAR\n                      (looking ill)\n              He probably already knows we're\n              coming.\n\nINT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER\n\nKimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small\nchapel, creat ing a loud CREAK. A corpse in an open casket sits at the\nfront of the chapel, post -wake.\n\nKimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to\nget to a side door.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER\n\nThe three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.\nAn ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of\na furnace make it all the more eerie.\n\nAs they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the\nshadow of a figure looms against a steel oven.\n\nThey edge closer. They peek inside the --\n\nINT. CREMATORIUM\n\nOddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a\nmomentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all!\n\nThey jump back - bumping right into:\n\nMR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has\ninexplicably appear BEHIND THEM.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an\n              eye out for you.\n\nThe mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY\ntoward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.\n\nClear, however, seems to expect nothing less.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              Come to... Pick my brain?\n\nThe Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's\nmouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards\nthe bloody tooth on a metal tray.\n\n                      MORTICIAN\n                    (to Kimberly)\n             Flesh and bone require 1,600\n             degrees for cremation. Gold,\n             prosthetics and other metals must\n             be removed before the final --\n\n                       CLEAR\n                     (not falling for this\n                          again)\n             Just a simple question and we'll\n             leave you alone with your new\n             friend.\n\nThe Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and\nhits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze.\n\n                      MORTICIAN\n             Fire away.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             How do you cheat Death once and for\n             all?\n\nThe Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down\nto sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.\n\n                        MORTICIAN\n              Dead.   But still fresh.\n\nKimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear\nhas had about enough.\n\n                      CLEAR\n                    (to the Mortician)\n             Look, we drove a long way to get\n             here. So if you happen to know how\n             to get this death monkey off our\n             backs, it sure would be swell if\n             you told us.\n\nThe Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              For what purpose? You seek a back\n              way out of a room with but one\n              door. You can't cheat Death; there\n\n              are no escapes.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              Bullshit. You told me Death has a\n              distinct design, a blueprint,\n              unalterable. But Alex and I\n              cheated Death not once, but dozens\n              of times. If the design is flawed,\n              it can be beaten.\n\nA sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring\nOFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't\nflinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              Such fire in you now. People are\n              always most alive just before they\n              die. Don't you think?\n\nClear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              It can be beaten.   And you know it.\n\nCREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven.\n\n                        MORTICIAN\n              Some say that there is a balance to\n              everything. An equilibrium that is\n              the connective tissue of the\n              universe. They say that for every\n              lif e there is a death, and for\n              every death a life...\n\nHis words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters.\n\n                        MORTICIAN\n              Solus novus anima licet evinco\n              mortis; Only new life can defeat\n              death.\n                     (off their confusion)\n              The list of life is forever set by\n              the Divine Plan, the guiding hand\n              that plots the course of the\n              universe, down to its tiniest\n              element s.\n\nThomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses\non Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              The list accounts for every life;\n              from the dawn of man to the great\n              apocalypse. But the introduction\n              of life that was not meant to be, a\n              soul forbidden to roam the earth,\n              that could invalidate Death's list,\n              shatter its very existence.\n\nEvan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              What the hell does that mean?\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n                     (with finality)\n              To figure that out you'll have to\n              follow the sign s.\n\nThe Mortician grabs Kimberly.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n              But be warned. To disrupt the\n              grand design is to unravel the\n              tapestry of the universe. When you\n              pull all the threads apart, you may\n              find yourself hanging from them.\n\nThe Mortician finally lets Kimberly go.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              One last question. Why is Death\n              working backwards this time?\n\nThe Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex.\n\n                       MORTICIAN\n                     (shakes head; a sick\n                          smile)\n              Sorry, time's up.\n\nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY\n\nCLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING\n\nFrom the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for\nsigns of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY\nCUT-OFF VALVE\n\nSome SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by\nKimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              New life defeats death?

If we can use your ability\n              to see the signs, we can cheat\n              Death long enough to figure out\n              what \"new life\" means.\n                     (off their looks)\n              I know, it worries me that I\n\n                understand him.\n\nThomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground.

Put it back on.\n\nClear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              Make sure all these people will be\n              at the meeting tonight.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Taken care of.\n\nTHE MONITOR\n\nBack, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down\nthe onramp.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              There it is.\n\n                        THOMAS\n              Got it.\n\nThomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past\nthe White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot.\n\nAs Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate\nnumber, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame\nby frame.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              I don't get it. Why is everything\n              happening so fast? After Flight\n              180. A month went by before anyone\n              died. And now five people are dead\n              in less than a day.\n\nThomas' computer screen finally fills with information.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Here we go. The vehicle's a\n              delivery van registered to Jorge\n              and Isabella Cruz. And Christ,\n              there's almost a dozen domestic\n              disturbance complaints on these\n              two.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              We need to hurry.\n\nThey all get up and leave.\n\nOminously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's\nPacer - a white van!\n\nINT. CRUZ HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and\nClear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see\nwhere they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning\nthe walkway.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Let's lay this on her gently now.\n             The stress alone could upset the\n             pregnancy.\n\nKimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when\nAUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.\n\nAll three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate\nfrom within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.\n\nBut nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and\nas if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and\npurposefully to the front door.\n\nHe makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a\nROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at\nthe last second by its owner -\n\nJORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's\nBARKING:\n\n                       JORGE\n             What?\n\n                      THOMAS\n             I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for\n             an Isabella Cruz.\n\nSuddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog.\n\n                      JORGE\n             Shut up!!!\n\nThe Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it\nlands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once\nagain pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.\n\nJorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Are you Jorge Cruz?\n\n                        JORGE\n              Maybe.   What's this about?\n\n                       THOMAS\n              May we come in?\n\n                       JORGE\n             No.   What's this about?\n\nANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile\nfloor. She takes in what she can see of --\n\nTHE ROOM\n\nAs if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn.\nFurniture over-turned.\n\n                       THOMAS\n                     (a little stern)\n              It's about your wife, Isabella.\n              Now is she here?\n\nJorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.\n\n                        JORGE\n              No.   I'm alone.\n\nBut by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares\nthrough the house, into a bedroom and sees -\n\nA FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Look, pal, it's probably nothing.\n              But I need to see --\n\nJorge is already closing the door.\n\n                       JORGE\n              Forget it. You'll need a warrant.\n              I know, I'm a lawyer.\n\nClear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past\nJorge's grasp.\n\n                        JORGE\n              Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!!\n\nClear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to\nthe floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes\na closer look at Clear.\n\n                       YOUNG WOMAN\n              We never meant to hurt you\n              Isa...You're not Isabella!\n\nMeanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas.\n\n                       JORGE\n              I'm going to sue your ass!\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              Whose blood is that on the floor?\n\nDefensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut.\n\n                        JORGE\n               Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts\n               this afternoon. Now arrest her!\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               Where's Isabella? Did you finally\n               kill her you fucking wife beater?\n\nJorge flinches. It's time to come clean.\n\n                        JORGE\n               We had a fight. Some things got\n               broken, the dog went crazy, she\n               left me. Wouldn't say where she\n               was going.\n\n                        THOMAS\n               What was the fight about?\n\n                        JORGE\n               Take a guess.\n\n                        THOMAS\n               Does she have a cell phone?

Let's just get to the\n               meeting.\n\nJorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.\n\n                        JORGE\n               Hey, when you find her, tell her\n               the kid's half mine.\n\nClear mutters something as they exit the house.\n\n                        CLEAR\n               We can only pray it doesn't come\n               out retarded.\n\nJorge hisses something at the Rotty, which CHARGES them and SPRINGS!\nBut Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nRory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up\nat the address. He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes\nhis nostrils free of crystals. He takes a breath and exits the car.\n\nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nRory follows some PEOPLE into the elevator.

The doors open. The man hurries out and the elevator DOORS\nCLOSE on Rory's smirking face.\n\nHARD CUT TO:\n\nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - LATER\n\nREVEAL - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch. It's obvious\nthe bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. Clear and Kimberly await\ntheir reactions.

He uses a GRABBER - a long pole with\nmovable claw on the end - to OPEN THE SKYLIGHT. When done, he\nbalances the long pole precariously against the wall.\n\nAn OMINOUS BREEZE enters. Clear notices MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over\nthe desk by the couch.\n\n                      NORA\n             So that would mean...

The hatred is mutual. Clear reaches for\na nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing MAGAZINE PAGES blowing\nover until their weight tips over a PENCIL HOLDER which spills pens\nout. She takes the box to Nora.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             You're not next, Nora. Nobody has\n             to be next. That's the point.\n             Last time, we didn't plan. We\n             weren't organized. Now we can help\n             each other.\n\nShe reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the\nothers.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             Think what would have happened if\n             Kimberly had been able to warn you\n             with the word pigeons...\n\nNora's head falls. Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             The point is, as long as you know\n             what to beware of, you have a\n             fighting chance.

A place where\n             no subway could possibly go, get\n             it?\n\nEveryone nods in understanding. Rory fidgets, sniffling, then POUNDS\nthe table in frustration.

He then lowers his\ngaze and sees --\n\nThe figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of\nwire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.\nOddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array.\n\nFrom Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man\nwith hooks emanating from his body.

She tries\ntying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell\nphone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then\nlooks embarrassed.\n\n                      EUGENE\n             Probably for you, anyway.\n\nNora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES.

And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends.\n\nClear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs\nto the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail.\n\nAll Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try\nto pull her back down.\n\nThe elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down\ninto Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering\naway as the body convulses.\n\nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR\n\nEugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A\nbloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head,\nstill aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.\n\nThe sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND\nPOUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator.\n\nINT.

He tries\nthe ignition, pumps the gas. Nothing...\n\nOnly by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding\nup the hill toward him. He jumps down and frantically tires starting\nthe tractor. Once, twice, nothing.\n\nEXT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS\n\nCU FRONT TIRE - METAL shreds away more rubber.\n\nINT.

Even Eugene looks concerned.\n\n                      EUGENE\n             Are you okay?\n\nThe car becomes completely silent (except for the slight SCRAPING) as\nKimberly prepares to tell her story.\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             A little over a year ago, my mother\n             and I went to the mall. I was\n             supposed to meet her outside, but I\n             got caught up watching some news\n             report about some kid who committed\n             suicide. I kept thinking, \"How can\n             you strangle yourself in a\n             bathtub?\" That's retarded.\n\nThomas mouths, \"Tod?\" to Clear. Clear nods.\n\n                          KIMBERLY\n                 It felt wrong. And yet...\n                        (continuing)\n                 There were gunshots outside and I\n                 ran...\n                        (chokes up)\n                 Some kids tried to jack her car.\n                 She fought them off - she was a\n                 fighter - and they killed her.\n\nKimberly looks to Clear.\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n             After the funeral I had this\n             overwhelming feeling that it should\n             have been me. I figured that's how\n             everyone must feel. But I guess I\n             was right.\n\nThomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand. As he\nlooks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a\ncigarette.\n\nINTERCUT BRIAN\n\nThe tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a\ncord and starts up the whoodchipper.\n\nINT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS\n\n                      CLEAR\n             It's all starting to come together.\n             When Alex got us off Flight 180, it\n             didn't just change our lives. It\n\n               affected everyone and everything\n               we've come into contact with ever\n               since.\n\n                        EUGENE\n               I'm not sure I understand.\n\n                        CLEAR\n               Being alive after our time caused\n               an outward ripple - a rift in\n               Death's design.\n\nEugene nods, slowly getting it.\n\n                        EUGENE\n               So if you never got off the plane,\n               none of us would be ali ve in the\n               first place.\n\n                        CLEAR\n               That's why Death is working\n               backwards.

Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk\nSHOOTS from the spout --\n\nThe airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve\nveers out of control.\n\nKat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly\njerks the wheel to the right.\n\nKat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire\nSUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the\noncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van!\n\nIsabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van\nhas a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road\ntoward a LAKE!\n\n                          STEVE\n               Hang on!\n\nThe SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the\nembankment, spinning and rolling towards --\n\nTHE GIBBONS' FARM\n\nAt the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits\nat the edge of the property!\n\nThe SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it!\n\nINSIDE THE SUV\n\nAll Kat can do is cover her head with her arms.\n\nTHE WHITE VAN\n\nSpeeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The\nWhite Van is ready for splashdown.\n\nSteve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's\nable to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard\njerk.\n\n                         STEVE\n                We're okay, we're okay.\n\nTHE PROPANE TANK\n\nIt's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely\nmisses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary\nfence and right into --\n\nAN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE!\n\nThe Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation\nditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere.\n\nJust as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS\nthrough the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory --\ncoming to a rest just behind Kat's head.\n\nINSIDE THE WHITE VAN\n\nSteve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows\ndown. Isabella squeezes his hand white.\n\n                          ISABELLA\n                Please.   It's not going to wait.\n\n                         STEVE\n                I've got to stop and help those\n                people.\n\n                          ISABELLA\n                 Do you want to deliver this baby?\n\nSteve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He\nfloors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio.\n\nTHE EXPEDITION\n\nThe dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET\nWHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL\nSPIKE that skewers the vehicle.\n\nRory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it.\nKimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to\nopen the door, but it won't budge.\n\n                       KAT\n              Not my time.

GIBBONS' FARM - DAY\n\nBRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward\nthe accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made\nfrom wooden posts bridged by two thick wires.\n\nBrian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK\nTREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a\ndouble-wide construction trailer.\n\n                        MR. GIBBONS (O.S.)\n              Call 9- 1-1!\n\nWE FOLLOW BRIAN\n\nTo the crash site. Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight\nof a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to\nperform CPR on him.\n\nAround Brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Stop it, don't move him!\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n\n               He can't breathe damn it.

Into the street --\n\nAnd Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an AMBULANCE SPEEDS\nonto the property.\n\n                        RORY\n               Watch it, dude!\n\nThat SNAPS Brian back to reality. Sounds become normal again. Brian\ncollects himself and SNIFFS the air. He then drops to ground level,\nlooking under the Expedition for something.\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               Help us, we need help over here!\n\n                        BRIAN\n                      (to Kat, reassuringly)\n               I don't smell any gas. And none's\n               dripping, either.\n\nBrian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped\nleg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick\nflannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all\nhis might.\n\nNo good, Kat SCREAMS in pain.\n\n                        KAT\n               Stop that! I still need this foot,\n               thank you.\n\nBrian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

Oh, watch\n             for potholes and puddles.\n\nAs Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to\nignore her.

She quickly WRESTLES herself free of the hose and\nwatches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             One more thing.   Watch out for\n             power lines.\n\nThe doors slam, revealing the PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL logo. The\nambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her.\n\nShe reaches into her pocket and withdraws a CRUSHED cell phone.

The gas tank\nPUNCTURES.\n\nEMT'S angrily wave the news van back to the road, where it parks near\nthe twin wire fence opposite the DEAD OAK TREE.\n\nImmediately, A CAMERA CREW exits the van to catch the action. Rory\nsteps behind the News Van, making sure he can't be seen, and digs\ninto his sock, coming up with a bindle.

Enraptured, he\ndelicately unfolds it...\n\nKIMBERLY\n\nIs put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the\nWINDOW of an emergency vehicle.

And\npops up twenty feet closer to the News Van.\n\nKimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas\nstands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas\nsees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety.\n\nClear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             Get back!\n\nBOOM! The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over\nThomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between\nthem. The flying garrote heads directly for --\n\nRory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is\nsliced into three sharp cuts of beef.\n\nThe silence from the emergency crew is deafening.

Right now!\n\nFinally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to\nswaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking\nIsabella.\n\n                       OBSTETRICIAN\n              Isabella, look down and see your\n              son.\n\nTo the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST\nINTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other.\n\nIt's a magical moment --\n\nEXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense\nrelief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt\npocket and lighting a victory cigar.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\nRelaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the\ndelivery room as Clear runs up to them.\n\n                      CLEAR\n             A guard grabbed me before I could\n             find Eugene.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Don't sweat it.

Flatlined!\n\n                        THOMAS (O.S.)\n               Kimberly! Are you okay?!\n\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT\n\nKimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her\ntrance. Thomas helps her to her feet.\n\n                        THOMAS\n               Are you okay?

Clear sees TWO\nSECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others\ntoward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE.\n\n                        CLEAR\n               What did you see?\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n               I was dead.

She was on the onramp.\n\nKimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nPREVIOUSLY UNSEEN\n\nMoment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly\nsuddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.\n\nKimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an\naccident.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKimberly, overcome with self- doubt.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              I'm not sure... I don't think\n              Isabella was ever destined to die\n              in the pile -up.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              Then what's the premonition of the\n              lake supposed to mean?\n\n                       CLEAR\n              Can you remember anything about it?\n\nKimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:\n\nEXT. LAKE - DAY\n\nPOV DRIVER\n\nGrease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van\nspeeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!\n\nThe van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In\nmoments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.\nDrowning. Horrible.\n\nAnd on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              ...the Same hands from the van.\n\nFinally everything makes sense to Clear.\n\n                       CLEAR\n              It's you Kimberly. The\n              premonitions are about you.\n\nKimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing.\n\n                        KIMBERLY\n              No!   It can't be.\n\n                       CLEAR\n                     (suddenly remembering)\n              I have to save Eugene!\n\nClear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together. Kimberly verges on tears\nand Thomas consoles her with a hug.\n\nIN THE BACKGROUND\n\nClear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor.\nShe comes to a room with a HUGE CART parked outside, blocking the\ndoor. She looks up to see - B -187.\n\nClear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.\n\n                           CLEAR\n                Eugene?    Are you in there?\n\nEUGENE'S ROOM\n\nEugene strains to hear through the thick door.\n\n                         CLEAR (O.S.)\n                Can you hear me? I'm coming in .\n\nAn intense wave of relief washes over Eugene.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nAs Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the\ndoor.\n\n                         ORDERLY (O.S.)\n                Make way, make way lovebirds.\n\nKimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a\ncrossword book in one hand, A BIRTHDAY CAKE in the other.\n\nThe CAKE reads \"Happy Birthday Gregory\". The THIRTEEN SPARKLING\nCANDLES on top ODDLY FRAME Clear's head.\n\n                           KIMBERLY\n                Oh no...\n\nThe Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches\nfor Eugene's door handle. She leans into it --\n\n                         ORDERLY\n                       (to Clear)\n                Thanks hon, the Henzels are going\n                crazy for this thing.\n\nTHOMAS AND KIMBERLY\n\nWatch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of\nOxygen --\n\nBOOM!!!\n\nClear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA,\nheading straight for Kimberly and Thomas!\n\nThomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being\ncrushed by Clear's lifeless body!\n\nThe hospital erupts in total chaos. Just as Kimberly is about to\nbreak down completely, she sees --\n\nA WOMAN hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash\ncart.\n\nKimberly sees the nametag: KALARJIAN.\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n                Nurse Kalarjian...\n\n                         DR.

And then Dr. Kalarjian passes them\ntoward the area of the explosion.\n\nKIMBERLY OMINOUSLY TURNS, the camera following her view, until she\nsees a small lake across the street from the hospital.\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n                Oh my God. That's it. The lake.\n                The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.\n\n                         THOMAS\n                What?\n\nJust then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS\njump out and run towards the blast site.\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n                You can't cheat destiny. I know\n                what I have to do to save us. I\n                have to die.\n\n                         THOMAS\n                That's crazy. You can't give up\n                now. We can still fight this\n                thing.\n\nBut Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at\nthe --\n\nAMBULANCE\n\nA red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six\nfloral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from\nher vision! And it's running!\n\n                         KIMBERLY\n                I have to do this.\n\nKimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns\nand runs before he can speak.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\n\nKimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost\nseems to swing open for her as she gets in.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\n\nThomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which\nSPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\n\nKimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the\ndoors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance,\nrushes outside.\n\n                      EMT\n             What the fuck?!\n\nEXT. LAKE - DAY\n\nThomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over\ncurbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the\nlake!\n\nThomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far\nbehind.\n\nINSIDE THE AMBULANCE\n\nKimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a\nfinal gasp of air --\n\nON THE LAKE'S EDGE\n\nThomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle\ndescends below the surface -- and he dives in!\n\nUNDERWATER\n\nThomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets\nto the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his\nbaton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!\n\nHe tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of\nthe twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...\n\nAnd as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\nBLACKNESS.\n\n                      DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)\n             Ready and...CLEAR!\n\nThe SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life.\n\nKIMBERLY'S POV\n\nLooking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's\nface and a partial nametage reading \"Kalarjian\".\n\nIt would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --\n\nAn EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same\nPOV as the premonition.\n\n                      NURSE\n             She's back!\n\n                          DR. KALARJIAN\n                 Five CC's of narcodon. I want her\n                 stabilized and prepped for ICU.\n\nKimberly turns her head to see\n\nTHOMAS\n\nUnconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking\nwet). Thomas doesn't respond.\n\nAn INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes\nhis head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.\n\nFinally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS\nUPRIGHT.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Kimberly?!\n\nHe turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved,\nhe takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the\nplatform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.\n\n                      KIMBERLY\n                    (whispering)\n             Welcome back. We did it.           For\n             real.\n\n                           THOMAS\n                 I know.   I can feel it too.\n\nOutside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood\ninto the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an\nethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.\n\nThey exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic\nhospital.\n\nSLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. PARK - DAY\n\nWe are at a summer barbecue. Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et.\nEveryone's happy.\n\nTITLE CARD: FIVE MONTHS LATER\n\nANGLE ON\n\nShish -Kabob entering a mouth.\n\nREVEAL\n\nKimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the\nmetal skewer from her mouth.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              My God, this is delicious. I can't\n              believe I used to be a vegan.\n\nThomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer\nis deep in his mouth --\n\nA running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm.\nThomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his\nmouth around the shish-kabob.\n\n                       MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)\n              So what's the deal, Thomas? Three\n              months and you still haven't asked\n              my daughter out on a date.\n\nKimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.\n\n                       THOMAS\n              What's wrong with a platonic\n              relationship?\n\n                       MR. GIBBONS\n              Platonic my ass. That's for ugly\n              women.\n\n                       KIMBERLY\n              For God's sake, leave him alone,\n              Dad.\n\n                       THOMAS\n                     (smiling)\n              Yeah, don't make me cite you for\n              harassment.\n\n                       MR. GIBBONS\n              Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.\n                     (looking around, lowering\n                          voice)\n              Besides, if you can beat Death,\n\n             what's he got to worry about me\n             for?\n\nMr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,\nMRS. GIBBONS, joins.\n\n                      MR. GIBBONS\n             You know, you still never explained\n             to us how you did it.\n\nIt seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.\n\n                      THOMAS\n             Well, technically when we died, we\n             gave Death what it wanted. And by\n             the time we were revived, it had\n             already moved on to graver\n             pastures.\n\nMrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She\nchanges the conversation.\n\n                      MRS.
