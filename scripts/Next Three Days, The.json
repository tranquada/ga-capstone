The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the\r\n      stolen license plate.\r\n\r\n      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat\r\n      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he\r\n      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens\r\n      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads\r\n      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to\r\n      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do\r\n      this.\r\n\r\n      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs\r\n      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.\r\n\r\n      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out\r\n      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and\r\n      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.\r\n\r\n<b>                             ELAINE\r\n</b>                 What are you doing?!

He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside\r\n      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait\r\n      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.\r\n\r\n      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!\r\n\r\n<b>201   EXT.

Collero grabs the other side and\r\n       helps him lift.\r\n\r\n       They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along\r\n       the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.\r\n\r\n<b>                                DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                    You really thought you were going to\r\n                    find it?\r\n\r\n       Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the\r\n       hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>                                                                 116.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>345   CONTINUED:                                                        345\r\n</b>\r\n<b>      CLOSE ON INSIDE LIP OF STORM DRAIN\r\n</b>\r\n      Just before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON,              \r\n      squeezed between the grate and the wall.                                 \r\n\r\n<b>346   EXT.

Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.\r\n\r\n      She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past\r\n      him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara\r\n      lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face\r\n      to face with her sleeping son.\r\n\r\n      Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first\r\n      time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her\r\n      wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.\r\n\r\n<b>348   INT.

John sits on the other bed.\r\n      He picks up the TV remote and flips through Spanish language\r\n      stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right\r\n      now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.\r\n\r\n<b>350   INT.
