And \n\t\t\tit's not because you're unattainable.  \n\t\t\tI love you.  Very simple, very truly.  \n\t\t\tYou're the epitome of every attribute \n\t\t\tand quality I've ever looked for in \n\t\t\tanother person.  I know you think of \n\t\t\tme as just a friend and crossing that \n\t\t\tline is the furthest thing from an \n\t\t\toption you'd ever consider.  But I \n\t\t\tcan't do this any longer.

All I ask is that you \n\t\t\tnot suppress that - at least for ten \n\t\t\tminutes - and try to dwell in it \n\t\t\tbefore you dismiss it.  \n\t\t\tThere isn't another soul on this \n\t\t\tfucking planet who's ever made me the \n\t\t\tperson I am when I'm with you, and I \n\t\t\twould risk this friendship for the \n\t\t\tchance to take it to the next plateau.  \n\t\t\tBecause it's there between you and me.  \n\t\t\tYou can't deny that.  And even if we \n\t\t\tnever speak again after tonight, \n\t\t\tplease know that I'm forever changed \n\t\t\tbecause of you and what you've meant \n\t\t\tto me, which - while I do appreciate \n\t\t\tit - I'd never need a painting of \n\t\t\tbirds bought at a diner to remind me \n\t\t\tof.\n\n\tHolden stares at Alyssa.

And to \n\t\t\tcut oneself off from finding that \n\t\t\tperson - to immediately half your \n\t\t\toptions by eliminating the possibility \n\t\t\tof finding that one person within your \n\t\t\town gender... that just seemed stupid.  \n\t\t\tSo I didn't.  And by leaving my \n\t\t\toptions open, I was branded 'gay', \n\t\t\twhich to me was no big deal - labels \n\t\t\tare labels, you know?  They define \n\t\t\twhat you do, not who you are, I guess. \n\t\t\tBut \t\tthen you come along.

Then she puts \n\tup her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the \n\tpicture.  Alyssa gave him.  \n\tIt hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to \n\ther and shakes his head 'no'.\n\n\t2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky \n\tplays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL \n\t'96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things \n\ton the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and \n\tover.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.  \n\tAlyssa sticks her tongue at him.\n\n\t3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon \n\toff the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's \n\treading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick \n\tporno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the \n\told Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, \n\tputting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The \n\told Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the \n\ttape herself,\n\n\t4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the \n\tpark, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's \n\ttalking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She \n\tbegins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.  \n\tHe pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's \n\tflushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the \n\tVideo store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.\n\n\t5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the \n\twaving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden \n\tagain, this time with the painting hung completely upside \n\tdown.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.\n\n\t6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There \n\tare penciled pages on it with a note that says \"Hanging \n\tout with Alyssa today.  Holden\".  Banky crumples it up \n\tand throws it across the room.\n\n\t7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then \n\tthat way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.  \n\tShe settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile \n\tcrawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull \n\tback to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, \n\teating her out (no, we don't see anything!).\n\n\n\n<b>\tINT OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\n\tHolden draws.

He \n\tpoints to it and gives a thumbs up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOC FAN\n</b>\t\t\tProbably shouldn't have killed off \n\t\t\tChronic.\n\n\tBanky smiles to OC.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBANKY\n</b>\t\t\tGuess not.  Some doors just shouldn't \n\t\t\tbe opened.\n\n\tBanky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden \n\tand points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, \n\tand then looks back at Banky and nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOC FAN\n</b>\t\t\tYou don't need that guy, anyway.  You \n\t\t\tdo great stuff without him.\n\n\tBanky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his \n\tpointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared \n\tmoment' gesture.\n\n\tHolden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if \n\tto say 'hopefully'.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOC FAN\n</b>\t\t\tYou were just carrying that guy, \n\t\t\tanyway.\n\n\tBanky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers \n\this own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBANKY\n</b>\t\t\t\t(to fan, still looking OC)\n\t\t\tYou're so right.\n\n\tHolden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOC FAN\n</b>\t\t\tWell, keep up the good work, man.  \n\t\t\tLove them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See \n\t\t\tya.\n\n\tThe Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBXVKY\n</b>\t\t\tYeah.  Bye.\n\t\t\t\t(shakes it off)\n\t\t\tOkay.  Who's next?\n\n\tAlyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in \n\tfront of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off \n\tsignatures in the copies of her comic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\t\t(to OC departing fan)\n\t\t\tThanks for reading it.\n\n\tThe Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\t\tI'm going to get a soda.  You want \n\t\t\tanything?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tI'm fine, thanks,\n\n\tThe Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her \n\tbag.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\t\t(not rooking up)\n\t\t\tOkay, who's next!\n\n\tA comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a \n\tcomic book called 'Chasing Amy'.\n\n\tShe leafs through it, not looking up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tUm... This isn't one of mine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOC HOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tIt's mine.\n\n\tAlyssa looks up sharply.\n\n\tHolden stands before her, smiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tI saved you one.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tHi.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tHi.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tHow've you been?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tGood.  Really good.  Yourself?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tGood\n\t\t\t\t(beat; off her own comic)\n\t\t\tNew issue's selling like crazy, for \n\t\t\tsome reason.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tBecause it's so good.  I really liked \n\t\t\tit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tThank you.\n\t\t\t\t(off comic)\n\t\t\tI haven't even seen this yet.  Did it \n\t\t\tjust come out?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tA month ago.  I did a really small \n\t\t\trun.  Self-financed.  Only about five \n\t\t\thundred issues.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tWill I enjoy it?\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tYou might.  It's familiar subject \n\t\t\tmatter.\n\n\tAlyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tLooks Like a very personal story.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tI finally had something personal to \n\t\t\tsay.\n\n\tThey look at each other for a beat\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tI'm going to go.  I don't want to hold \n\t\t\tup the line.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tYeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I \n\t\t\tjust saw this nun in line call this \n\t\t\tsmall child a cunt-rag.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\t\tRead that, when you have a minute\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tI will.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tI'd like to hear your thoughts about \n\t\t\tit.  If you get a chance, give me a \n\t\t\tcall.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tOkay.\n\n\tThey look at each other for a beat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHOLDEN\n</b>\t\t\tNice seeing you again,\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tReally nice to see you too.\n\n\tHe walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves \n\tagain.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving \n\tthrough the thrall of fan-boys.\n\n\tThe Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's \n\tgaze.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\t\twho was that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\tHmm!  Oh.  Just some guy I knew.\n\n\tShe watches him go for another beat, then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tALYSSA\n</b>\t\t\t\t(to line)\n\t\t\tNext\n\t\t\t\t(to Woman)\n\t\t\tSo what do you want to do tonight?\n\n\tAnd as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEND\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Chasing Amy</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Kevin Smith\" title=\"Scripts by Kevin Smith\">Kevin Smith</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Chasing Amy Script.html#comments\" title=\"Chasing Amy comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:02:01.621185"}
