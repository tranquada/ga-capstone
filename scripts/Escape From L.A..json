Then he leans over to...\n               \n               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it\n               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues\n               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom\n               into the first glass.\n               \n               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and\n               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,\n               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart\n               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the\n               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third\n               glass.\n               \n               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood\n               is milky-green.

The crowd continues\n               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats\n               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from\n               one end.\n               \n               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,\n               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light\n               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.\n               \n               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes\n               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red\n               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then\n               gulps it down.\n               \n               The crowd explodes.

It\n               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally\n               stopping on the fat man.\n               \n               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at\n               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.\n               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws\n               his hand.\n               \n               The crowd reacts, boos, as...\n               \n               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And\n               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and\n               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops\n               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.\n               \n               The two men stand from the table.

The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed\n               downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.\n               \n               KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the\n               currents.

As the rear\n               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps\n               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up\n               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the\n               sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.\n               \n               A bleeping sound.

Next to the cross on stage, a\n               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.\n               \n               Plissken reacts.\n               \n               SPINAL\n               Let's take him.\n               \n               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others\n               quickly race down the hillside.

A fireball blows\n               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...\n               \n               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from\n               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his\n               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A\n               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are\n               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the\n               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts\n               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it\n               starts to rain again.\n               \n               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight\n               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and\n               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding\n               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying.

Gorgeous hookers stand under\n               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater.

And\n               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear\n               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the\n               prototype.

Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the\n               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan.

Cuervo Jones and Utopia.\n               \n               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either\n               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with\n               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and\n               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to\n               the chain.\n               \n               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire.

Plissken\n               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then\n               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The\n               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own\n               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,\n               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.\n               \n               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take\n               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden\n               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the\n               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.\n               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.\n               \n               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on\n               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips\n               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of\n               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the\n               saddle.\n               \n               THE HORSE\n               \n               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for\n               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them\n               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.\n               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the\n               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.\n               \n               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,\n               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it\n               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the\n               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.\n               \n               THE BIKE\n               \n               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,\n               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.\n               \n               THE HORSE\n               \n               Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.\n               \n               THE CADILLAC\n               \n               Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He\n               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up\n               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car\n               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...\n               \n               MESCALITOS\n               \n               Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps\n               moving toward the Cadillac...\n               \n               SUDDENLY A HAND\n               \n               Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.\n               Plissken turns to snatch it back -\n               \n               WHEN CUERVO JONES\n               \n               Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.\n               \n               CUERVO JONES\n               Snake Plissken.\n               \n               They struggle.

Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at\n               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away\n               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's\n               submachine gun.\n               \n               Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.\n               \n               CUERVO JONES\n               Later, Snake.

The once\n               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.\n               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.\n               \n               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and\n               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together\n               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the\n               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.\n               \n               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is\n               anchored in the middle of the street.

A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.\n               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.\n               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around\n               50.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Hi, Snake.

They move back to the\n               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken\n               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place\n               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their\n               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               What are they?\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               They live here, used to be like us. But\n               after too many silicon implants, their\n               muscles turned to jelly. The only way they\n               survive is to have body parts transplanted\n               over and over again.\n               (whispers)\n               Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills\n               gets out alive.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               No screamin' shit.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Oh no, it's the Doctor.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Who?\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.\n               \n               THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS\n               \n               Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk\n               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in\n               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,\n               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work\n               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak\n               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.\n               \n               THE DOCTOR\n               \n               Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.\n               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before\n               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made\n               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.\n               \n               THE DOCTOR\n               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.\n               There will be no auction tonight. These\n               body parts will go to those who need them\n               the most.\n               \n               The crowd gumbles.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               \n               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.\n               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto\n               his tongue, closes his mouth.\n               \n               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward\n               Plissken.\n               \n               THE DOCTOR\n               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame\n               you only have one.\n               \n               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it\n               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face\n               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good\n               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.\n               \n               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!\n               \n               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He\n               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls\n               forward.\n               \n               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the\n               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!\n               \n               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other\n               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off\n               the step-ladder.\n               \n               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time\n               as the doctor hits the pavement.\n               \n               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor\n               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.\n               \n               Snake starts to run...\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Snake, help me.\n               \n               SNAKE\n               Why?\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               I don't know.\n               \n               Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima\n               follows him.\n               \n               Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees\n               Taslima following...\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Don't follow me.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               You need help.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Like hell I do.\n               \n               Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.\n               \n               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET\n               \n               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,\n               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone\n               street...\n               \n\n               EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT\n               \n               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives\n               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large\n               buildings.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Down this way.\n               \n               They disappear into the small alley.\n               \n\n               EXT.

They turn...\n               \n               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from\n               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...\n               \n               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Go!\n               \n               He follows Taslima through the window.\n               \n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT\n               \n               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the\n               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting\n               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -\n               \"CAA\" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are\n               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.\n               \n               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in\n               these buildings.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               The what?\n               \n               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands\n               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw\n               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.\n               \n               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two\n               men.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               (yelling)\n               Are you gonna stand there? Give me the\n               gun!\n               \n               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor\n               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts\n               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.\n               \n               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good\n               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...\n               \n\n               INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT\n               \n               They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               How do we get out of here?\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Sewers. Come on.\n               \n               She pushes open the door...\n               \n\n               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT\n               \n               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails\n               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.\n               \n               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Down there.\n               \n               Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by\n               Plissken...\n               \n\n               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT\n               \n               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the\n               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving\n               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain\n               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and\n               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients\n               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...\n               \n               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird\n               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It\n               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming\n               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping\n               back down the tunnel.\n               \n               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL\n               \n               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Snake - what is it?\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               How the hell am I supposed to know? This\n               is your damn city.\n               \n               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -\n               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing\n               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a\n               blasting, ringing sound. Music!\n               \n               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!\n               \n               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.\n               \n               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an\n               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music\n               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of\n               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in\n               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat\n               is hooked to his belt.\n               \n               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the\n               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He\n               holds the gun on them.\n               \n               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO\n               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off\n               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like\n               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               What're you doing in here?\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Looking to get out.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Which way?\n               \n               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.\n               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.\n               With it, he examines Plissken's face.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               You're Snake Plissken.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Yes. Isn't he cool?\n               \n               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.\n               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me\n               Pendejo Bob.\n               \n               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and\n               footfalls of the patients gets closer...\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd\n               better climb aboard.\n               \n               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo\n               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.\n               \n\n               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT\n               \n               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only\n               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               I use the eye and the music to scare em\n               off. They're so whacked out, man, it works\n               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right\n               off the edge there a few months ago.\n               \n               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the\n               passage.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               (she peers over the side)\n               How far down does it go?\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Don't know - never do hear em land.\n               Earthquake opened it up.\n               \n               The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...\n               \n               INSIDE THE TUNNEL\n               \n               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and\n               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up\n               ahead is a door marked: \"SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL\"\n               \n\n               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT\n               \n               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control\n               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges\n               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered\n               with dust and grime.\n               \n               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,\n               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open\n               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of\n               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade\n               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked\n               everywhere.\n               \n               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               I own this whole place. Used to work here\n               in the old days. I was right in this room\n               when the big one hit. What a mess. We were\n               waist high in shit.\n               (turns proudly to them)\n               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed\n               at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought\n               my whole family, my amigos, down here to\n               live with me.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Gun runners.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Hey, it's a living, baby.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat\n               to China, take an airplane to Brazil?\n               (looks at Taslima)\n               Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,\n               Snake. We got our problems, sure - but\n               this is paradise, man.\n               \n               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to\n               Plissken.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?\n               Explosives? I can get you a crate of\n               hellfire grenades, no problem - five\n               hours.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.\n               You have to go topside. Right up there.\n               \n               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the\n               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,\n               carrying crates of weapons.\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.\n               Just follow the signs. Get off at the\n               Lincoln Exit, turn left.\n               \n               Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the\n               ladder, followed by Taslima...\n               \n               PENDEJO BOB\n               Nice to meet you, Snake.

The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the\n               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in\n               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.\n               \n               Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I\n               don't think it's such a good idea.\n               \n               Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               The freeways are dangerous.\n               \n               He keeps walking.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Goodbye, Snake.\n               \n               Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as\n               close to 'thank you' as he gets.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               Sun's coming up in a few hours.\n               \n               She walks up to him.\n               \n               TASLIMA\n               UV's gonna be bad today.

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT\n               \n               As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and\n               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.\n               \n               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past\n               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...\n               \n               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old\n               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old\n               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a\n               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,\n               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats\n               stare at him through the windows.\n               \n               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken.

BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT\n               \n               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with\n               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken\n               is hurled in. The door slams shut.\n               \n               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man\n               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.\n               \n               DELGADO\n               You're mine now, Snake. All mine.\n               \n               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming\n               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his\n               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.\n               \n               PLISSKEN\n               Shit.\n               \n               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just\n               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...\n               \n               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.\n               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and\n               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-\n               CLANG!\n               \n               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself\n               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick\n               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the\n               machetes CLANKS to the floor...\n               \n               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...\n               \n               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...\n               \n               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at\n               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.\n               \n\n               EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT\n               \n               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top\n               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by\n               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on\n               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their\n               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.\n               \n               Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.\n               \n               TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL\n               \n               It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the\n               side...\n               \n               PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD\n               \n               Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire\n               dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.\n               \n               Beat. Beat.\n               \n               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the\n               ground, takes his rifle.\n               \n               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.\n               \n\n               EXT.

Portions of the gigantic sports\n               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour\n               into the entrances.\n               \n               The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance.

LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT\n               \n               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear\n               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,\n               opens it, steps out...\n               \n\n               INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT\n               \n               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy\n               hallway.\n               \n               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.\n               \n               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a\n               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is\n               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.\n               \n               He moves forward...\n               \n\n               INT.

A basketball game is underway.\n               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the\n               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams.

The\n               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above\n               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.\n               \n               There's blood everywhere on the floor.

Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other.
