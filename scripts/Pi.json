BASEMENT SHUL - NIGHT\n\n\tThe synagogue is a claustrophobic, fluorescent-lit room in \n\tgeneral disarray. Two rows of imitation-wooden pews face a \n\tmakeshift altar and Ark.

SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER \n\tSol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOL \n\t\tListen to me. The Ancient \n\t\tJapanese considered the Go \n\t\tboard to be a microcosm of \n\t\tthe universe. Although when \n\t\tit is empty it appears to be \n\t\tsimple and ordered, in fact, \n\t\tthe possibilities of game play \n\t\tare endless. They say that no \n\t\ttwo Go games have ever been \n\t\talike. Just like snowflakes. \n\t\tSo, the Go board actually \n\t\trepresents an extremely complex \n\t\tand chaotic universe. That is \n\t\tthe truth of our world, Max. \n\t\tIt can't be easily summed up \n\t\twith math. There is no simple \n\t\tpattern.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tBut as a Go game \n\t\tprogresses, the possibilities \n\t\tbecome smaller and smaller. \n\t\tThe board does take on order. \n\t\tSoon, all moves are \n\t\tpredictable.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOL\n\t\tSo?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAX\n\t\tSo, maybe, even though we're not \n\t\tsophisticated enough to be aware \n\t\tof it, there is an underlying \n\t\torder...a pattern, beneath every \n\t\tGo game. Maybe that pattern is \n\t\tlike the pattern in the market, \n\t\tin the Torah. The two sixteen \n\t\tnumber.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOL \n\t\tThat is insanity, Max.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tOr maybe it's genius. I \n\t\thave to get that number.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOL \n\t\tHold on, you have to slow \n\t\tdown. You're losing it, you\n\t\thave to take a breath. Listen \n\t\tto yourself. You're connecting \n\t\ta computer bug I had, a \n\t\tcomputer bug you might have \n\t\thad, and some religious \n\t\thogwash. If you want to find \n\t\tthe number two sixteen in the \n\t\tworld, you'll be able to pull \n\t\tit out of anywhere. Two \n\t\thundred and sixteen steps \n\t\tfrom your street comer to \n\t\tyour front door. Two hundred \n\t\tand sixteen seconds you spend \n\t\triding on the elevator. When \n\t\tyour mind becomes obsessed \n\t\twith anything, it will filter \n\t\teverything else out and find \n\t\texamples of that thing \n\t\teverywhere. Three hundred and \n\t\ttwenty, four hundred and \n\t\tfifty, twenty-three. \n\t\tWhatever! You've chosen two \n\t\tsixteen and you'll find it \n\t\teverywhere in nature. But \n\t\tMax, as soon as you discard \n\t\tscientific rigor, you are no \n\t\tlonger a mathematician. You \n\t\tbecome a numerologist.

No math.\n\n\tMax looks at his bands.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOL \n\t\tJust try it. In a week \n\t\tyou'll laugh about this. \n\t\tC'mon, Max. Think about it!\n\t\n\tMax gives a half nod.\n\n\tEXT.

It is the most \n\t\tprevalent plant in all of \n\t\tKenya because it has managed \n\t\tto secure its niche by \n\t\tdefeating its major predator, \n\t\tthe giraffe. To accomplish \n\t\tthis, the tree has made a contract \n\t\twith a highly specialized red ant. \n\t\tThe tree has evolved giant spores which \n\t\tact as housing for the ants \n\t\tIn return for shelter, the \n\t\tants supply defense. When a \n\t\tgiraffe starts to eat the \n\t\ttree's leaves, the shaking \n\t\tbranch acts like an alarm. The \n\t\tants charge out and secrete an \n\t\tacid onto the giraffe's \n\t\ttongue. The giraffe learns its \n\t\tlesson and never returns. \n\t\tWithout each other, the tree \n\t\twould be picked dry and the \n\t\tants would have no shade from \n\t\tthe brutal African sun Both \n\t\twould die.

Farrouhk is a little guy with a \n\tbig sadistic smile.\n\n\tHe grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His \n\tfist butts up against Max's chin.\n\n\t\t\tFARROUHK \n\t\tThere you go, dork. \n\t\tBeen thinking about my \n\t\tgirlfriend.

Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be \n\tgives Max a small slap on the butt.\n\n\tINSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door.\n\n\tAt his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He \n\tpulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly.\n\n\tNext door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking.\n\n\t\t\t\tFARROUHK (O.S.) \n\t\tDamn dork.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tDEVI (O.S.) \n\t\tHe's just a bit unique.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFARROUHK(0.S.) \n\t\tUnique?! Unique?! He's a dork!\n\t\n\tThen, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew \n\tcharacters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several \n\tstrings of code lightning fast.\n\n\tThe Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical \n\tcounterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few \n\ttimes\u0097impressed.\n\n\tMax nods. Then there's a knock at the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\t\t(To himself) \n\t\tOkay.\n\t\n\tMax peeks through the peephole. Two well-dressed large men, \n\tBRAD and ABE THE BABE, wait for the signal.

I'm \n\t\tgoing to dissect the market.\n\n\tMax carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner Euclid. \n\tHe welds it into Euclid's waiting wires.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tHappy birthday, Euclid.\n\t\n\tThen he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden \n\twave of fear stops him.\n\n\tHe gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops \n\teight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda \n\tand places it on the counter.\n\n\tMax can hear Devi and Farrouhk starting to make love.

They're having \n\tfun.\n\n\tMax almost throws up.\n\n\tTHE BATHROOM\n\n\tMax dry heaves in the sink.

He \n\tloads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of \n\tpain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires \n\tit into his arm. Then he fires another and another.\n\n\tFrustrated he collapses into the mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tStop, please, stop.\n\t\n\tSlightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart. \n\tHe sees something.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tWhat the?\n\t\n\tSo he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.\n\n\tMeanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their \n\tscreams carry into Max's head.\n\n\tMax finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side\n\tof his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He \n\texamines it in the mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tWhat is it!? What is it!?\n\t\n\tThen his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It\n\tsounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max\n\tcan barely stand it.\n\tA jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he \n\tvomits blood into the sink.\n\tHe starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs\n\this head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!\n\n\tHis neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted \n\tand agonizing.\n\n\tThe mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He \n\treloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, \n\twhere the pain is coming from.\n\n\tMax collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare \n\tbulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.\n\n\tSuddenly the pain is gone.\n\n\tThen he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He \n\tgets to his feet and head's into Euclid.\n\n\tThe main monitor is screaming with numbers.

He drops Sol's \n\tnote.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX\n\t\tStop it, please!\n\n\tHe dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand.\n\n\tMax stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. \n\tHe looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He \n\tthrows the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to \n\tearth in SLOW MOTION.\n\n\tThe room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him \n\tto the ground and he bashes his head against the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\t\t(Courageously) \n\t\tNo. No. I'm ready. I'm \n\t\tready! Show me!\n\n\tMax recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The \n\tpain rips apart his voice.\n\n\tMax's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks \n\tEuclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his \n\tvoice.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tThree, seven, two...\n\t\n\tHe smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool \n\tthrough the mainframe.\n\n\tThen he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard \n\tcovering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the \n\tentire window wide open.\n\n\tSunlight floods the room and throws Max into the \n\tBLINDING WHITE VOID \n\twhere Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. \n\tEverything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases \n\tfrom his brow and his shoulders sag.\n\n\tMax continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender \n\tand peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his \n\tvoice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close.\n\n\tThen he hears Devi.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI (O.S.) \n\t\tMax. Max! Are you \n\t\tokay!? Oh my God, Max!\n\n\tHer voice reaches into the void.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI (O.S) \n\t\tMax! Breathe, Max. Breathe!\n\t\n\tMax looks toward her voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI (O.S.) \n\t\tYes, Max. Listen to me...\n\t\n\tWe cut back to \n\t...THE MAIN ROOM \n\twhere Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he \n\tcontinues to recite the number.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI \n\t\tBreathe, Max! Breathe. \n\t\tFocus.\n\n\tMax turns away from Devi and we return to the \n\tBLINDING WHITE VOID \n\twhere Max continues to recite the number.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI (O.S.) \n\t\tNo, Max. No. \n\t\tStay with me Max. Stay with \n\t\tme. \n\t\n\tAnd then we cut back to \n\tTHE MAIN ROOM \n\twhere Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her \n\thand. We return to \n\tTHE BLINDING WHITE VOID \n\twhere Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his \n\tfear filled eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tWhere am I? What is \n\t\tthis? This is wrong, Sol. \n\t\tSol!\n\t\n\tMax lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match \n\tcut back to \n\tTHE MAIN ROOM\n\n\twhere Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as\n\the collapses into her arms, sobbing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tSol! You were right Sol! \n\t\tHe was right.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI \n\t\tThat's right Max. That's \n\t\tRight. Breathe. Breathe.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAX \n\t\tHe was right. I want to \n\t\tbreathe. Breathe.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEVI \n\t\tYes, breathe, Max. \n\t\tBreathe...\n\n\tMax sobs. He holds onto her for dear life\n\n\tAnd then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is \n\tholding onto himself.\n\n\tThen Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the \n\tnumber. He collects himself and catches his breath.\n\n\tINT. MAX'S BATHROOM \u0096 DAY\n\n\tMax looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.\n\n\tNext, he prepares something in the sink.\n\n\tWe hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at \n\thimself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.\n\n\tHe takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max \n\tlifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit \n\tagainst the math section of his scalp.\n\n\tHe applies pressure and drills into his brain.\n\n\tMax collapses as we quickly \n\tCUT TO\n\n\tEXT. CITY PLAYGROUND - DAY\n\n\tTIGHT ON\n\ta tree branch gently blowing in the wind.\n\n\tMax watches it with peaceful, understanding eyes. He wears a \n\that on his head.\n\n\tHe listens to the wind in the trees.\n\n\tJust then, Jenna surprises him with her Fisher Price \n\tcalculator on hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEHNA \n\t\tMax, Max!\n\t\n\tMax smiles at Jenna. He's glad to see her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNA \n\t\tCan we do one, Max, can \n\t\twe?\n\n\tMax shrugs, not able to say no.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNA \n\t\tHow about two hundred \n\t\tand fifty-five times a \n\t\thundred and eighty-three.\n\t\n\tJenna types m the number.\n\n\tMax is about to say \"no\" to Jenna, but then be decides to give \n\tit a shot.\n\n\tMax thinks, he really thinks.\n\n\tJenna presses the EQUALS button.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNA \n\t\tI got it!
