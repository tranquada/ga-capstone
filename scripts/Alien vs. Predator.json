Presents\n\n<b>ALIENS\n</b>\nVs.\n\n<b>PREDATOR\n</b>\nScreenplay by Peter Briggs\n\n<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE\n</b>\nWe OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite \ndepths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these \nspecks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and \nracing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick \nglimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large \nbrownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere.  \nIt seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial.\n\n<b>EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY\n</b>\nThe planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch \nthe object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last \nburning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A \nBOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back \ninto an eerie silence.\n\n<b>EXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY\n</b>\nWe're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind \nwhips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About \nseventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a \ncave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a \nmechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE \nhumanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet \ntall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on \npermanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of \naborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; \n'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>\nFrom their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.  \nThe entrance registers as a black gaping void.\n\n<b>INT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL\n</b>\nThe five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's \nbanshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling \nat the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus.  \nHe removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a \ndeep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his \nwide forehead, marking him \ndifferent to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles \nhas been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of \nthe hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the \ntunnel.\n\nSeveral feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured \nbiomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He \nhurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who \nhas found something.\n\nThe other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered \non the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented \ntail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform.  \nBROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling \nspears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma \ncannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' \nhelmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances.  \nOne helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>\nHe switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra-\nviolet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing.\n\nHe's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the \nskeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical \ngrowth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight \nthrough the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A \ngargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS \nspinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The \nband of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they \nthemselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is \nswift and terrifying, a blur of motion.\n\nSteel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive \nwith the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned \nagainst the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away \nhis face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, \nextended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping \nthe 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc \nthat terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two \nare in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across \nthe PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to \nit, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into \nthe PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS \nPIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. \n\nIt all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no \nquestion as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea \nof biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his \ncompanions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK \nsteps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first \nPREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other.  \nWhat he finds causes him to react with\npity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles \nclicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the \nailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to \nhim.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife \nquickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick \nseasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen \nhunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished,\n\nBROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark \nshape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR \nshuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more \nthan a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap \naboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men \nreturning from combat.\n\nOne more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a \nsequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is \ndisplayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED \nBEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes \nsmoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting.\n\n<b>EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY\n</b>\nA white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the \nPREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly \naway, disappearing into the clouds.\n\n<b>EXT.  SPACE\n</b>\nA large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the \nPREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. \n\n\n<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY\n</b>\nAn airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the \nMothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut \ntakes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly \nlook up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious \nmixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script \nruns around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed \ninto it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN \nTUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. \n\n<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY\n</b>\nThe gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship.  \nBROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a \ncylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which \nconstantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over \nthe protective railing. \n\nWHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the \nALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is \ntethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, \nit's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling.  \nA SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly \ndefying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - \nsimilar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a \nview of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are \ncarefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a \nhatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening \nmechanical efficiency.\n\n<b>EXT.  SPACE\n</b>\nWe see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the \nplanet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are \nseeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt.\n\n<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY\n</b>\nThe blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to \nred, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter \nfrom a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a \nrepresentation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps \nthe EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor.  \nThe causes the QUEEN to go\nberserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's \nobviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen.  \nThe protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an \nenergy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops \nin, and is no more.\n\n<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS\n</b>\nAn orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows \ninto long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat \nslab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable \narsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across \nthe jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it \nfor a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before \nfinally getting to his feet. \n\n<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY\n</b>\nThe lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters.  He \nwatches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto \none of the EGGS, then runs his hand in sequence over the control board.  \nThe manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a \nwaiting pallet. \n\nBROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural \nCLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat.  The effect is not unlike that \nof a child firing an imaginary gun.  As if reading BROKEN TOOTH's \nthoughts, the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous \nHISS of contempt.\n\n<b>EXT.  SPACE\n</b>\nIn CENTER FRAME, the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous \nclouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view, \nsunlight glinting from it's surface.  It's a rectangular satellite-\nconstruction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a \nlatticework of steel tubing.  We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.  \nSubspace chatter.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY\n</b>\nImagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of \ntreetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet \nRyushi.\n\nNestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin \nCommunications Relay Station.  Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension \ncranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of \npreassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on \nplatforms, much like a truncated oil-rig.  A navigation beacon flashes \nintermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the \nview is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes \nhigh.  Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled \nhaulage vehicle.  A flock of bird-like creatures fly past.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nWe're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with \nclusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-\ntraffic control tower.  On the upper tier, a large circular holo-\ndisplay currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw.  Thin \ntrailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air \nconditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of \nthe people manning the consoled here.  We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER \nand ROB PARSONS, two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank.  \nCASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset. \n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'.  I've \nalready got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix.  Hold on \nmy mark until I get back with some confirmation.  Rimward Traffic \nControl out.\n\nShe thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.\n\n<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)\n</b>How's it looking?\n\nPARSONS worriedly shakes his head.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Better tell the boss.\n\nPARSONS pulls out a coin.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Toss you for it.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE\n</b>\nHIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling \nacross her Oriental features.  Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-\nside as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to \nassess from where the next attack will come.  She doesn't have to wait \nlong; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking \nwithout hesitation.\n\nShe expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly.  A persistent TONE \nbegins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING.  She tries to ignore \nit, but her concentration is clearly broken.  A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears \nfrom out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest.  The blade \nplunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back.  She glances \ndown in annoyed disbelief.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Fuck!  Holo off.\n\nThe SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear.  She sheathes the \nsword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to \nher desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud.  The \nRINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel \nreplaced with a black girl's face.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Noguchi.\n\nCASSIE  (O.S., onscreen)\nSomething just came up on Deep Space Tracking.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>What kind of 'something'?\n\nCASSIE   (O.S., onscreen)\nEasier if you come down and look.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>I'm on my way.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY\n</b>\nAn eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, \nclimbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty \nmain-street.  A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds \nindigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's \napproach.  The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt, \nwhile somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS.  \n\nDON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted \nfive feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He \nadjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the \nstreet towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in \nthe gentle breeze.  A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open \nbefore him. \n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nKAMEN steps into the command center, nodding familiarly to the DUTY \nPERSONNEL.  A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN, wagging it's \ntail. Her name is BREWSTER.  She's the base mascot.  KAMEN reaches down \nand ruffles it's fur.  He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier, \npulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE, an Italian systems-\nmechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console.\n\n<b>URIOSTE\n</b>You didn't wipe your feet coming in.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Well, it's okay.  You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out.\n\nPARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Hey, buenos dias, cowboy.  When d'you blow in?\n\nKAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Just got back.  Missed anything?\n\nURIOSTE   (snorts)\nYeah.  We're almost out of beer.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste. She's still pissed that \nNoguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip.\n\nKAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Wasn't my trip, I just did the driving. 'Sides, freezing my butt off \nout in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of \na good time, either.\n\nHe sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Where'd you leave them?\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making \ntheir own way back tomorrow.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Shit.  When?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story \non 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.\n\nKAMEN looks ill.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>You win some, you loose some.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything \nelse you wanna ruin my day with?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>No, but I got something that might interest you.\n\nHIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>What've you got?\n\nKAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They \nturn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of \nthe neighboring solar system.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen \ntwenty-four local time.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just \nto make sure.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.\n\nThe simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading \ntowards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations \naccompany them.\n\n<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)\n</b>Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a \ndeep-space drive.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>That's what we thought.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Done it already.  Nothing matches.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>And if you thought that was interesting, watch this...\n\nHIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Jesus.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're \nlooking at.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Tactical nukes, maybe?\n\nEverybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's \nobviously not an appealing thought.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Where're they headed?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's \npossible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.\n\nThere's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant \nglances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed \nback to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp \nBase, too.\n\nPARSONS nods, suddenly serious.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nDown here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in \ngnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana \nbayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for \ncover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, \na loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped \nhover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME \nsuspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a \nswirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES \nscatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called \"good 'ol \nboys\" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in \nthe other.\n\nYORK   (yelling)\nYou missed 'em, Ackland!\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the \nother side.\n\nYORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two \nbikes ROAR off in pursuit.\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nUp on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two \nblinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp.  It looks a little like \na Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details.  \nA hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a \nmug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber \nbullets into a belt-feed.  They \nwatch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING.  MINH scrambles out of \nthe way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him. \n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Crazy idiots.\n\nBEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you.  \nAckland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em.  Just a \ncouple of weekend warriors...\n\nShe peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the \nbelt feed.  On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-\nthe-shoulder guidance mechanism.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)\n</b>Nice howitzer you've got there.\n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Thanks.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?\n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the \nrhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock \nyou a month's pay for just mentioning it.\n\nHe peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.\n\n<b>MINH (CONT'D)\n</b>Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it, \nthough.\n\n<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE\n</b>\nAgainst a sea of stars, a small metal shape HURTLES towards us, \nfollowed moments later by it's identical twin.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nA strand of HIROKO's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain.  \nShe brushes up at the miserable weather.  She and KAMEN are standing on \none of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage \nvehicle we saw outside the base earlier.  Up on the side of the cab is \npainted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is \nthe legend 'BIG BERTHA'.  Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN \nDILLER, watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage \npoint of KAMEN's crawler parked in the swamp nearby.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the \npumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on \nthese new plastics.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module.  \nThat was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares \nin on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.\n\nKAMEN shrugs.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only \nchoice you've got.\n\nDILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>You offering?\n\nA buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF.  DILLER gets up to answer.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Nah.  Freeze my dick off.\n\nHIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>I don't know.  I think we'll have to run it on a rota; one month down, \none month operational.\n\nDILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Thanks.\n\nShe turns back to KAMEN.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nHIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern.  A sense of \nurgency buzzes around the room.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>When?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings \nare going to skim past the communications platform just a little too \nclose for comfort.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Can we move it to a different orbit in time?\n\nPARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Already working on it.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.\n\nShe meets KAMEN's eyes.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Looks like you were right.  Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles \nat us.\n\nKAMEN shakes his head.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother?  \nAll you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control \nnet.  That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists.\n\nPARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Okay, give me the numbers.\n\nShe flips a switch.  A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path \nsketched out in rectangular neon blocks.\n\n<b>EXT.

He pulls his bike to a stationary \nhover.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Shit!  What's that?\n\nACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the \nground.

LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK\n</b>\nThe earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the \nsurrounding brush still aflame.  A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to \nthe edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.  We \nHEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.  Before the SCORPION \ncan decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.  A large METAL CLAW comes \ndown, crushing it in an instant.  A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE \nheaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.  It \npauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves \npurposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.  A hatch on the \nunderside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.  After a \nmoment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.  In it's place \nis an ALIEN EGG.  The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long \nreeds.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\nHIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up \nto her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night \nimpenetrable.  Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the \ncommunications array strobe on-and-off.  Above the bar on the main \nstreet is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with \nthe words \"TORCHY'S\".  The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within \nbecome momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's \npressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN \nfollows them through.  He spots HIROKO and heads over.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.

'Sides, the room was getting too \ncrowded for me.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Not too much of the socializing type, then?\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.\n\nKAMEN LAUGHS.  HIROKO is straight-faced.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary \ninstallations.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Is that a fact.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.

No radiation... no movement... nothing.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!\n\nACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>What is it?\n\nACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the \nrhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>It's a rhino.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Is it dead?\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.

Fungus of some kind, maybe?\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.\n\nACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.\n\n<b>YORK (CONT'D)\n</b>Careful...\n\nThere's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree \nwith him.\n\nA heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a \nBANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Let's get back and call this in.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Wait a minute.\n\nYORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing \nfoliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to \npartially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over \nsomething at the bottom of the shallow pit.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>What is that... is that metal fragments?\n\nACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>This is very fucking weird.\n\nHe sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the \nbroken foliage.\n\n<b>ACKLAND (CONT'D)\n</b>It's like something came out of the crater and went that way...\n\nThere's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the \nsafety off his rifle.  ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.  They \nstep around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to...\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Another one?\n\nACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Yeah.  This's closed.\n\nThere's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in \nfour sections.  The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS \nnervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.  ACKLAND cranes his \nneck forward for a better look...\n\nThere's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.  A spindly shape with a long \nsegmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.  It's a \nFACEHUGGER.  ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.  His finger \ninvoluntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.  A volley \nof shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE \nBOOM, and we...\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.  SOMETHING is watching them \nfrom the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.  A PREDATOR.  We \nsee the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi-\ncolored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, \nbefore we... \n\n<b>CUT BACK TO\n</b>...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as \nhe races forward to help his friend.  The HUGGER's tail is already \naround ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.  YORK \npulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an \ninstant.  What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's \nface, and the questing tendril on\nthe HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips.  \nIn a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's \ngrasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING \nSOUND.  YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few \nfeet away.  He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving \naltogether.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.\n\nThe FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as \nYORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we...\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging \nACKLAND's body away from the crater.  It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, \ngiving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around \nthe HUGGER and into ACKLAND.\n\nYORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue \ntrousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling \nhim through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.  There's movement on \nthe ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to \nanother FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.  The HUGGER's \nfingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the \nmovement akin to somebody drumming their\nfingers on a table-top.\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT\n</b>\nAs YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND \nfrom the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.  YORK \nclutches his rifle and stares upward.  There seems to be a VAGUE \nSHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.  Although it might be a trick \nof the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.  YORK guns the bike \nto life and ROARS off above the swamp.\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>We're looking at the site in colours:  the cold blue of empty ALIEN \nEGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the \nFACEHUGGER parasites.\n\nA group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their \ncamouflage cloaks deactivated.  The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to \nthe exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE \ncurled up there.  Most of it has been madly mutilated by something \nerupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the \nswamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a \nband sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing \ndifferent levels of SOUND STATIC.  This abruptly stops as the \noscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.  The PREDATOR is \npicking up radio\nwaves.  A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted.\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn \nagainst intruding animals.  The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent, \nbleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.  She's suddenly wide awake \nwhen she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red \nstrobe.  It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of \nsilt.  YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten \nthe straps holding ACKLAND's body.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>Jesus Christ!  What happened?\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Give me a hand with Ack.\n\nShe races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>How bad is... oh my God.\n\nAs ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a \nFACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed. \n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>What is that?\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Don't... uuh... don't know.  Help me... uuh... help me get him inside.  \nShit!\n\nYORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.  He slumps \nslowly to the floor.\n\nBEAUVAIS   (yelling)\nMinh!  Minh, get out here!\n\n<b>INT.  TENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nA portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish \nlight over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.  MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it \nin horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his \nthigh.  He winces. \n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>Have you tried prising it off?\n\nYORK shakes his head.\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base.\n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Forget it.

We're gonna have to get it off.\n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Oh man...\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>Get real, Beauvais!  That thing might chew his fucking face off for all \nbe know!\n\nThe motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' \nhead-jerk.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>Minh...\n\n<b>MINH\n</b>Yep...\n\nMINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on \nYORK, continuing.\n\n<b>BEAUVAIS\n</b>How do you know it's not already?\n\n<b>YORK\n</b>I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look...\n\n<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nMINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of \nthe camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He \nstudies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He \nshakes his head in \ndisgust.\n\nMINH   (muttering)\nTake a goddamn wrench to those things...\n\nHe thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, \nand the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the \nweapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a \ntarget.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing \ntrigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it...\n\nThe gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking \nsomething automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off \nthree shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from \nMINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a \nmass of luminous green liquid and motion.\n\nMINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck)\nGod.\n\nMINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a \nSPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in \nan instant.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION. \n</b>Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the \nPREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH.\n\nA BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, \nspraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of \npained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing \nacross and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to \ntake the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger \nguard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an \nunseen shape races at her.  There's a loud\n\nSWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air.  \nIt SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and \nimpaling her against a tree.\n\nYORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later \nher struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken \nmarionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS \ndisappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch \ntrickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it \nzeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon \nfollowing suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the \nplasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg.\n\nHis options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for \nthat and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips \nit.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded \nPREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns \nthe key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS \nan ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE \nENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade \nslices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta-\nwings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into \nthe swamp.\n\nYORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the \nrear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR \nhanding from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their \ncamouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK \njams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more \ncannon-blasts blossom around him.\n\nThe group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the \narea. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses \nto the tent and opens the entry flap.\n\n<b>INT.

It's MINH's \n'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.  She crouches down \nand rubs her fingers through it.  Blood.  KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S.\n\n<b>KAMEN   (O.S.)\n</b>I've found Ackland!\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Hold on...\n\nShe begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of \nrope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the \nface and knocking her off her feet.  HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and \nsurprise, then freezes at what she sees.\n\nTwo bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS \nand MINH.  Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.  KAMEN \nhears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.  He stops \nin his tracks.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Jesus palomino...\n\n<b>EXT.

Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO \nwatches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic \ntrolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late \nthirties.  As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO \nhas left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.  KAMEN runs after \nREVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Wait a minute, Doc...\n\nHe hands the bag over to REVNA.  She peers at the contents curiously.  \nThe FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled. \n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Is this it?\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Yeah.  Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.

(long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY\n</b>\nA CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a \nhand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained \nconsciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a \ncot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical \nequipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a \ncircular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting \nblades and surgical paraphernalia.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really.\n\nREVNA flicks off the probe.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Headache?  Dehydration?\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Forget that.

What am I doing back here?  Where's \nYork?\n\nHIROKO   (insistent)\nWhat's the last thing you can remember?\n\nACKLAND thinks hard.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's.\n\nHIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>A meteor?\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Yeah, it impacted really off.

She \nhands it to ACKLAND.  He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside \nwith morbid fascination.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Ring any bells?\n\nACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard \non his mind.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Not really, no.

If we were back on \nEarth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure.  \nThere's not much we can do out here.\n\nKAMEN stares hard at her.

RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nA metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.  DILLER leans \nagainst it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly \nblowing rings into the air.  BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to \nquietly SNARL.  DILLER glances down at her curiously.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>What's the matter, girl?  You smell something?\n\nNow the rhino are restless too.  CASSIE walks across the concrete \nroadway to join them.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Rhinos look a little antsy,\n\nBREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Yeah.  Never seem 'em act like this before.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter' \nstill.  Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of \nunrecognizability, eerily distorted.\n\nCASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Do you hear that?\n\nDILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a \nFAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Yeah...\n\nA hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as \nit hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, \nit clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through \nthe air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the \nramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>I don't believe it.\n\nDILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the \nmire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Wait a minute...\n\nSomething else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A \"something\" almost two \nmetres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike.  \nGrasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the \nPREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.\n\n<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)\n</b>Holy Mary...\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.\n</b>The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the \nweapon over in her hands.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY\n</b>\nREVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she \nGRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal.  \nThe stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of \nthe computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle \nTHROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably \non his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Oh.  Oh God...\n\nREVNA lowers her pen and looks across.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>What is it?\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Do you want a tablet?\n\nACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods.\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Uh-huh.\n\nREVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's \nbeginning to COUGH now.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine.\n\nACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging \nhis chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red \ntablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully \nand gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens \nand an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.\n\n<b>REVNA (CONT'D)\n</b>Better?\n\n<b>ACKLAND\n</b>Yeah...\n\nBefore he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin \nspray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her \ncheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to \nhyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the \nprocess.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.\n\n<b>REVNA\n</b>Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot...\n\nHer fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical \ninstruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a \nvial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto \nthe floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the \ninjector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND \nconvulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the \nceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again.\n\nWe hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in \nhorrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across \nthe floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body \nmoves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it.\n\nWHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, \nrevealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are \njust visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform \n- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of \nstill-underdeveloped arms.\n\nAround it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from \nACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance.  \nAfter a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a \ntable.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red \nstud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed.\n\nThe room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the \ncreature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She \ncautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of \nprobe-arms. \n\nThere's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery.  \nREVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's \narmed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER...\n\nThere's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the \nhunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL \nSHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We \nhear a SIZZLE like frying bacon...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR\n</b>\nHIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, \nCASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays \nunconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making \naccess difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open \nrevealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the \nbulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>What happened?\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.\n\nHIROKO   (astonished)\nYork...\n\nHIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from \nwithin the Infirmary distracts her.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>What's going on?\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds \nlike Ackland's going nuts.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Force the door.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Can't.  It's pressure sealed.\n\nGUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Here...\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Thanks.\n\nHe inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical \neffort showing on his face.  The door grinds open about eight inches... \n\nThe bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING \nvehemently.  Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull, \ndissolving everything it comes into contact with.  The small group \ngathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking \nHIROKO to the floor.  BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses \nas if to leap.\nDILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and \ntakes flight.  It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head \nback and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek.  \nThe ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared \nblood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring.  \nGUTTIEREZ bends down and\nhelps HIROKO to her feet.  Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in \nJAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Get after it, don't let it get away!\n\nDILLER stands there with the metal bar.  Does she think he's nuts?\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Go on!\n\nThis galvanises DILLER.  He races off in pursuit.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Jan, give me a hand over here.\n\nHIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door, but DILLER was right - it \nwon't budge.  HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around \nblindly.  She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides \nback.  CASSIE looks inside.\n\n<b>CASSIE\n</b>Oh my God...\n\nShe turns away and retches.  HIROKO steps through and goes pale.  There \nare blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop \nBREWSTER from getting in there.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nPARSONS' finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics \ndisplayed on a suspended glass screen.\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>What is that?\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating \nripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Where does that lead to?\n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed \nout into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-\nout.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>You've checked that end?\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Not yet, no.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Do it.  I don't want that thing on my installation.  I want it caught \nand destroyed.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is \nbasically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off \nexternal couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, \nwe've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That \nshould give us ample time to find it.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign \na release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it \non the board.\n\nCASSIE nods soberly.  HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are \ncarefully chosen.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>I don't care how you kill this thing, just be careful not to get in \nit's way when it bleeds.  You all saw what happened to Doc Revna.\n\nThere are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs.  \nDiller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down \nwith Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Okay.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in \nitself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a \nhefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.\n\nThis seems to appeal to those assembled there.  There's a palpable buzz \nin the air.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Alright, let's get to it.  New York rules apply.\n\n<b>INT.

They look like \nbushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em.  \nThey must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.

He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits \nuntil the door slides shut behind him.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>So, what do you think?\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>What do I think?

It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. \nBelow it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its \nsurface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on \neither side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume \nof steam JETS out of the valve.\n\n<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)\n</b>Give me a hand with this.\n\nGRUNTING, the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit.  \nMurky water sloshes around below.  URIOSTE pulls a second lever, and \nhidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly.\n\n<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)\n</b>Pass me over that tripod, will you?\n\nLeaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped \nwith a block-and-tackle arrangement.  A hook dangles below this, it's \nthick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and \nconnecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to \nthe wall.

A short-\nrange antennae, about seven feet wide.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)\n</b>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think \nwe're got it cornered...\n\n<b>EXT.

DE VRIES YELPS in surprise, and looses off \na spray of bullets.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nHIROKO looks up, startled by the sound of GUNFIRE.  She sees the \nrooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire.  BREWSTER's \ntethered nearby, BARKING furiously.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT\n</b>\nA think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in \nthe gloom of the Pump Shaft.  In front of her is a machine-part we saw \nher carry earlier.  With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her \nmouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of \nmachinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch \nthe walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge.\n\nThe REPORT of DE VRIES' weapon can be heard even down here, perhaps \nmore startling in the confined space.  URIOSTE jumps, dropping the \nflashlight into the water in the process.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM\n</b>\nDILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access \ntunnel leading outside.  URIOSTE's VOICE floats up out of the shaft. \n\nURIOSTE   (O.S., muffled)\nWhat was that?\n\nDILLER   (raising his voice)\nSomething outside...\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK\n</b>\nThe wind whips at GUTTIEREZ as he blinks away his shock.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Holy shit...\n\nDE VRIES keeps her torch beam on the moving shape.  It halts by the \nedge of the roof, and stares at them.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>Oh, nice going, man!  It was a lemur! A goddamn lemur!\n\nGUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life.\n\nHIROKO   (O.S., on headset)\nGuttierez, what the hell's going on up there?\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Uh... sorry about that, boss.  Everything's fine.  False alarm, that's \nall.\n\nDE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>Hey, look; let's forget it.  There's nothing up here.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing brightly.  Her VOICE replayed and \ndistorted.\n\n<b>PREDATOR   (O.S.)\n</b>Nothing up here.  Nothing up here.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT\n</b>\nURIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and \nwell out of reach.\n\nURIOSTE    (disgustedly)\nShit.\n\nDILLER   (O.S., muffled)\nWhat's the matter?\n\n<b>URIOSTE\n</b>I've dropped my torch into the water.

On the mechanism's side is a \nluminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He \npulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from \"8\" to \"9.5\" \nas the cable feeds out.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT\n</b>\nURIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls.  \nHer feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go.\n\n<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)\n</b>Whoa, whoa...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM\n</b>\nURIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit.\n\nURIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled)\nThat's enough.\n\nDILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE \nof the cable-feed stops immediately.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT\n</b>\nURIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers.  \nIt's... just... about... in... reach...\n\nSix slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp \nlike a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, \ntrailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM \nforms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps \nfirmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM\n</b>\nDILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the \nwinch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an \nangler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps \nfrom it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening \nrate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; \n\"11...11.5...12...12.5...13...\"  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular \nlegs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for \nthe winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the \nover-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the \nshaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the \ndeep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by \nthe colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy \npiece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear \nnoisily into the conduit.\n\n<b>DILLER\n</b>Annie!\n\nDILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.\n\n<b>DILLER (CONT'D)\n</b>Annie!\n\nHe feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness.\n\nWHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the \nALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft \nwalls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door.  \nHalf-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, \ngrasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the \nsafety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it \nback into the pit.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK\n</b>\nGUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>The hell was that?\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the \nplatform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people \nrunning towards the source of the shots...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM\n</b>\nDILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER \nALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the \nthreshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nIn a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow \ncatwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead.  \nDILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides \nwith him. \n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Kev, wha...?\n\nDILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about \nto say something, but never gets the chance.\n\nThere's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express \ntrain of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK\n</b>\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black \nSHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans...\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She \nviolently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that \nbarges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. \n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nPARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed \nto his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. \n\n<b>PARSONS\n</b>Oh my God...\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nWith superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, \nsplintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into \nTHOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's \nquesting fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the \nground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people \nit's impossible to get a clean \nshot...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Move!  Get out of the way!\n\nHIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her \nrifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger.  \nIt's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying.  \nCALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It \nstrikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's \nchest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that...\n\nThe ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is \ninches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth \nopen...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike...\n\nWHOOMPH.  Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk.  The \nALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS.  A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM \nappears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic \nfluid.  The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's \nubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant.  The STINGER \nmakes contact:  there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking \ndevice begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses \nof it's natural form.  Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's \nruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his \narm...\n\nFrom out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in \na compactor.  HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to \nthe door panel.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Get the door!\n\nKAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior \npressure bulkhead RUMBLE together.  A SECOND ALIEN appears from the \nshadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap, \nstruggling for purchase.  Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door \nmotors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid \nCLUNK.  MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side.\n\nNearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight \nand is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR.  At the last possible \nmoment HIROKO sees what he's about to do...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>No!\n\nReflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of \nshots.\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION. \n</b>The PREDATOR's speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white-\nhot bullets sear the night.\n\n<b>PREDATOR\n</b>No!\n\n<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  \n</b>SNAPPING IN for a closer look at her.\n\n<b>PREDATOR (CONT'D)\n</b>No!\n\nOne of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and \nwrenches it off.  HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination.  \nFrom the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK.  The \nPREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to \nfollow.  In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up, \nslicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head.  In a feat of \nstrength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the \nspear and hurls it over the catwalk railing...\n\nNot wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of \nsome twenty feet with astounding grace.  He grips a pipe running down \nthe side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's \nedge and finally disappears from view.  BREWSTER continues to BARK \nfrenetically. \n\nHIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED \nVOICE is coming from it.  She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit' \nswitch. \n\nHIROKO   (into headset)\nIt's alright, Rob...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nPARSONS listens to HIROKO, suddenly wide awake.

RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nTHOMAS is moving from DILLER to CALDWELL, checking them for signs of \nlife. HIROKO catches his eye.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Well?\n\nTHOMAS shakes his head.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES race across the \nplatform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish.  GUTTIEREZ \nbends down by DILLER's body.  THOMAS lays a hand on GUTTIEREZ' arm.\n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>Come on, man.  Leave it alone.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Oh, God.  Dear Lord Jesus...\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>This is like a bad dream, man.  A bad fucking dream.\n\nHIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision.  She speaks into her \nradio headset.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Rob?  I want you to evac everybody from the non-connective modules into \nadmin. That goes double for anybody...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nHIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speaker)\n...already out here.  We're going to lock every bulkhead and seal the \nbase.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nHIROKO turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured \nlights dotted around the platform start to blink on-and-off.  KAMEN \nCOUGHS a few more times.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Are you okay?\n\nKAMEN rubs his throat.  He nods.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>I'll survive.\n\nBREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>What's with the dog?\n\nGUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER.  Lowers his rifle to the ground and \nfumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Hey; c'mon now, girl.  It's alright.  Let's just get this knot \nundone...\n\nA spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ.  \nThe rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as \nan ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and \nglistening...\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Jan!\n\nBREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control.  When the ALIEN \nlashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can \ndo.  BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as \nshe's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>Get out of there, man!\n\nTHOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards \nGUTTIEREZ, with \nDE VRIES close behind... \n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>Catch this!\n\nFrom behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid \nlimbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle \nover the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it \nawkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Chew on this!\n\nDE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances \ndown at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots \nof them.\n\nKAMEN   (hollering)\nThey're all around, they're in the drainage system!\n\nDE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging \nALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Get your ass out of here, boss!\n\nALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the \nplatform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the \ngenetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid.  \nAll of them are living nightmares.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Oh my God...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS\n</b>\nCASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her \ntiny bathroom-cubicle.

As they race swiftly down \nthe street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A \nparticularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind \nthem.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the \noutside of a module towards them.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>De Vries!\n\nDE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid \nburst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death \nthroes. \n\nThe group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them \nis parked KAMEN's crawler.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)\n</b>Inside, inside!\n\nThey scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the \ndriver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth.  \nTHOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign.\n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>Yo' momma, boneface!\n\nDE VRIES   (to Guttierez)\nC'mon, man; punch this cow!\n\nGUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.

Inside it are rows \nof metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them.  \nBROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the \nmedical kit onto his back before getting to his feet.\n\nStanding around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have \ntheir camouflage cloaks activated.

RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nDespite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of \nPREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde. \n\nBROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away \nanother attacker.  Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the \nplatform.  One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering \nintermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct.  \nThe two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the \nPREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS\n</b>\nPumped up with adrenalin, KAMEN reaches an intersection and encounters \na harrowing tableau.  An ALIEN blocks his way on the other side of a \ncorridor bulkhead, holding a STRUGGLING MAN above the floor.  It's \npiston-like tongue shoots into the MAN's skull, spraying gore.\n\nThe ALIEN sees KAMEN, and it's mouth twists into a bloody SNARL.  Both \nKAMEN and the ALIEN lunge forward together, but KAMEN's got the edge by \na split-second.  He STRIKES a bright red switch and the overhead \npressure bulkhead SLAMS down and locks into place.  His breathing is \nheavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch...\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK\n</b>\nThe two ALIENS THOMAS killed must have been the scout party.

It falls from her \nhands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a \nsecond too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good.\n\n<b>THOMAS (CONT'D)\n</b>Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now!\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE\n</b>\nHIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box \non the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to \nslide closed behind the polycarbonate window.\n\nKERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes \nunder assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, \nHIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away.  \nShe watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge \noutside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously \nraining repeated blows on the window with it's tail.\n\nThe ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the \nonslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters \nsecure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It \nHISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented \ntail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining \nbalance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden \nfloorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an \nunstoppable killing machine...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Holo on!\n\nHer VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the \ncomputer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, \nforming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, \nconfused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, \nbewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them.\n\nGaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards \nthe PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this \nsudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO \nGRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength...\n\nShe's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does \nthe job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks \nthere, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat \nas the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged \nweapon...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS\n</b>\nHIROKO reels into the outside corridor.

She \nsights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical \nstorage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires...\n\nA molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity \ninto a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, \nremaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples \nacross the platform...\n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>Yes!\n\nTheir victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously \nforward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can \nclearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>Try again, man...\n\nThe headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct \nchannel. He YELLS into it...\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Matt!  Open these damn doors right now, I'll ream your ass so bad these \nthings out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison!

DE VRIES \n<b>SCREAMS...\n</b>\nThere's a blinding flash, and most of the ALIEN's head vaporises.  \nGUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted \nfire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN \nantagonists.  Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-\ntech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans' sears the air...\n\nGUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly \nopen. Just enough for them to get through.\n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Move!\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP\n</b>\nTHOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly \nfollowing.\n\nThe Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one \nwall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the \ncenter of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on \na hydraulic platform.  A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the \ndoorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms.  A blonde surfer-\ntype with long straggly\nhair rushes over to them.  This is MATT, their savior.\n\n<b>MATT\n</b>Close it up, close it up!\n\nGUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up.  \nIn the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle \ntooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents.  It's like a scene out of \nHell.\n\n<b>INT.

HIROKO hefts the heavy tool, swinging it down onto the \ndisappearing ALIEN's carapace with all her might...\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Bastard!\n\nThe blade bites deep, and yellow blood bursts from the threshing \nALIEN's wound.  Speckles of it dot KAMEN's leg, eating through the \nmaterial of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath.  He \nSCREAMS, a sound of pure intense pain...\n\nHIROKO hurls the axe aside.  She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole \nas the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit.  \nThere's a SPARKING, followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME.  CASSIE \nsteps through into the corridor, just as valves evenly-spaced along the \nlength of the tunnel open up, jetting white high-density foam under \nextreme pressure.  The hatch to the Command Center at the far end \nbegins to close...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Cassie...!\n\nCASSIE's head shoots around.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nYORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it \ninto the narrowing divide.

RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER\n</b>\nfrom CASSIE's P.O.V. we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him \nalong.

RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK\n</b>\nThe battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only \nthree of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK.\n\nA projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in \nflight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into \nthe wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors \nWHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body...\n<b> \n</b>The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too \nlong. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The \nshoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and \nCLATTERS to the floor.\n\nThe PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his \nwrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but \ngets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The \nPREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight \nthrough the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer \nin the process.\n\n<b>INT.

BROKEN TUSK takes \nflight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an \nALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with \nlightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures \nhurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of \nthe modules.

He GRUNTS as he pulls a \nvalve on the crawler's underside.\n\nAcross the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of \nthe GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on.\n\n<b>GREASE MONKEY\n</b>Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more...\n\nHe steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.\n\n<b>GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D)\n</b>Whoa...shit!\n\nThe man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the \nfloor.

THOMAS yells \ndown from the platform.\n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>They're comin' up through the pit!\n\nA box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the \nceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, \nmaking the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring \nabout the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, \nCRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens.\n\nAn ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the \nnearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it.\n\n<b>DE VRIES\n</b>Over there!\n\nOne of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine-\nblock suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release-\ncatch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains \nRATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look \nup, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into \nthe creature, flattening it instantly.\n\nUnseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the \nplatform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the \nface of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The \nLOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets \nTHOMAS' attention.\n\n<b>THOMAS\n</b>Mother-fucker!\n\nTHOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The \nALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering \nTHOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body \nand lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up.\n\nThe blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. \nTHOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH \nof the blade, a peculiar sound...\n\nThe acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.

Glued into the \ncurved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS.  \nOther ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are \ncomatose, twitching occasionally.

It \nmight be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell.\n\nHIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the \npower-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!

Nothing happens.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Come on...\n\nShe bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny \ngreen LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A \nmalfunction.\n\nCOMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers)\nAttention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate \naccess to  venturi ducts.\n\nThere's only one recourse left to her.

The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... \n\n...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery \ndome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates \nitself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself \nback toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO \nraises the power-tool,\nreflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP \nthrough the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's \nsurface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives \ninto the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt.\n\nBZZZZ!  It's out!

The ALIEN draws \nher nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture \nlines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts \nto flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass.\n\nHIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger.  \nRivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A \nhaze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, \ncoughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with \nall her might.\n\n<b>EXT.

HIROKO hauls herself from the \nshaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She \nthrows the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks \ndesperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment \noff.\n\nAs promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts \ntowards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the \nruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through \nthe smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws \nthe keys.\n\nSLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO \nscrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears \nacross to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines \nROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the \npowerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp.  \nLosing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck.\n\nHIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire \nover by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and-\norange smoke rising into the air.\n<b> \n</b>A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet \nanother ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the \nhoverbike, gaining balance in an instant.\n<b> \n</b>HIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see-\nsawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, \ncrawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both \nthrottles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a \nhalt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the \nsurrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls \nit back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the \nleading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising \ncreature, neatly decapitating it. \n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO \ndismounts and draws her pistol.

Ahead is the \nout-of-control blaze.  A tongue of flame licks out across the platform, \ndirectly in her path.\n\nHIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for \ncover behind the bike's windshield.  The ALIEN's head twists around, \nand they plunge into the inferno...\n\nWHOOMPH!  The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume \nof yellow flame.  HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the \nsteering bar hard to the right.  She leaps for safety as the burning \nbike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety-\nrail and plummets into the swamp.\n\n<b>EXT.

It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to \nraise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby \nnavigation tower... straight for her.\n\nHIROKO turns tail.

So do the ALIENS.\n\nShe cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the \nmain street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the \nother side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops \nthirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something \nred.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to \nthe building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch.  \nGlances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the \nprimer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and \nturns...\n\nShe's practically on top of the bolts.  The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING.  \nWith the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street \nwith a SCREECH of twisted metal.  One of the ALIENS is pulverized by \nthe falling debris, but the others survive.  All HIROKO's managed to do \nis buy herself some breathing space...\n\nShe races across the building's roof.  Reaches the other \nside...straight into a dead end.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying \nCLUNK.

It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with \nno ladders or any other way down.  She looks desperately around for \nanother avenue of escape.\n\nThe leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.  HIROKO \nswings her pistol over and fires.  It falls away...only to be replaced \nseconds later by two others.\n\nHer gun goes dry.  Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine.  \nShe slaps the spare in and continues firing.\n\n<b>INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT\n</b>\nBig Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees. \nGUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches. \n\n<b>GUTTIEREZ\n</b>Get down!\n\nDE VRIES hits the floor.  The thick boughs impact with the cab, \nSHATTERING the safety glass.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT\n</b>\nBANG!  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  CLICK.  HIROKO's gun's empty.  She reaches \nfor another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last \none.\n\nThe encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.  With no place to \ngo, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.  The lead \nALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.  It's almost on her.  HIROKO \n<b>CRIES OUT...\n</b>\nWHOOSH!  The ALIEN's face is severed in half.  A circular metal object \nblurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the \nhuman eye can follow.  A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO, \npushing her out of the way.  She hits the deck hard and gasps.  BROKEN \nTUSK is standing before her.  He skillfully catches the frisbee-like \n'smart weapon', then\nthrows it again.\n\nHIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the \nALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable \nfighting  technique.  Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by \nadvanced PREDATOR weaponry.  Acidic blood flows freely.  The skirmish \nis surprisingly brief.\n\nBROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.  BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung \nmetal rod from his shoulder.  Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming \na spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.  It takes a \nsecond for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.  Bewildered, she \naccepts it, pulling herself up.\n\nA bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of \ntheir attentions.  BROKEN TUSK regards her.  His mandibles CLICK-CLACK \nnervously... \n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Look.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry \ncoming to my rescue... they never looked like you.\n\nThe PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT\n</b>\nAnother gout of flame BELCHES out of the churning mass in the middle of \nthe station.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT\n</b>\nHIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands. \n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Broken.  Useless!\n\nShe throws it aside.  BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard.  \nAnother DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Jesus.  I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place.\n\nShe SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Come on, Butch.  Let's go.\n\nShe begins to walk away.  BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier, \npeering over the side...\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Hey!  I said come on!\n\nThe PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.  He gauges the distance below, \nthen throws himself off the platform's edge.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>What...?\n\nShe races across to the rail and gazes downward.\n\n<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.\n</b>The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see.  \nHIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Shit!\n\nShe crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT\n</b>\nHIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK \nhas paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform \npiers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is \nunderwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water.  \nThe thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from \nwithin.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there!\n\nNo joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Hey!\n\nBROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears \ninto the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last \nperson left alive here.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Goddammit!\n\nShe takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows...\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT\n</b>\nHIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers.  \nIt's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the \nmaintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. \n\nHIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly)\nWha...?\n\nBROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the \nmessage.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR\n</b>\nThey exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds \nherself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the \nwater behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of \nthem look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC \nHIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS \nPULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they \ntravel.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER\n</b>\nThey come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by \nan enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything.\n\nHIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast \nmechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around \nit. She seems to be asleep.\n\nBROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of \nforms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what \nhe's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's \nstomach blown open.\n\nHIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped \naround several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered \nhere-and-there.\n\nBROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic \nfresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The \nbellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the \nentrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of \nsecreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates \nit.\n\nThe SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN.  \nIt's breathing start to change, and it's head moves...\n\nBROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN \nsettles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes \nhis work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the \n'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He \nwithdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to \nwork...\n\nDOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in \nslime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her \neyes are wide as she turns...\n\nIt's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he \nspeaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering.\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>Hiroko...\n\nHIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE.\n\nUP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip \nof a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display \nilluminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the \nreadout begins to blink...\n\nBELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.\n\n<b>KAMEN (CONT'D)\n</b>They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I \ndon't...remember what happened next.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>What can I do?\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>I... I can't!\n\n<b>KAMEN\n</b>You have to...\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>No!\n\nBROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm.  \n<b>SCHNICK! \n</b>The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale \nface. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR\n</b>\nBROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a \nnearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to \nspring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting \nthrough the EGG and it's writhing contents.\n\nThe two of them reach the deep end and have to wade.  HIROKO pushes \nherself along the biomechanical outcropping.  Ahead of them is the \nPULSING SAC. Before they're even passed beneath it, they hear \nSOMETHING.  A SOUND like water-filled balloons hitting wet concrete.\n<b> \n</b>The SAC ruptures, spattering thick gloopy matter.  A form comprised of  \nslender limbs emerges from within.  An IMMATURE QUEEN ALIEN.  Though \njust-born, it's reflexes are razor-sharp.  It lashes out at HIROKO and \nBROKEN TUSK.  HIROKO ducks, and the QUEEN's claws embed themselves in \nBROKEN TUSK's shoulder, destroying his automatic cannon.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nA VAST EXPLOSION rips through the base, broiling clouds of flame \nrolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts. \n\n<b>INT.

RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR\n</b>\nThe adult QUEEN's SHRIEK echoes through the reservoir, accompanied by a \nball of fire that travels part of the way down.  The IMMATURE QUEEN \nturns her head in reply, answering with her own YOWL.\n\nBROKEN TUSK HISSES with hate, and brings his 'smart weapon' SLICING \ndown through her arm, severing it at the wrist.  HIROKO simultanesouly \nDRIVES her spear into the ALIEN's chest.  She grabs the injured \nPREDATOR and pulls him away from the thrashing creature.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Come on!  Come on!\n\n<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER\n</b>\nThe alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably \ncount down...\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe metal plug HIROKO blew during her earlier escape still lies to one \nside of the duct HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK crawl hastily out of.  \nFireballs are erupting all around now, making their situation \nprecarious. \n\n<b>EXT.

RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN\n</b><b> \n</b>HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet, with the PREDATOR close \nbehind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles \ndesigned to deflect downward exhaust gases.  HIROKO's feet CLATTER \nacross the metal...\n\nKER-SMASH!  The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her.  \nThe IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has \ngot the jump on them.  HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to \nstop running...she's too close.  Almost at the last moment, she jumps.  \nclaws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air.  She hits the deck \nand quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper.\n\nBROKEN TUSK stops.  ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of \nnearby drainage ducts.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nHIROKO slips into the chopper's pilot seat.  She flips a bunch of \nswitches and the turbines RISE in VOLUME from a LOW WHINE to a DULL \n<b>ROAR. \n</b>\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nAn orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind BROKEN TUSK.  With the \nALIENS blocking his path, there's no refuge for him. Almost.  The \nNavigation Tower looms overhead, nearby.  BROKEN TUSK takes a \ncalculated risk and LEAPS for it.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe heli-jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter.

I can play cavalry, too...\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nBROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can.  As the top of the \ntower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array.\n\nThe IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is \nalmost upon him.  The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat \nof a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing.  It CRASHES into \nthe QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork.  She \nHISSES, lashing out at the creature.  Sends it hurtling to the ground.\n\n<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nBROKEN TUSK makes it to the top.  There's not much space on the catwalk \nto maneuver.  He looks around, then down.  This is his last stand. \nInstinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct \ncomputer.

She HOLLERS at \nthe PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>C'mon!  Jump!\n\nBROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option \navailable to him.  He jumps.\n\nTHWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, \nit's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and \nthrough the door as...\n\n...KER-BLAM!

About a dozen or so people are milling \naround, smoking cigarettes or talking.\n\nMATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler.  \nThey feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward.\n\nTheir P.O.V. \nAbove the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon...\n\n<b>MATT\n</b>Holy shit!\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nGauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the \nturbulence out.\n\n<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nA chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the \nchopper's starboard engine.  There's a BURST of flame, then the \nextinguishers cut in.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height \nrapidly.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>We've lost the starboard engine!  We're going down!  Hold on!\n\n<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nHIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls.  \nThe glass cracks with the impact.\n\n<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.  \n</b>Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through \nthe canopy of foliage.\n\n<b>EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH, \nspraying mud all around.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe canopy implodes.  A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit, \nspraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.  She SCREAMS.\n\n<b>EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe chopper comes to rest in the swamp.  The SQUAWKING of the local \nWILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down.\n\n<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nHIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.  There's a nasty gash across her \nforehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.  The door frame on his side is \nbuckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end \nimpaling him through the shoulder.  The PREDATOR coughs luminous green \nblood.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>We've gotta get you out of here.\n\n<b>EXT.  SWAMP - DAWN\n</b>\nThe sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to \nthe other side.  She manages to get the mangled door open.  BROKEN \nTUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.\n\n<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)\n</b>Hold on.  This is gonna hurt some.\n\nHIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.  The PREDATOR braces \nhimself, and starts to move.  The agony is excruciating; his mandibles \nopen and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR.\n\nHIROKO helps him out of the seat.  The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his \nfeet. What happens next is totally unexpected.\n\nBROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.  Shocked, HIROKO \ngets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.  She looks up.\n\nThe ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's \nsledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements.\n\nThe PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying \nblade-down in the mire.  HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling \naway.  She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her.\n\nThe ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents \nface each other like sumo wrestlers.  HIROKO assumes a defensive \nstance, holding the disc ready to strike.  The ALIEN hisses, it's tail \nstinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.  The \nALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and \ntime again.  With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the \nbiomechanoid's body.  One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to \nthe floor, it's stinger arching towards her.  She parries, slicing the \ntail in half and struggling to her feet.\n\nThe ALIEN strikes again.  HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one \nof it's hands.  The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her \nand sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip.\n\nShe's lost, and the creature knows it.  It's lips curl into a SNARL.\n\nKER-POW!  KER-POW!  The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body \nslumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK \npointing the pulse\nrifle.\n\nThe dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.  HIROKO stumbles across \nto him.  BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from \nit's throat.  It gazes up at HIROKO.\n\n<b>BROKEN TUSK\n</b>Not...a pretty...sight...\n\nAnd with that, the PREDATOR dies.\n\nHIROKO look around.  The sun is rising above the treetops, and the \nsetting is serene.  Somehow beautiful.\n\nThe speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her.\n\nVOICE   (O.S., on speakers)\nRimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp \nBattalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell.  \nPlease respond.  Over.\n\nThere's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP.  HIROKO surveys the horizon.\n\nHIROKO's P.O.V.  \nA pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their \nweapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the \nground far below.\n\nA shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun.  A monstrous SHAPE \noccupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration.  The \nPREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing \ngear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper.\n\nHIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out.  BROKEN TUSK's body is \nborne aloft and carried back inside.  The LEAD PREDATOR turns to \nHIROKO.  He crosses to her.  HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted \neyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet.\n\nThe extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear.  KER-CHUNK!  \nThe tips lock into place.  The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO.  She \naccepts, a little confused.\n\nThere's a long moment.  The PREDATOR is still standing there.  Waiting. \nHIROKO's eyes narrow.  Her mind is working furiously.  What do they \nwant?\n\nShe realises.  It suddenly becomes clear.  She smiles.\n\n<b>HIROKO\n</b>Yeah.  Why not.\n\nHIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the \nwaiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back.\n\nThe PREDATOR follows her.  The ramp SLAMS closed, as we...\n\n<b>CUT TO BLACK\n</b><b>THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Alien vs. Predator</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Peter Briggs\" title=\"Scripts by Peter Briggs\">Peter Briggs</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Alien vs. Predator Script.html#comments\" title=\"Alien vs. Predator comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:58:12.151552"}
