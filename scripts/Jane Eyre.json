A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.\r\n                         \r\n          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed\r\n          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked\r\n          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of\r\n          belongings over her shoulder.\r\n                         \r\n          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,\r\n          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is\r\n          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.\r\n                         \r\n          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward\r\n          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.\r\n                         \r\n          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself\r\n          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.\r\n                         \r\n          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running\r\n          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an\r\n          approaching coach. She flags it down.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at\r\n          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod\r\n          indicates she can get in.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look\r\n          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early\r\n          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her\r\n          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -\r\n          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear\r\n          the day, she closes her eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.\r\n                         \r\n          Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads\r\n          meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.\r\n          With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open\r\n          moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off\r\n          at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane\r\n          puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is\r\n          not there.\r\n                         \r\n          She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding\r\n          towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,\r\n          alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.\r\n                         \r\n          She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the\r\n          gathering dark.\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The\r\n          night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She\r\n          is trying to calm herself with a prayer.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.\r\n          She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard\r\n          crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light\r\n          fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around\r\n          her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her\r\n          side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.\r\n                         \r\n          Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She\r\n          sits up. She is alone.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The\r\n          sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the\r\n          stones. Jane makes no movement.\r\n                         \r\n          A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled\r\n          with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the\r\n          bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches\r\n          the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the\r\n          farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould\r\n          of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She\r\n          eats it ravenously.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She\r\n          is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up\r\n          at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.\r\n                         \r\n          She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown\r\n          walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,\r\n          looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is\r\n          struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.\r\n                         \r\n          She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed\r\n          against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the\r\n          point of despair.\r\n                         \r\n          The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.\r\n          Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light\r\n          shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the\r\n          light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning\r\n          shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on\r\n          the gate.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,\r\n          she peers through a window.\r\n                         \r\n          On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.\r\n          They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in\r\n          black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides\r\n          her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very\r\n          young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.\r\n          They are talking intimately.\r\n                         \r\n          They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy\r\n          that it pains Jane considerably.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers.\r\n          She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.\r\n                         \r\n                          HANNAH\r\n           What do you want?\r\n                         \r\n          Jane manages to find her voice.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Shelter.\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          HANNAH\r\n           I can't take in vagrants.

And if there\r\n           are others with you tell them we\r\n           are not alone. We have a\r\n           gentleman here, and dogs.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n                          (DESPERATE)\r\n           But I must die if I am turned\r\n           away.\r\n                         \r\n          The door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n           God help me. I will die.\r\n                         \r\n          She turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds\r\n          herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms.\r\n                         \r\n                          ST JOHN\r\n           All of God's creatures must die.\r\n           But not prematurely - and not on\r\n           my doorstep I hope.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face\r\n          of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers. He\r\n          lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN.\r\n                         \r\n          A fire is roaring in the stove. Hannah is bent over it.\r\n                         \r\n                          HANNAH\r\n           We've had a beggar woman come, Mr\r\n           Rivers.

She can barely stand.\r\n          She is soaked to the bone, filthy with mud. Her skin has a\r\n          ghastly pallor. Diana and Mary enter.\r\n                         \r\n                          DIANA\r\n           St John, who is it?\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ST JOHN\r\n           I don't know; I found her at the\r\n           door.\r\n                         \r\n                          HANNAH\r\n                          (GUILTILY)\r\n           I thought her one of the gypsies\r\n           from the cross.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           She's as white as death.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane can hold herself up no longer.

Where are you?\r\n                         \r\n          Jane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - A GRAND RECEPTION ROOM.\r\n                         \r\n          Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking\r\n          hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.\r\n                         \r\n          She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen\r\n          year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He\r\n          is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN REED\r\n           Come out, rat. I know you are in\r\n           here. Come out now and I won't\r\n           punish you.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane watches him pass by her.

She slowly pulls\r\n          the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary.\r\n          There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her\r\n          book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs\r\n          her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves\r\n          plunging on to a shore.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. AN ARCTIC COAST.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated\r\n          rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black\r\n          cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away.\r\n                         \r\n           ST JOHN (V.O.)\r\n           Diana, Mary help me get her\r\n           upstairs...\r\n                         \r\n          The cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak.\r\n          Jane watches as it takes off and flies away.\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the\r\n          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.\r\n          Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in\r\n          front of her. Jane shrinks back.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN REED\r\n           I have been looking for you these\r\n           last ten minutes.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           What do you want?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN REED\r\n           Say forgive me, Master Reed.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           I have done nothing wrong.

Jane hits her head on the window clasp,\r\n          drawing blood. She is shocked.\r\n                         \r\n           JOHN REED (CONT'D)\r\n           That's for the look you had on\r\n           your face. You bad animal.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her\r\n          released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way\r\n          she can. She is barely coherent.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Wicked and cruel - you are a\r\n           slaver - a murderer -\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n           I shall tell mother -\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           I hate you John Reed.

Like all bullies, he is terrified.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n           Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat!\r\n                         \r\n          Jane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on\r\n          the scene. John screams. We see Mrs Reed's shocked face.\r\n          She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright,\r\n          elaborate dress.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM\r\n                         \r\n          Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes\r\n          off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed,\r\n          approaching a delirium. She resists them.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two\r\n          servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her.\r\n          She is still resisting.\r\n                         \r\n                          BESSIE\r\n           For shame, hitting your master.\r\n                         \r\n                          MISS ABBOT\r\n           If you don't sit still you must\r\n           be tied down!\r\n                         \r\n          The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,\r\n          young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She\r\n          has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.\r\n                         \r\n                          BESSIE\r\n           What we do is for your own good.\r\n           If you are passionate and rude\r\n           like this, your Aunt Reed will\r\n           send you away.\r\n                         \r\n                          MISS ABBOT\r\n           You're worse than us servants. We\r\n           work for our keep; you do\r\n           nothing. Pray for forgiveness\r\n           Miss Eyre or something bad will\r\n           come down that chimney and fetch\r\n           you away.\r\n                         \r\n          The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge\r\n          of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and\r\n          curtains, murky in the fading light.\r\n                         \r\n          In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.\r\n          Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale\r\n          reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on\r\n          pillars of mahogany, hung with red.\r\n           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white.\r\n          Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.\r\n                         \r\n          A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like\r\n          fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of\r\n          the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the\r\n          pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in\r\n          the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,\r\n          her eyes glittering with fear.\r\n                         \r\n          It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly\r\n          grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.\r\n          She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her\r\n          ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.\r\n                         \r\n          Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something\r\n          shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is\r\n          surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking\r\n          glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally\r\n          rips from Jane's throat.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DUSK.

The whole room is an\r\n          advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and\r\n          testament to the hours she has spent alone.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm so glad you are come. To be\r\n           sure this is a fine old house but\r\n           I must confess that in winter one\r\n           can feel a little dreary and\r\n           alone. Leah is a very nice girl\r\n           and John and Martha good people\r\n           too, but they are servants - and\r\n           one cannot talk to them on terms\r\n           of equality.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Am I to have the pleasure of\r\n           meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?\r\n                         \r\n                          MRS FAIRFAX\r\n           Who?\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Miss Fairfax - my pupil?\r\n                         \r\n                          MRS FAIRFAX\r\n           Oh you mean Miss Varens; Mr\r\n           Rochester's ward.

A dark,\r\n          voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped, one\r\n          full breast exposed.

She holds her candle up to the\r\n          portrait of the voluptuous woman.\r\n                         \r\n          She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.\r\n          She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has\r\n          achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing\r\n          laugh in the darkness behind her.

She hears\r\n          the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert\r\n          with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.\r\n                         \r\n          To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n           Who sleeps up here?\r\n                         \r\n                          MRS FAIRFAX\r\n           No one.

It\r\n           agitates me to pain that the sky-\r\n           line over there is ever our\r\n           limit.

DAY. A FROZEN MEADOW.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.\r\n          The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,\r\n          turning the frost gold.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow\r\n          trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,\r\n          acutely aware of everything around her.\r\n                         \r\n          Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across\r\n          the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her\r\n          feet echoes. She steadies herself.\r\n                         \r\n          She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A\r\n          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and\r\n          begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if\r\n          the whole winter is contained in it.\r\n                         \r\n          The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the\r\n          beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.\r\n                         \r\n          Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which\r\n          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.\r\n          The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush\r\n          of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before\r\n          she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments\r\n          startle both horse and rider.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           What the deuce -\r\n                         \r\n          The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only\r\n          to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall\r\n          with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo\r\n          with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,\r\n          trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           Hellfire.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is confounded.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           Pilot, get down!

He manages to get himself\r\n          off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches\r\n          him. She now has the moon on her face.

THORNFIELD - THE HALL/LANDING.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is crossing the landing holding Adele's hand.\r\n          Downstairs, the library doors swing wide open. The sound of\r\n          male laughter can be heard; gentlemen walk out into the\r\n          hall. Rochester follows, walking with a stick.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADELE\r\n           Monsieur!\r\n                         \r\n          All eyes turn upon the landing. Jane tries to find a shadow\r\n          to back into but there are none. Adele curtsies.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           Ah, there she is...\r\n                         \r\n          It is unclear whether he is referring to Adele or Jane. He\r\n          makes a bow. The men are staring at Jane with great\r\n          curiosity. It makes her uncomfortable. She tugs Adele away.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. NIGHT.

She studies\r\n          Rochester. He is intent on Adele, who is pulling a pink\r\n          satin dress out of the box.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm not fond of children.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADELE\r\n           Oh Ciel!

Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in.\r\n          She hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside\r\n          her door - low and deep.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Who's there?\r\n                         \r\n          Footsteps run away.

A door shuts at the end of the corridor.\r\n                         \r\n          There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush\r\n          matting, flickering in the draft. Jane picks it up. She\r\n          notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.\r\n          She follows its trail through the pitch darkness. It is\r\n          coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the\r\n          house - Rochester's.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings,\r\n          the curtains, all are alight. The flames are leaping.\r\n          Rochester is asleep. She shakes him.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n           Wake up! Wake up! Sir!\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester only stirs.

She\r\n          takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           Who's there?\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains. She\r\n          pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the\r\n          burning couch. When all the flames are out, she rushes to\r\n          the windows and opens them. Smoke billows out. She stands\r\n          in the moonlight, coughing.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester is sitting up, staring at her.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           What in the name of all the elves in\r\n           Christendom have you done with me?\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           For heaven's sake get up.

DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters\r\n          Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been\r\n          returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down\r\n          on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives\r\n          Sophie the sheets.\r\n                         \r\n          Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down\r\n          the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet.

THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table\r\n          in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity -\r\n          except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by\r\n          the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the\r\n          hired under cooks are talking abut her.\r\n                         \r\n                          UNDER COOK\r\n           She gets good wages, I'd guess?\r\n                         \r\n                          LEAH\r\n           Wish I had as good; not one fifth\r\n           what Mrs Poole receives.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEAH (CONT'D)\r\n           And she's laying it all by.

She nudges the under\r\n          cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As\r\n          she passes she hears:\r\n                         \r\n           UNDER COOK (CONT'D)\r\n           Doesn't she know?\r\n                         \r\n          At that moment, Adele rushes in.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADELE\r\n           They're here! They're here!\r\n                         \r\n          Mrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off. She becomes\r\n          flustered. Jane helps her.\r\n                         \r\n                          MRS FAIRFAX\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          Mrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window.\r\n                         \r\n          Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the\r\n          arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at\r\n          his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines\r\n          behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just\r\n          as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands\r\n          back in a dark corner.\r\n                         \r\n          There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A\r\n          flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They\r\n          descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche\r\n          Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Excuse me, miss.\r\n                         \r\n          Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of\r\n          the stairs.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           Good evening.\r\n                         \r\n          They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He\r\n          offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks\r\n          back into the shadows.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           May I?\r\n                         \r\n          Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely\r\n          touching him. They glide away.\r\n          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 63.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL.\r\n                         \r\n          Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and\r\n          Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to\r\n          feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful\r\n          note, she involuntarily closes her eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          Adele leans into Jane. She is crying.\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           What is it, darling?\r\n                         \r\n                          ADELE\r\n           She sing like Maman.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane, full of compassion, takes Adele back to her room.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Her lip curls in distaste.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of\r\n          refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the\r\n          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.\r\n                         \r\n          When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of\r\n          vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses\r\n          her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work\r\n          on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes\r\n          from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -\r\n          and of her love.

She is dressed in a nightgown -\r\n          like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil;\r\n          a phantom bride.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is paralysed with terror.\r\n                         \r\n          The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half;\r\n          bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last\r\n          thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly.\r\n          Her eyes are glittering with hatred.\r\n                         \r\n          The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane.

Jane sits, her\r\n          terror dawning. Her breath comes in great dry sobs.

She curls\r\n          into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength.\r\n          Rochester senses something is wrong.

Rochester is contrite.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The\r\n          rook wheels around the spire.

Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring\r\n          something in a pot.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no\r\n          window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a\r\n          mattress on the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRACE\r\n           Sir, you can't be bringing folk\r\n           in here. It's madness.\r\n                         \r\n          Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her\r\n          visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook\r\n          feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER\r\n           This clothed hyena is my wife.\r\n                         \r\n          Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows\r\n          triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with\r\n          Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           I was duped into marriage with\r\n           this lunatic fifteen years ago.\r\n                         \r\n          Briggs and Wood are deeply repelled.\r\n                         \r\n                          WOOD\r\n           Let us go.

He struggles with her.\r\n                         \r\n          Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.\r\n          Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on\r\n          her knees, her arms behind her.\r\n                         \r\n          Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could\r\n          express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane\r\n          turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DAY.

My\r\n           senses were besotted and I married\r\n           her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed\r\n           blockhead that I was.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester sits, staring at the fire.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           I lived with her for four years.\r\n           She dragged me through all the\r\n           degrading agonies which attend\r\n           those bound to the intemperate and\r\n           unchaste. Her excesses developed\r\n           germs of madness and the doctors\r\n           shut her up. One night, unable to\r\n           bear her screaming hate and knowing\r\n           I could never be rid of her, I put\r\n           a gun to my head to kill myself.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is both appalled and moved.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           I would have pulled the trigger,\r\n           died in that tropical place but for\r\n           a breeze which blew in from the sea\r\n           and smelt of home. With it, I came\r\n           to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta\r\n           Mason had abused my long suffering,\r\n           sullied my name, outraged my honour\r\n           and blighted my youth. It was\r\n           enough. At that moment, as I\r\n           decided to live, she ceased to be\r\n           my wife.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 98.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)\r\n           Only my father and brother knew of\r\n           the marriage and by then they were\r\n           both dead.

She was\r\n           disowned by her family and two\r\n           years later the rash pair were both\r\n           dead. They left a daughter which\r\n           charity received into her lap - as\r\n           cold as that snow drift I almost\r\n           stuck fast in. Charity carried the\r\n           friendless thing to the house of\r\n           its rich maternal relations. It was\r\n           reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to\r\n           names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane starts. She is on her feet.\r\n                         \r\n           ST JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n           Mrs Reed kept the orphan ten years\r\n           and at the end of that time she was\r\n           sent to Lowood school.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 103.\r\n                         \r\n           ST JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n           It seems her career there was very\r\n           honourable. She became a teacher\r\n           like yourself, and left it, like\r\n           yourself, to be a governess. She\r\n           undertook the education of the ward\r\n           of a certain Mr Rochester -\r\n                         \r\n                          JANE\r\n           Mr Rivers! -\r\n                         \r\n                          ST JOHN\r\n           I can guess your feelings but hear\r\n           me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's\r\n           character I know nothing but he\r\n           professed to offer honourable\r\n           marriage to this young girl and at\r\n           the very altar she discovered that\r\n           he had a wife yet alive. His\r\n           subsequent conduct is a matter of\r\n           pure conjecture but when the\r\n           governess was enquired after it was\r\n           discovered that she had fled\r\n           Thornfield Hall and no trace of her\r\n           has since been found.

It comes pounding towards\r\n          her. She hails it. This time, the coachman respectfully\r\n          descends to take her bag and help her on. She is so\r\n          confident and so changed that he doesn't recognise her.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is walking through the orchard. It is wild, neglected.\r\n          Its untended state worries her. She looks up. Rooks are\r\n          circling, cawing.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Jane finds herself at the side of the house. The ground is\r\n          pitted with weeds. The windows are dark. She half runs\r\n          round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.\r\n                         \r\n          The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.\r\n          Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has\r\n          collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred\r\n          remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.\r\n          Jane gazes in horror and distress.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          I/E. DAY.

He\r\n           only went out at night, when he\r\n           walked like a ghost through the\r\n           grounds.\r\n                         \r\n          We see what he is looking at: an open carriage piled with\r\n          luggage, into which Mrs Fairfax is helping Adele. Leah and\r\n          Sophie are already sitting inside, dressed for a journey.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n           He'd have no one near him. Adele\r\n           was sent off to school. He placed\r\n           me here. Only John and Martha\r\n           stayed - and Mrs Poole of course.\r\n                         \r\n          Adele looks back at Rochester with tears in her eyes. He\r\n          walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. EVENING.

No one knows how she\r\n           got out.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester hears a cry from the top floor. He sets off, a\r\n          look of finality on his face.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. EVENING.

She calmly walks towards him.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester graciously bows, indicating that she may leave.\r\n          Bertha glides past him.

She tips it to the\r\n          floor. It smashes. Rochester pays it no heed.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.\r\n                         \r\n          Rochester has stood Bertha at his desk. A case of jewels is\r\n          open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond\r\n          necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She\r\n          turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned.\r\n          Bertha begins to laugh.\r\n                         \r\n          She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires\r\n          herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers,\r\n          the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge\r\n          curtains alight.\r\n          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. As she\r\n          passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding. She has run the\r\n          brooch pin across him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. EVENING.

THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR\r\n                         \r\n          The conflagration is growing. Rochester sees Bertha leaving\r\n          Jane's room. As he passes, he sees everything inside it\r\n          being consumed by fire. He can't bear to look.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS.\r\n                         \r\n          Bertha is watching the rooks. Rochester goes to the edge of\r\n          the roof. Bertha looks at him. The invitation is clear.\r\n          Rochester is ready to die.\r\n                         \r\n          Bertha sees the rooks wheeling away. She runs at the edge\r\n          of the roof. Rochester sees her intention too late. He puts\r\n          out his arm to stop her.\r\n                         \r\n          For the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies.\r\n          Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves\r\n          himself.\r\n                         \r\n          Life reawakens in him.

DAY. FERNDEAN - THE GROUNDS.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.\r\n          Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes\r\n          to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between\r\n          granite pillars. She walks through them.\r\n                         \r\n          She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor\r\n          house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow\r\n          grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.\r\n                         \r\n          Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He\r\n          is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,\r\n          brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking\r\n          sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a\r\n          hawk. His strength is undiminished.\r\n                         \r\n          He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into\r\n          the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough\r\n          for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,\r\n          silent.\r\n                         \r\n          A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his\r\n          right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky\r\n          as if he is looking for something from there. He is\r\n          absolutely still; his expression, serene.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a\r\n          loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is\r\n          immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.\r\n          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of\r\n          it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.\r\n          Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.\r\n                         \r\n          He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns\r\n          and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears\r\n          into the dark interior.\r\n                         \r\n          Jane starts to breathe again.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.
