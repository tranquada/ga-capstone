GOLF COURSE - DAWN\n\n\tVARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of \n\tbrilliant greens:\n\n\tA POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD\n\n\tpops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-\n\tsoaked lawn.\n\n\tFLEET OF DUCKLINGS\n\n\tNo mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.\n\n\tGRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER\n\n\tAt the bottom of a water hazard.\n\n\tPALM FRONDS\n\n\tAfter a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that \n\tsurrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the \n\tair. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt \n\tCobain suet of \"WHAT I DID FOR LOVE,\" as we CRANE DOWN the \n\tpalms to\n\n\tA BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.\n\n\tJust on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers \n\tmoves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips \n\tit out. The trousers walk out after it.\n\n\tHANDS\n\n\tDigging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a \n\tgolf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are \n\tgloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.\n\n\tYELLOW TROUSERS\n\n\tIn a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot \n\tjourney to the hole. The figure positions himself and the \n\tputter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball \n\trolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards \n\tand finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green \n\tand into the hole.\n\n\tTHE GLOVED HAND\n\n\tSets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather \n\tgolf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the \n\tbag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing \n\tout a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. \n\tThe figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot \n\tfirmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the \n\tface of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-\n\tsquat. He is MARTIN BLANK.\n\n\tWe SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with \n\thim. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, \n\tanother green is barely visible through groves of trees and \n\trough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. \n\tOne of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He \n\tcould be an investment banker, or an arms trader.\n\n\tMARTIN'S ARM\n\n\tFlinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second \n\tlater in the distance, the\n\n\tRED SWEATER'S HEAD\n\n\tSeems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His \n\tbody crumples to the green.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tReturns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to \n\tthe tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers \n\tabsently...\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tHooked it. \n\n\tINT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER\n\n\tThe outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf \n\tclub. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between \n\ta group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like \n\tpeace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tI'd come to the realization that \n\t\teverything I'd based my life on was \n\t\tfalse. And that my life had no \n\t\tmeaning.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #2\n\t\t\t(to Martin)\n\t\tHe gets this way when he hits over \n\t\teighty-five.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tIt seemed like my life was slipping \n\t\taway, somehow. I was a knot in the \n\t\tmiddle of a wet rope. Everything was \n\t\tfutile and nothing had value.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #3\n\t\tThat's the way life is. The only \n\t\tmeaning and value is what we create. \n\t\tThrough structure, and discipline. \n\t\tThough they seem to limit our freedom, \n\t\tthey actually give us great comfort. \n\t\tYour problem is you're looking for \n\t\tsome great answer. Some ultimate \n\t\ttruth. When what you really should \n\t\tdo is go to work and go home.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #2\n\t\tAnd take golf lessons.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tThat's a tragedy. Can I finish my \n\t\tstory please? I began my search for \n\t\tmeaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, \n\t\tScientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I \n\t\twent to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, \n\t\therbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, \n\t\tand a psychic. And they all pretty \n\t\tmuch say the same stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #2\n\t\tA Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are \n\t\ttelling you the same thing? You're \n\t\tinsane.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tBasically the same thing. In a very \n\t\tevolved, esoteric way.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #2\n\t\tInsane.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tTo make a long story short...\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #3\n\t\t--Thank God--\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\t...at last I found the holistic system \n\t\tof systems that opened up the doors \n\t\tof heaven for me right here on earth. \n\t\tAnd everyday I see the world through \n\t\tthe eyes of a child. A world of \n\t\tcreation and wonder.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #2\n\t\tJesus...\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tOverflowing with love.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tTell me about it.\n\n\tClub Member #1 turns to Martin.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tP.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the \n\t\tsecrets of your universe are divided \n\t\tup into eight easily digestible \n\t\tslices.\n\n\tClub Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and \n\thands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to \n\twail.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tSee, see. It's in the accessible and \n\t\teveryday shape of a pan pizza. Each \n\t\tday you have a little slice of \n\t\tpeace...\n\n\tINSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD\n\n\tA pizza-shaped diagram showing six \"sections\".\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tOh I see. You got your individual \n\t\tslices of hope, dignity, confidence, \n\t\tself-love, justice, and harmony.\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tYou open 'em up and there's the \n\t\tsayings, stories, little bites of \n\t\tinsight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day \n\t\tWeek.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tSo you eat-- read it everyday?\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tAnd these pan pizzas have opened up \n\t\tthe doors to heaven?\n\n\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #1\n\t\tCorrect.\n\t\t\t(re: the card)\n\t\tThat's for you. Keep it.\n\n\tSirens are getting louder, closer to the club.\n\n\tEXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\n\tThe source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks \n\ttoward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets \n\tthe Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN AT CAR\n\t\tHe fishes out the laminated \"Personal \n\t\tPan Power\" card, looks at it, and \n\t\ttosses it onto the ground. Police \n\t\tcars, now visible in the distance, \n\t\twind into the long club driveway. \n\t\tMartin gets into his car and pulls \n\t\taway.\n\n\tLAMINATED CARD\n\n\tAs it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls \n\tto a stop on it.\n\n\tINT. AIRLINER - DAY\n\n\tMartin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped \n\tdown. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines \n\tof all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, \n\tRolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, \n\tand on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, \n\timpassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is \n\tdone with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to \n\thim and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and \n\tmassively uploading the world around him:\n\n\tToothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, \n\tcrouched starving child with vulture in the background, \n\tsupermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm \n\tin arm, smiling, etc.\n\n\tINT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY\n\n\tThe livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. \n\tMartin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having \n\talready begun.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tHow was your day, today, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tEffective. But to tell you the truth, \n\t\tI've lost my passion for work.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tDo you like the people you work with?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI work alone.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tThat's it then. That's it. I've always \n\t\tbeen alone. That's why I'm a good \n\t\tdriver. I can handle it. See, I can \n\t\tthink on my feet. I survive, I'm a \n\t\tthinker. And I can sit there in front \n\t\tof your house for two hours and it \n\t\tdon't bother me. Some people can't \n\t\tdo it! Some people are ranting and \n\t\traving, \"Tell them fuckin' people to \n\t\tget out here and get in this car, I \n\t\tcan't-- I want a go!\" Where you gonna \n\t\tgo? You're gonna wind up back in \n\t\tyour garage at seven o'clock at night. \n\t\tYou ain't going nowhere. You leave \n\t\tyour house in the morning you get \n\t\tback to your house in the evening. \n\t\tWhat's the big deal, right?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tYou understand the psychology of the \n\t\tjob.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tI do. Some guys can't adjust to it; \n\t\tthey can't handle it.\n\n\tINT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER\n\n\tThe car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the \n\tDriver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tYou look like you're far away. Far \n\t\taway and thinking about other things. \n\t\tI'm right about that, aren't I?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tWell, let's just say that sometimes \n\t\tI'm right. Sometimes you are.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tSometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only \n\t\tnatural.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\t\t(laughs to himself at \n\t\t\tthis great truth)\n\t\tIt's only natural....\n\n\tThe Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tI been looking at you, and I've \n\t\tdecided that I want to share something \n\t\twith you.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tBecause your problem is you're bored. \n\t\tAnd you have a very big mind.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI am part of what I call a brain \n\t\tsyndicate.\n\n\tNo reaction from Martin.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tI am part of a network of minds, a \n\t\tgroup of five people who are all \n\t\tconnected, over hundreds, even \n\t\tthousands of miles, through the mind. \n\t\tWe can think with each other, think \n\t\tfor each other. I can be driving \n\t\tsomewhere, sleeping with a woman-- \n\t\twhatever it is-- and at the same \n\t\ttime be thinking a thought in someone \n\t\telse's mind, far away. Running someone \n\t\telse's brain.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\t\t(indicates)\n\t\tUp on the right.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DRIVER\n\t\tAnd when you think of it, it's not \n\t\tso surprising that a small group of \n\t\tpeople control the whole world, is \n\t\tit?\n\n\tINT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY\n\n\tA sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper \n\tEast Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows \n\twatching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across \n\tthe street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts \n\tit back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves \n\tto the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, \n\tdepresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for \n\ta moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tIf it's not there, I can't proceed. \n\t\tTell them.\n\n\tMartin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he \n\twaits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying \n\ton the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tTom. I've been waiting for an answer. \n\t\tI'm only in town tonight.\n\n\tHe breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished \n\tmetal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a \n\tsilencer.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tWhat's different this time than the \n\t\tlast time? I have to be down front...\n\n\tINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME\n\n\tMartin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the \n\tscope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests \n\tacross the arm of a chair.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\t...I don't bother to call anyone \n\t\telse because you always take care of \n\t\tme.\n\n\tHe glances over to a second window to his left, which offers \n\ta view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the \n\tscope and sees\n\n\tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2\n\n\tA few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, \n\tis your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing \n\tgear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across \n\this right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is \n\thidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tHold on a second, Tom. I got my hands \n\t\tfull here.\n\n\tHe sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching \n\tthe messenger.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tGood. Account number 3649367, transfer \n\t\tto account number 96-546-38739-47825. \n\t\tAsk for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's \n\t\tMr. Duckman. If there are any \n\t\tproblems, access file 673594638-IO-\n\t\t98, and look at it.\n\n\tMartin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the \n\trifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the \n\thigh-rise.\n\n\tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1\n\n\tOf a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in \n\tsuits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth \n\tman, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in \n\tSaville Row finery.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tTakes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises \n\tthe rifle toward Window #2.\n\n\tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2\n\n\tof an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tconcentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him \n\tleft to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall \n\tbetween Window #2 and Window #1.\n\n\tSTREET\n\n\tthe bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing \n\ta Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- \n\tjust as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. \n\tTwo of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other \n\ttwo open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into \n\ta parked car in front of them.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\twithdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and \n\tbegins to break down the rifle.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tSorry Tom. But look, I know it's the \n\t\tplayoffs. That's why I'm offering a \n\t\tthousand dollars for one seat...\n\n\tMartin listens patiently as he works.\n\n\tEXT.

What do \n\t\tI have to do to get courtside tickets \n\t\tfor the Knicks...?\n\n\tSTREET\n\n\tThe two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other \n\ttwo begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The \n\tDoorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.\n\n\tDOORMAN\n\n\ta tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a \n\thandlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he \n\tflips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum \n\tCharthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tis closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tNever mind. I gotta go.\n\n\tMartin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the \n\twindow.\n\n\tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE\n\n\tof the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. \n\tHe gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman \n\tFIRES both guns.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\treacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself \n\tfrom the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his \n\texit.\n\n\tHIGH-RISE FOYER\n\n\tOutside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of \n\tbodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and \n\tmakes his way through the building toward the service exit. \n\tHe sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\this two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel \n\tand walks down the street.\n\n\tDOORMAN\n\n\tnow wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, \n\twalks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.\n\n\tINT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY\n\n\tMartin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again \n\ton the cellular.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\t...Tell them that's not my problem. \n\t\tI was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- \n\t\tnot two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARCELLA\n\t\tWait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tPatch him through....\n\n\tMartin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We \n\trecognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is \n\tGROCER.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tWhat do you want?\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER\n\t\tI'm setting up a concern that would \n\t\tenable those of us in our rarefied \n\t\tprofession to consolidate our efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tLike a union?\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER\n\t\tLike a club.

AIRLINER - DAY\n\n\tMartin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with \n\tan airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again \n\tspeeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. \n\tHe looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees \n\tand partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...\n\n\tINT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT\n\n\tMartin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily \n\tdrops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.\n\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\n\tMartin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On \n\tthe coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin \n\tbottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes \n\tthem down with a reddish-orange beverage.\n\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\n\tMartin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are \n\tclosed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps \n\this chest.\n\n\t\t\t\t  WOMAN (V.O.)\n\t\t\"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's \n\t\tbeen ten years?

His head turns to \n\tthe side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.\n\n\tCLOSE-UP: WIRE\n\n\tfrom the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with \n\tone unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a \n\twalkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the \n\tbox, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to \n\tthe floor.\n\n\t\t\t\t  WOMAN (V.O.)\n\t\t...Are you guiding an Outward Bound \n\t\tcanoe trip like Brook Stinson?

A fine thread \n\tsnakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. \n\tWe PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. \n\tKEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers \n\tthe thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole \n\tin the floor.\n\n\tMARTIN - A MINUTE LATER\n\n\tconcentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the \n\tthread. As the drops run down along the thread through the \n\tfloor, his attention shifts to the\n\n\tVIDEO MONITOR\n\n\tThe drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they \n\tmake their way down the line toward the sleeping man.\n\n\t\t\t\t  WOMAN (V.O.)\n\t\t...Could it be that you're like Chip \n\t\tLongfellow, at the trade-relations \n\t\ttank in Washington.

SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER\n\n\tMartin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and \n\tclassroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the \n\techoed strains of Iggy Pop's \"Wild Child\" from the distant \n\tgym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-\n\tback left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false \n\tceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, \n\tand withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He \n\tholds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He \n\tgrinds it into dust in his hand.\n\n\tINT.

He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over \n\teach hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. \n\tHe stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the \n\thall, and bangs through the doors.\n\n\tINT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tMartin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands \n\tlooking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found.

He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops \n\tnext to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses \n\tand looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses \n\tinto the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar \n\tand works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace.

With everything \n\tgone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the \n\tdoor and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...\n\n\tDebi moves past him into the room.

Why?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tIt was a cost-cutting effort. They \n\t\tcan't afford a recall.\n\n\t\t\t\t  NEWBERRY\n\t\tIt was a leaky sunroof! A design \n\t\tflaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! \n\t\tYou want to kill me because of that?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tIt's not me! Why does everybody think \n\t\tit's personal?!\n\n\tThey go through the front door and shut it behind them.\n\n\tINT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME\n\n\tGrocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.\n\n\tINT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME\n\n\tLardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within \n\tviewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into \n\tthe driveway.\n\n\t\t\t\t  LARDNER\n\t\tWe'll go in through the woods.\n\n\tINT. NEWBERRY HOUSE\n\n\tMartin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The \n\tcontents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. \n\tNewberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge \n\tDesert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to \n\tDebi.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI was sitting in my house on prom \n\t\tnight wearing that Goddamned rented \n\t\ttuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a \n\t\tbottle of champagne in the other. So \n\t\tI was just sitting there, and then \n\t\tthe whole night flashed before my \n\t\teyes, and it struck me like a bullet \n\t\tin the head-- I realized, finally, \n\t\tand for the first time, that... I \n\t\twanted to kill somebody. So I figured \n\t\tbecause I loved you so much, that'd \n\t\tit'd be a good idea if I didn't see \n\t\tyou anymore. But now I'm different.\n\n\tHe turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two \n\tshots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the \n\tdoor.\n\n\tMartin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. \n\tDebi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. \n\tNewberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with \n\tDebi. They stop at what they see:\n\n\tNEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.\n\n\tAs ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by \n\tMartin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush \n\tkit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, \n\ttheir guns rising up fast toward us.\n\n\tDebi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks \n\tit. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from \n\toutside.\n\n\tINT. KITCHEN - SAME\n\n\tMartin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. \n\tA barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls \n\tback behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN \n\tcomes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind \n\tthe cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI'm in love with you. I know we can \n\t\tmake this work!\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\trushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the \n\trange, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He \n\tsteps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises \n\tSHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers \n\tthe Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the \n\tkitchen.\n\n\tNEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH\n\n\tMartin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which \n\tis beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks \n\tat Debi.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI was afraid to commit to a \n\t\trelationship, but now I know I'm \n\t\tready to make it happen.\n\n\tMartin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently \n\tbe the wrists.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI just need time to change.\n\n\tHe ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back \n\tstairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at \n\tanother ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.\n\n\tHALLWAY\n\n\tHe leads them quickly.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tIt's not easy for me. I was raised \n\t\tto close off, to control my \n\t\tfeelings...\n\n\tHe takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN \n\tcoming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes \n\tDebi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out \n\tthrough the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tLock the door.\n\n\tThey do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something \n\tstraight.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI wasn't raised in a loving \n\t\tenvironment.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut that's not an excuse. It's a \n\t\treason.\n\n\tINT. FOYER\n\n\tMartin corners the banister and springs half-way down the \n\tstairs, then hears the front door begin to open.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tMy soul was empty--\n\n\tMartin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees \n\tGrocer beginning to slip in.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\t--and it's up to me to fill it.\n\n\tMartin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the \n\tslide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin \n\thears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, \n\ttossing the spent weapon.\n\n\tINT. BEDROOM\n\n\tAn ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while \n\tDebi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. \n\tThe Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of \n\tthe line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of \n\tAssassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\t\t(through the door)\n\t\tIt's okay. It's Martin The door begins \n\t\tto open revealing Debi and Newberry.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI know what I do isn't moral, per \n\t\tse, but if you could just look past \n\t\tthat, you'd see a man worth loving.\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER (O.S.)\n\t\tDon't listen to him, he's a \n\t\tprofessional.\n\n\tMartin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled \n\tvoice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER (O.S.)\n\t\tYou're breaking my heart down here, \n\t\tBlank. I can't shoot through the \n\t\ttears.\n\n\tMartin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead \n\tman. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze \n\tfirefight...\n\n\tEXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME\n\n\tLardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, \n\tabout to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.\n\n\t\t\t\t  LARDNER\n\t\tDid you see Blank in there?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MCCULLERS\n\t\tNo...\n\n\t\t\t\t  LARDNER\n\t\tGood. For a second there I thought \n\t\twe were in trouble.\n\n\tINT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\treaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading \n\tup the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to \n\tFIRE, when they hear...\n\n\tLARDNER AND MCCULLERS\n\n\tpower through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, \n\tala Butch and Sundance.\n\n\tMartin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and \n\tFIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls \n\tout of view.\n\n\tKITCHEN - INTERCUT\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\theads up the back stairs.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tworks his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the \n\tkitchen.\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\thears him and starts back down.\n\n\tMartin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes \n\tout of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as \n\tGrocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, \n\tcrouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the \n\tair toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining \n\troom, still firing.\n\n\tC.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION\n\n\tThe last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and \n\tthe slide on the auto locks back-- empty.\n\n\tNORMAL SPEED\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\tFlying through the air disappearing through the shuttered \n\tserving window, his flight carrying him past a television \n\tthat sits on a lazy susan.\n\n\tMARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT\n\n\tMartin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite \n\tside of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in \n\tthe dining room. The hulking old television sits on the \n\tcounter above and between them.\n\n\tMartin looks up and spies the TELEVISION\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER\n\t\t...How about I sell you two rounds \n\t\tfor a hundred grand a piece?\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\tMartin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it \n\tinto a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.\n\n\tBALLED CHECK\n\n\tsails over the television and comes down, bouncing off \n\tGrocer's head and into his lap.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tThere you go. I left it blank.\n\n\t\t\t\t  GROCER\n\t\tExcellent. Here they come.\n\n\tGrocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic \n\tand pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO \n\tBULLETS into the air.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\trises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO \n\tBULLETS sail past his head.\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\tbegins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his \n\tgun.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tputs all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin \n\tand the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\tgets off one round before\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tflies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television \n\tover his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, \n\tlanding on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see\n\n\tGROCER\n\n\tBody crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered \n\tpicture tube. He is dead.\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\truns up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he \n\tdiscarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.\n\n\tINT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER\n\n\tMartin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the \n\tedge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with \n\this arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back \n\tinto the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.\n\n\tMARTIN AND NEWBERRY\n\n\tMARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts \n\tit into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. \n\tMartin looks past Newberry.\n\n\tMARTIN'S P.O.V.\n\n\tOf Debi, head in hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN (V.O.)\n\t\tDebi... will you marry me?\n\n\tDebi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head \n\tstill down, and closes the bathroom door...\n\n\tINT. RADIO STATION - DAY\n\n\tOutside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, \n\tbringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...\n\n\t\t\t\t  DEBI\n\t\tThis is WRFN Radio Free Newberry \n\t\tcause that's what it does.

But first this \n\t\tcommercial. Back after this...\n\n\tShe pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, \n\tand answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio \n\tmonitor:\n\n\t\t\t\t  ANNOUNCER\n\t\tDon't miss the show of the season at \n\t\tBilkin Community Center! \"Brigadoon!\" \n\t\tA musical for all ages! \"Brigadoon,\" \n\t\tstarring Carol Plummer, Thomas \n\t\tCanchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee \n\t\tOrdman!...\n\n\tDebi picks up the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DEBI\n\t\tRFN...\n\n\tHer face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... \n\tThen she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of \n\tdead air, then she snaps to.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DEBI\n\t\tHey out there... Okay... I'm going \n\t\tto finish up that fantasy later. \n\t\tFirst I'll give you an hour of nonstop \n\t\tmusic... If I don't come back on \n\t\tafter that-- well, nevermind.\n\n\tDebi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.\n\n\tEXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tDebi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but \n\tstops dead when she sees\n\n\tMARTIN\n\n\tsitting on the front steps.\n\n\tDebi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the \n\tporch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. \n\tAfter a while...\n\n\t\t\t\t  DEBI\n\t\tThis will never work out.\n\n\tShe turns to him, serious.\n\n\t\t\t\t  DEBI\n\t\tYou kill people.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\n\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n\t\tI have no illusions about the future. \n\t\tWhat is, is.
