The trousers walk out after it.\n\n<b>\tHANDS\n</b>\n\tDigging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a \n\tgolf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are \n\tgloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.\n\n<b>\tYELLOW TROUSERS\n</b>\n\tIn a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot \n\tjourney to the hole. The figure positions himself and the \n\tputter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly.

He is MARTIN BLANK.\n\n\tWe SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with \n\thim. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, \n\tanother green is barely visible through groves of trees and \n\trough.

I was a knot in the \n\t\tmiddle of a wet rope. Everything was \n\t\tfutile and nothing had value.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  CLUB MEMBER #3\n</b>\t\tThat's the way life is. The only \n\t\tmeaning and value is what we create. \n\t\tThrough structure, and discipline. \n\t\tThough they seem to limit our freedom, \n\t\tthey actually give us great comfort. \n\t\tYour problem is you're looking for \n\t\tsome great answer.

He meets \n\tthe Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MARTIN AT CAR\n</b>\t\tHe fishes out the laminated \"Personal \n\t\tPan Power\" card, looks at it, and \n\t\ttosses it onto the ground.

The wheel of a police car rolls \n\tto a stop on it.\n\n<b>\tINT. AIRLINER - DAY\n</b>\n\tMartin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped \n\tdown. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines \n\tof all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, \n\tRolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, \n\tand on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, \n\timpassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is \n\tdone with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to \n\thim and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and \n\tmassively uploading the world around him:\n\n\tToothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, \n\tcrouched starving child with vulture in the background, \n\tsupermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm \n\tin arm, smiling, etc.\n\n<b>\tINT.

And I can sit there in front \n\t\tof your house for two hours and it \n\t\tdon't bother me. Some people can't \n\t\tdo it!

You're gonna wind up back in \n\t\tyour garage at seven o'clock at night. \n\t\tYou ain't going nowhere.

HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY\n</b>\n\tA sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper \n\tEast Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows \n\twatching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across \n\tthe street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts \n\tit back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves \n\tto the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, \n\tdepresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for \n\ta moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n</b>\t\tIf it's not there, I can't proceed. \n\t\tTell them.\n\n\tMartin hangs up.

He goes to it. He raises the \n\tscope and sees\n\n<b>\tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2\n</b>\n\tA few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, \n\tis your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing \n\tgear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across \n\this right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is \n\thidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n</b>\t\tHold on a second, Tom.

The group see him-- \n\tjust as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. \n\tTwo of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other \n\ttwo open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into \n\ta parked car in front of them.\n\n<b>\tMARTIN\n</b>\n\twithdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and \n\tbegins to break down the rifle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  MARTIN\n</b>\t\tSorry Tom.
