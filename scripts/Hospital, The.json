DAY. MAY,\n\n               PANORAMIC VIEW of The Hospital -- a vast medical complex, a \n               sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north \n               and south on First Avenue and east to the river.\n\n               The Hospital was founded in the late 19th century, and there \n               are still a few begrimed Victorian Bedlams and Bastilles \n               among the buildings. Mostly though, it is Medical Modern \n               1971, white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts \n               and rotundas. A spanking new Community Mental Health Clinic \n               towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex. \n               On the far side of First Avenue, a twenty-story apartment \n               house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house \n               the resident staff has just recently been completed, and \n               next to it, eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to \n               make way -- according to the construction company's sign -- \n               for a new Drug Rehabilitation Center, to be completed in \n               1973, we should all live so long. This is where the shattering \n               SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION are coming from. A block length of \n               generators and cement and demolition machines are POUNDING, \n               CRASHING, SCREAMING. Traffic HONKS and BRAYS up First Avenue.\n\n               It is a cold spring morning -- 10:00 A.M.\n\n               A 1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion.\n\n               A tiny, fragile, white-bearded OLD MAN, almost lost in his \n               overcoat, is helped from the rear of a station wagon and \n               slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged nurse.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         On Monday morning, a patient named \n                         Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was \n                         admitted to the hospital complaining \n                         of chest pains.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION. EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               The old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital \n               orderly down the corridor.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         He had been referred by a nursing \n                         home where the doctor had diagnosed \n                         his condition as angina pectoris. \n                         Now it is axiomatic that nursing \n                         home doctors are always wrong.\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               The old man, shirtless, is propped on the edge of the bed, \n               wheezing. DR. SCHAEFER, a young intern in white-uniform, \n               perches beside him with the old man's chart in his lap, taking \n               down his history. The other patient in the two-bedded room, \n               a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, is comatose and all rigged up with I.V.'s \n               and catheters.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey, \n                         however, accepted the diagnosis and \n                         prescribed morphine, a drug suitable \n                         for angina but not at all suitable \n                         for emphysema, which is, \n                         unfortunately, what the old man \n                         actually had. Within an hour...\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               Two orderlies rush the old man's bed with, of course, the \n               old man in it, past the Nurses' Station and into a waiting \n               elevator.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         ...the patient became unresponsive \n                         and diaphoretic and was raced up to \n                         Intensive Care with an irregular \n                         pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over \n                         60, respiration rapid and shallow.\n\n               INTENSIVE CARE\n\n               An oxygen mask is applied to the old man's face by the \n               resident.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         The resident on duty now compounded \n                         the blunder by treating the old man \n                         for pulmonary edema. He gave him \n                         digitalis, diuretics and oxygen. \n                         This restored the old man's color...\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               The elevator door opens.

EVENING\n\n               The old man is back in his room sleeping serenely, his tiny \n               body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers \n               him. The room is in hushed shadows. A yellowish light diffuses \n               into the room from the half-opened bathroom door. The other \n               patient in the room remains as before, comatose and silent.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         In point of fact, the patient was in \n                         CO2 narcosis...\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               All the lights are on now. NURSE PENNY CANDUSO and an orderly \n               are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud. BRUBAKER, \n               the senior resident, is giving hell to Schaefer, the intern.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         ...and died at seven-thirty that \n                         evening.\n\n               The shrouded body of the old man is wheeled out of the room. \n               CAMERA STAYS on the vacated bed.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         I mention all this, only to explain \n                         how the bed in Room 806 became \n                         available.\n\n               PAN from bed to Schaefer, now alone in the room and regarding \n               the empty bed with frowning interest. Schaefer is a scraggly \n               young fellow, bespectacled, with a contemporary mess of hair \n               and a swinging unkempt moustachio. HOLD on Schaefer.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         The intern involved was a prickly \n                         young buck named Schaefer who had a \n                         good thing going for him with a \n                         technician in the hematology lab. In \n                         the haphazard fashion of hospital \n                         romances, Dr. Schaefer had been \n                         zapping this girl on wheelchairs, \n                         stretchers, pantry shelves...\n\n               Dr. Schaefer moves for the phone on the table between the \n               two beds.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         ...in the kitchen, in the morgue, in \n                         the dark corners of corridors...\n\n               Schaefer speaks softly into the phone.\n\n                                     NARRATOR\n                         ...standing up, sitting down -- so \n                         you can imagine what an available \n                         bed meant to him.\n\n                                     SCHAEFER\n                              (on phone)\n                         Hey, Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. \n                         Hey listen. I got us a bed for \n                         tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.\n\n               FREEZE on CLOSE-UP of the beaming, lubricious Schaefer on \n               phone as\n\n               CREDITS AND MUSIC ERUPT ONTO THE SCREEN --\n\n                                       THE HOSPITAL\n\n               INTERSPERSED WITH CREDITS, the following scenes:\n\n               ROOM 806. NIGHT\n\n               Dark. Just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite \n               closed bathroom. The hallway door opens, and a young woman, \n               carrying a top coat, slips quickly in giggling like hell, \n               followed by Schaefer, who is likewise giggling and admonishing \n               her to be quiet. Her name is SHEILA. Sheila notices the other \n               patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at \n               Schaefer, who reassures her as he removes her coat. After \n               which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and \n               hangs them in the armoire. The girl asks in a hoarse whisper \n               if they're going to get totally nude and wonders if that's \n               such a good idea. For an answer, Schaefer fondles her crotch. \n               They both giggle, they both shush each other, they giggle \n               again; they're both stoned. The girl unzippers her dress. \n               The dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of \n               undressing, flung garments, elbows, legs and arms, bumpings \n               into each other, and Sheila saying between giggles, \"Boy, I \n               sure hope nobody walks in.\"\n\n               They eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed, and the scene \n               ends looking ACROSS the sleeping profile of THE PATIENT in \n               the other bed as Schaefer and his girl thump away at each \n               other with much creaking of springs, moans, groans, giggles \n               and the white-limbed patterns of fornication.\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               Dark, silent, hushed. The fun and games are over. Sheila is \n               in front of the armoire. She slips back into her dress, after \n               which she tiptoes back to the bed where Schaefer is deeply \n               asleep, smiling in postcoital peace. Sheila bends, shakes \n               his shoulder.\n\n                                     SHEILA\n                              (whispers)\n                         I'll see you.\n\n               Schaefer smiles, grunts, sleeps on.\n\n               END OF CREDITS.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               THE HOSPITAL. 6:30 A.M. NEXT MORNING, TUESDAY\n\n               A cold newly-dawned sun shines down on the vast sprawling \n               complex of the hospital. Desultory early morning traffic on \n               First Avenue.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR\n\n               The night shift of nurses is closing out another night's \n               work, which has been on the whole uneventful. The head nurse, \n               MRS. REARDON, hunches over her paperwork. NURSE ELIZABETH \n               RIVERS sits at the desk beside her, resting her head on the \n               palm of one hand. NURSE'S AID J.C. MILLER crosses with an \n               armful of linens. She disappears into the pharmacy and supply \n               areas behind the Nurses' Station. In the west corridor, NURSE \n               LUCINDA PEREZ glances at her watch, then pads down to Room \n               806. She enters.\n\n               ROOM 806. DAY\n\n               A cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room. Nurse \n               Perez checks the I.V. on the comatose patient who is in the \n               bed nearest the door. Then she turns to regard the other bed -- \n               which gives her pause.\n\n               NURSE'S P.O.V.: Intern Dr. Schaefer is lying on this bed, \n               rigid, eyes dilated, pupils staring unseeing. An I.V. tube \n               sticks out of his naked right arm. Nurse Perez doesn't quite \n               know what to make of the fact that Dr. Schaefer is lying on \n               that bed with an I.V. tube sticking out of him looking dead. \n               Frowning, she reaches out a tentative hand to shake his naked \n               shoulder.\n\n                                     NURSE PEREZ\n                         Doctor Schaefer...\n\n               There is, of course, no response. A terrible suspicion enters \n               Nurse Perez's mind, and she closes her eyes and sighs a long \n               shuddering sigh. Then she opens her eyes and, with a second \n               and briefer sigh, reaches for Schaefer's neck to take his \n               pulse. Clearly, the result is not encouraging. She sighs \n               another short sigh and regards Schaefer's unblinking, dilated \n               pupils. It's all a bit too much for her; she shuffles to the \n               window and stares out into the gray morning where things are \n               a little more comprehensible. Once again, she returns to the \n               bed, regards Schaefer's death mask. She raises the bedsheet \n               and, for one short but appreciative moment, considers \n               Schaefer's naked body.

Venetian blinds drawn. TV set on, a gray coarse-grained \n               square. PHONE RINGS.\n\n               DR. HERBERT BOCK, 53 years old, a large man, bulky, \n               disheveled, apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching \n               television the night before. The bed still has its spread on \n               but is rumpled. Bock is in trousers and shirt, collar opened, \n               barefooted. PHONE RINGS. The reading lamp is the only light \n               in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the \n               television. Newspapers litter the floor. Books, two-day-old \n               plates of food, yesterday's mugs of coffee, cigar-stuffed \n               ashtrays, a shirt, a pair of pants, a winter overcoat, a \n               battered gray fedora have been slung about. PHONE on the \n               bedtable RINGS again, begins to penetrate the sotted sleep \n               of the man. Two bottles of booze, one empty, and a clump of \n               glasses are on the coffee table in front of Bock. He grunts, \n               opens an eye. PHONE RINGS. Bock suddenly exsufflates in a \n               snorting grunt. He stands, shuffles to the bed, a big, sodden \n               fellow, picks up the receiver, interrupting its next RING. \n               He sinks, sitting on the bed.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         This is Dr. Bock... Yes, Mrs. \n                         Christie, what is it? It's all right, \n                         I'd be getting up in a few minutes \n                         anyway... I'm sorry I missed that. \n                         Would you say it again? Yes, I know \n                         him, Schaefer, the stud with the \n                         glasses, who fancies the nurses... \n                         I'm afraid I don't understand that, \n                         what do you mean? Was he sick? I \n                         mean, was he... uh, what was the \n                         cause of death? Was he being treated? \n                         I don't understand. What was he doing \n                         in the bed? You did say he... Look, \n                         Mrs. Christie, did you call the \n                         office? Good, well, I'll... No, no, \n                         it's all right. I'll be getting my \n                         wake-up call any minute anyway.\n\n               He returns the receiver to its cradle, sits disoriented, \n               unbuttoning his shirt.\n\n               HOSPITAL.

HEAL THE POOR!\" Two protesters move toward \n               the street, waving and yelling at an approaching car. One, a \n               young white fellow wears a sandwich board that goes into the \n               matter at some length: \"WE PROTEST THE EVICTION OF 386 BLACK \n               FAMILIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMES TO SERVE THE \n               EXPANSIONIST POLICIES OF THIS IMPERIALIST HOSPITAL.\"\n\n               In the back seat of the car sits JOHN SUNDSTROM, handsomely \n               graying, tanned, early fifties, the Director of the Hospital. \n               He looks up.

MILTON \n               MEAD, the Administrator of the Hospital, comes out of one of \n               the offices, waves a good morning to Bock, who acknowledges \n               him and plods on. Mead comes up to Sundstrom, now moving \n               toward his own office.\n\n                                     MILTON MEAD\n                         Sid just called from St. Luke's, and \n                         he's heard that the demonstrators up \n                         there are planning a march to join \n                         the bunch down here.\n\n                                     SUNDSTROM\n                         Oh, God.\n                              (he wraps his arm \n                              around Mead's \n                              shoulders, ushering \n                              him into his office \n                              area)\n                         Did you call the cops?\n\n                                     MILTON MEAD\n                         Yes.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR. 8:15 A.M.\n\n               The elevator door opens. Out comes Bock, overcoat unbuttoned \n               now. He clumps to the Nurses' Station. An unusual number of \n               nurses seems to be there. Through the doorway of the floor \n               pharmacy, we can see Nurse Rivers of the night shift being \n               comforted by Nurse Perez of the night shift and Nurse Edwards \n               of the morning shift. The head morning nurse, MRS. DONOVAN, \n               is at the desk hunched over her paperwork. (Nurses are always \n               hunched over their paperwork.) NURSE FELICIA CHILE is also \n               seated at the desk doing some paperwork. Head Nurse Donovan \n               looks up briefly as Dr. Bock approaches.\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                              (back to her paperwork)\n                         They're all in Eight-O-Six, Doctor.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                         I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie \n                         tell you about it.\n\n               Bock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of \n               activity. Kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts, \n               nurse's aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing \n               trays and used dishes. A robed patient or two ambulates along \n               the hall. Morning rounds have just started, which means a \n               clump of white-jacketed, white-trousered young doctors are \n               gathered in a gaggle at the far end. The group includes senior \n               resident MONROE BRUBAKER, junior resident HARVEY BIEGELMAN, \n               interns SAM CHANDLER and IRVING AMBLER and another medical \n               student, all lounging outside a door discussing the condition \n               of the patient within.\n\n               Chandler is presenting the case from a handful of notecards \n               in his hand. The others lean against the walls, listening. \n               They wear shirts and ties with the exception of Ambler, who \n               is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic \n               under his jacket. They are all in their twenties and have \n               swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches. When he spots \n               Dr. Bock, senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds over to \n               Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806.\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                              (as he approaches, \n                              rolls his eyes)\n                         Oh boy.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         I've seen some pretty good snafus, \n                         but this one... I mean, there's a \n                         certain splendor to this one. One of \n                         the night nurses, a float, thought \n                         Schaefer was a patient and plugged \n                         an I.V. into him. He was a diabetic, \n                         you know.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         What do you mean, a nurse plugged an \n                         I.V. into him?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Oh, it's really a screwed-up story, \n                         Doctor. You see, what happened was \n                         we had an old man in that bed who \n                         died last night, so the bed was \n                         available. And you know Schaefer. \n                         He's Sammy Stud.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         And he talked a nurse into zapping \n                         him on that bed.\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         I think it was a girl from hematology \n                         he's been running with.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         My God, it's a Roman farce.\n\n               The door to Room 806 opens, and an Assistant Administrator \n               named HITCHCOCK pokes his head out.\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         I thought I heard you out here, \n                         Doctor.\n                              (he too rolls his \n                              eyes heavenward in \n                              an expression of \n                              incredulity)\n\n               Bock makes a noise and goes into...\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               Aside from Hitchcock, the room includes MRS. CHRISTIE, the \n               Director of Nurses, a fusty forty-six, in streetclothes; \n               Head Night Nurse, Mrs. Reardon, in uniform; Head Evening \n               Nurse, MRS. DUNNE, mid-fifties, who had apparently been called \n               in from home because she's in mufti and wearing a winter \n               coat; and, of course, the comatose patient and the dead Dr. \n               Schaefer. Mrs. Christie is instructing the two nurses.\n\n                                     MRS. CHRISTIE\n                         I'll need one from both of you, three \n                         copies, and I suggest you do that \n                         right now. The forms are in my \n                         office...\n\n               Mrs. Dunne, on the verge of tears, head bobbing, looks up to \n               Bock.\n\n                                     MRS. DUNNE\n                         I'm really so terribly sorry about \n                         this, Dr. Bock.

Oh God, what a \n                         mess.\n\n               They all file out now, Bock in the rear into...\n\n               HALLWAY, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA\n\n               They all go along to the Nurses' Station where Mrs. Reardon \n               and Mrs. Dunne disappear into the rooms behind. Mrs. Christie \n               leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the TV-solarium; \n               but Dr. Brubaker is now holding his rounds there. He stands, \n               quietly expounding on the uses of heparin, a decoagulant. \n               One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to \n               injudicious use of that drug. Listening, the other young \n               doctors make notes. Mrs. Christie leans against the wall. \n               Apparently, the conference is to take place in the corridor. \n               Background activity continues normally.\n\n                                     MRS. CHRISTIE\n                              (with a sigh)\n                         Well, these things happen, of course.\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         I suppose I'd better call the Medical \n                         Examiner.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         I still don't know what happened.\n\n                                     MRS. CHRISTIE\n                         Well, it took an hour to get it sorted \n                         out. It seems a patient named Guernsey \n                         died last night in Eight-O-Six, but \n                         that information wasn't given to the \n                         night nurses. These things happen.\n\n               Bock has begun to get the drift. A curious state of apathy \n               settles over him.\n\n                                     MRS. CHRISTIE\n                              (rattling on)\n                         At any rate, according to the cardex, \n                         the patient Guernsey was down for \n                         twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-\n                         6-H, so Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez \n                         to give him his twelve o'clock shot. \n                         Meanwhile, it seems Dr. Schaefer had \n                         usurped that particular bed for his \n                         own purposes. Dr. Brubaker suggests \n                         it was for a love tryst, and some \n                         weight is given that hypothesis by \n                         the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (trying to give his \n                              attention to this)\n                         I get the drift, Mrs. Christie. In \n                         other words, Nurse Perez went in and \n                         sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was \n                         the patient Guernsey. My God! What I \n                         don't understand...\n\n                                     MRS. CHRISTIE\n                         If I may finish, Doctor. Well, after \n                         Perez gave him his shot, she noticed \n                         the I.V. on the bed had been pinched \n                         off, and she reported that back to \n                         Mrs. Reardon, who then assigned Nurse \n                         Rivers to restart the I.V.\n                              (Bock sighs)\n                         Now Rivers was a float. She didn't \n                         even know the staff people on the \n                         floor, and nobody knew what the \n                         patient Guernsey looked like anyway, \n                         since he'd only been admitted that \n                         morning.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         So she plugged an I.V. into him.\n\n                                     MRS.

This is the Department of Medicine, \n               where Bock and all the senior staff members of the department \n               have their offices. It's quiet, since most of the staff are \n               away at their various specialties about the hospital.\n\n               Bock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he \n               arrived in some hours ago. He has only managed to unbutton \n               it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner \n               office. Gilt lettering on the door reads: DEPARTMENT OF \n               MEDICINE and below that DR. HERBERT E. BOCK.\n\n               BOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE\n\n               Small office with two desks. As Department Chief, Bock gets \n               two secretaries. Both are at their desks, one on the phone, \n               MISS GLORIA LEBOW, and the other rattling away on the IBM, \n               MISS STEPHANIE McGUIRE.\n\n                                     MISS LEBOW\n                              (mouthing)\n                         Coffee?\n\n               It would seem not. Bock waves a listless hand, exits into...\n\n               BOCK'S PRIVATE OFFICE\n\n               The modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes. \n               Bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the \n               closet. In shirtsleeves with his tie a bit askew -- \n               fastidiousness in dress is not Bock's strong point -- he \n               crosses to his desk and sits, breathing more heavily than \n               his small exertions would seem to warrant. He seems exhausted. \n               There is a KNOCK on the door. Miss Lebow enters, holding a \n               filing envelope stuffed with papers.\n\n                                     MISS LEBOW\n                         A few things have been piling up. \n                         Would you like to go into them?\n\n               A guttural noise indicates yes. Miss Lebow pulls up a chair, \n               opens her folder.\n\n                                     MISS LEBOW\n                         A quickie. Dr. Esterhazy wants to \n                         start hiring temporary people to \n                         cover the summer vacations. He says \n                         last year some of the replacement \n                         people didn't receive their checks \n                         until they waited six months. He \n                         wonders if you could do something \n                         about getting these people paid more \n                         promptly.\n\n               She places a sheet of paper on the desk in front of Bock. He \n               tries to give his attention to it.\n\n                                     MISS LEBOW\n                              (drones on)\n                         Miss Aronovici complains the lab \n                         reports are coming in slow into the \n                         E.R.

All I have to do is pull \n                         myself together and get back into my \n                         work. I'm sorry I troubled you. Take \n                         care of yourself. I'll see you.\n\n               Before Einhorn can say a word, he slips away and disappears \n               into his own office.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION. 8:30 A.M.\n\n               The score of protesters outside the pavilion still move in \n               an uneven ellipse and shout: \"Two -- Four! Help the Poor!\" \n               Ives, the bespectacled demonstrator who shouted at Sundstrom \n               earlier, is removing his sandwich boards and giving them to \n               his replacement. He hurries across the walk and into...\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, LOBBY\n\n               Ives cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly \n               up the long corridor leading to the Farkis Building, \n               unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into...\n\n               THE FARKIS BUILDING, FIFTH FLOOR\n\n               ...and comes out, as the elevator opens. This is a laboratory \n               floor, and the corridors are empty except for a white-\n               uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young \n               woman in a white smock in the background, who waves to the \n               young man before disappearing into one of the rooms. Ives \n               fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own \n               lab. He enters into...\n\n               FARKIS BUILDING, NEPHROLOGY LAB\n\n               Dingy and cheerless place, as labs go. Ives hangs his coat \n               in the cupboard, loosens his tie, unbuttons his suit jacket, \n               squats on a stool, reaches over for a loose file on the work \n               table, opens the file and begins to read the papers inside.\n\n               A door CLICKS open behind him, and without looking up, he \n               waves briefly to whoever has entered. CAMERA DOLLIES to FULL \n               SHOT of Ives frowning over his notes. We are suddenly \n               conscious of a white-uniformed presence behind him. We know \n               it's medical personnel, but we can't see the face. Ives starts \n               to turn to the presence behind him, when suddenly a small \n               hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head, and he slumps \n               forward, his forehead thumping against the black surface of \n               the lab table.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               HOSPITAL. NOON\n\n               HIGH ANGLE SHOT establishing the passing of hours. Sun high \n               overhead, traffic on First Avenue an impenetrable river of \n               HONKS and HOOTS. At a crosswalk, a loose procession of fifty \n               or so shouting demonstrators, bearing placards, flows toward \n               the main gates. Their posters read: \"FIGHT DOPE -- NOT DOPES!\" \n               \"DRUGS YES! TRANSPLANTS NO!\" and \"SAVE OUR KIDS FROM THE \n               SKIDS!\" which is what they now chant: \"Save our kids! From \n               the Skids!\" The demonstration moves through a handful of \n               city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble \n               around, chanting: \"Two -- Four! Help the Poor!\"\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR\n\n               The staff elevator doors open and Bock comes out, wearing \n               his long white doctor's coat unbuttoned. Hanging about the \n               Nurses' Station are Dr. Brubaker and a few young men in white. \n               They come quickly to respectful attention at Bock's entrance. \n               CLATTERING TRAYS dominate the lunchtime atmosphere.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         All set?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               The doctors move off toward the solarium on the east corridor \n               overlooking the river. They pass a curious quartet of people \n               consisting of a very handsome YOUNG WOMAN in her late twenties \n               in an out-of-fashion miniskirt (She has great legs, long and \n               tanned.); an ELDERLY MAN, uncomfortable in city clothes and \n               unmistakably an INDIAN; a tall overcoated man in his forties \n               wearing a MINISTER's white collar; and a DISTINGUISHED MAN \n               dressed in fashionable gray who is trying to persuade the \n               young woman of something. The young woman and the Indian \n               stand absolutely still, silent, impassive. The minister is \n               more fidgety.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (to Brubaker en passant)\n                         Who's that exotic group?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                              (murmurs)\n                         You got me.

A hell of a case.\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR, TV ROOM\n\n               Some twenty-five or thirty young doctors, two or three of \n               them black, three or four of them women, fill the room. At \n               Bock's entrance, they find places around the walls, sofas, \n               soft chairs and benches. The TV set has been pushed into a \n               corner, and a large portable blackboard has been set up. \n               This is the Chief of Service Round, attended by every \n               available intern and resident. Somebody closes the door, \n               just as two young doctors come hurrying in.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         All right, who's presenting?\n\n               EMERGENCY AREA, WAITING ROOM\n\n               People of all ages sit around on aluminum chairs arranged \n               around the walls of the room. All are in streetclothes. Some \n               speak to each other. A line of people, extending into the \n               hallway and holding their charts, waits for a lady from the \n               accounting department taking Blue Cross numbers. This lady \n               from accounting is MRS. CUSHING, late forties, bespectacled \n               and testy. She calls out at large.\n\n                                     MRS.

Behind the desk are a supply room and another \n               treatment room. Both are occupied, the former by a PARANOID \n               LADY wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to \n               by a very patient young intern.\n\n                                     PARANOID LADY\n                         They follow me everywhere.

They're \n                         waiting out there for me now...\n\n               ...and in the other room, a man in his thirties is being \n               treated for some sort of head lacerations. In one treatment \n               room, the Chief of Emergency Service, DR. SPEZIO, a man in \n               his late thirties, along with an intern, an anesthesiologist \n               and a nurse, is bent over a naked and comatose young black \n               woman of eighteen, covered somewhat with a sheet. She's a \n               junkie, being intubated, i.e. a small endotracheal tube has \n               been inserted into her mouth. This is the most melodramatic \n               of the varied activity here.\n\n               A middle-aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed \n               in another treatment room; a nurse attends him.\n\n               An asthmatic middle-aged woman sits in still another room \n               being administered her 500 mg. of amenophylene subcutaneously.\n\n               The curtains on another room are drawn for privacy. On chairs \n               in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle \n               and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held \n               in his lap.\n\n               A young mother with a five-year-old daughter with a badly \n               cut arm is being attended to by the back wall.

He moves around in front of the blackboard, chalk \n               in hand. The blackboard itself is scrawled with formulae and \n               diagrams. He is writing the words \"full abdomen,\" as the \n               fifth in a list reading \"(1) parexia, (2) hepatomegaly, (3) \n               splenomegaly, (4) episodes of arthralgia.\" The audience is \n               forty young doctors rapt with attention.

He conned Biegelman with \n                         that old story about...\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         ...protein in the urine?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         And he biopsied the man?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         And he nicked a vessel, and at two \n                         o'clock in the morning, they woke up \n                         Biegelman because the nurse found \n                         the patient in shock. Biegelman called \n                         the kidney people for a consult right \n                         away. What was there to see? The man \n                         was sour and bleeding. We spoke to \n                         this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred \n                         us to a surgeon named Welbeck...\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Welbeck?!

So we \n                         finally got Welbeck around four in \n                         the morning. He said, go ahead. So \n                         they laid on the surgery for eight. \n                         Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders \n                         an I.V.P., clears him for allergies...\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         ...without actually testing.\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Right.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         And the patient went into shock...\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         ...and tubular necrosis. They lopped \n                         out the bleeding kidney, ran him \n                         back to the room, and we sat around \n                         waiting for three days to see how \n                         obstructed he was. Fever began spiking \n                         like hell, euremia, vomiting, so we \n                         arranged hemodialysis. He's putting \n                         out good water now. But some nurse \n                         goofed on his last treatment. A leak \n                         in the tube, something. His blood \n                         pressure plunged. They ran him right \n                         up to I.C.U., checked out vital signs, \n                         all normal except he's comatose. \n                         That was two days ago.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         In short, a man came into this \n                         hospital in perfectly good health, \n                         and, in the space of one week, we \n                         chopped out one kidney, damaged the \n                         other, reduced him to coma and damn \n                         near killed him.\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               A great sad serenity has settled over Bock.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You know, Brubaker, last night I sat \n                         in my hotel room, reviewing the \n                         shambles of my life and contemplating \n                         suicide. Then I said \"No, Bock, don't \n                         do it. You're a doctor, a healer. \n                         You're the Chief of Medicine at one \n                         of the great hospitals of the world. \n                         You're a necessary person. Your life \n                         is meaningful.\" Then I came in this \n                         morning and find out one of my doctors \n                         was killed by a couple of nurses who \n                         mistook him for a patient because he \n                         screwed a technician from the \n                         nephrology lab...\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Hematology, sir.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         And now you come to me with this \n                         gothic horror story in which the \n                         entire machinery of modern medicine \n                         has apparently conspired to destroy \n                         one lousy patient. How am I to sustain \n                         my feeling of meaningfulness in the \n                         face of this? You know, Brubaker, if \n                         there was an oven around, I'd stick \n                         my head in it. What was the name of \n                         that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion \n                         again?\n\n                                     BRUBAKER\n                         Ives, sir.

Out \n               of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working \n               around him and Brubaker, he keeps it glacial. But there is \n               no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (barely containing \n                              himself)\n                         I'm going to ream his ass. And I'm \n                         going to break that barber Welbeck's \n                         back. I'm going to defrock those two \n                         cannibals.

Before we kill him.\n\n               The elevator door opens. A couple of nurses come out. Bock \n               strides in.\n\n               SEVENTH FLOOR, DEPT.

BREWSTER, the Resident in Pathology, dressed \n               in surgical scrub.\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         ...and the next thing anybody knew, \n                         about three hours later, Mrs. Cushing \n                         from Accounting came in and said \n                         there was a dead man in the Holding \n                         Room.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You don't find anything grotesque \n                         about all this?\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         What do you mean?\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         I mean, at half past eight this \n                         morning, we meet over a doctor who's \n                         been killed intravenously, and here \n                         we are again, four hours later, with \n                         another doctor who had a heart attack \n                         in the Emergency Room.\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         Well, what're you suggesting Doctor? \n                         Do you think we have a mad killer \n                         stalking the halls of the hospital? \n                         Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart \n                         attack and Schaefer in a diabetic \n                         coma. People do die of these things. \n                         It's all perhaps coincidental, but I \n                         don't think I'd call it grotesque.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         How long are they going to be on \n                         Schaefer's post?\n\n               He knocks on the glass window of the door separating the \n               laboratory from the operating room. Dr. Brewster turns from \n               his gory chore. Bock makes a gesture saying, \"How much \n               longer?\" Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-gloved \n               fingers. Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door \n               out.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (pauses at door, to \n                              Lagerman)\n                         I don't suppose you'd like to call \n                         next of kin?\n\n                                     DR.

NIGHT\n\n               CRASH of THUNDER. CRACKLE of LIGHTNING. A horror-film \n               rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings.\n\n               SEVENTH FLOOR, DEPT. OF MEDICINE CORRIDOR\n\n               Dark, empty, silent. One lonely light at the lobby end of \n               the long, closed corridor of offices. The door to Bock's \n               office stands ajar and issues a trace of light.\n\n               BOCK'S OFFICE\n\n               ACROSS the silent, dark, typewriter-covered desks of the two \n               secretaries through the doorway to Bock's private office, we \n               can see Bock at his desk, lit by the desk lamp. He has a \n               bottle of booze on his desk. He gets up from his desk. He \n               has made a decision.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR\n\n               The corridors are silent; the night lights are on, subdued. \n               Head Evening Nurse Mrs. Dunne is back at her desk, hunched \n               over paperwork. Resident Brubaker passes by.\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR, PHARMACY\n\n               Nurse SHERLEE DEVINE, a black woman in her mid-twenties, has \n               a porcelain tray on the shelf onto which she puts a small \n               jar of alcohol, cotton swabs, a wrapped hypodermic needle \n               and syringe. She moves out into...\n\n               NURSES' STATION\n\n               ...where Mrs. Dunne looks up as she passes.\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                         Mead.\n\n               Mrs. Dunne nods. Nurse Devine makes her way silently down \n               the sleeping doors to...\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               Dark, sleeping. The bathroom light is on, but only a thin \n               stream of yellow light trickles through the door. THUNDER \n               CRASHES. William Mead sleeps fitfully. The other patient is \n               entirely curtained off. Nurse Devine sets her tray on Mead's \n               bedtable, turns on the goose-neck lamp, keeping it from his \n               eyes. She unwraps the hypodermic syringe, sets in the needle, \n               draws the required dosage, reaches over and gently shakes \n               Mead by the shoulder.\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                              (softly)\n                         Mr. Mead... Mr. Mead, I have an \n                         injection for you.\n\n               Mead sleeps on. Expressionlessly, Nurse Devine extracts Mead's \n               right arm from under the sheets, wets a swab with alcohol \n               and rubs down the vein. The needle slides into Mead's vein. \n               OVER THIS, we begin to hear a distant sibilant HISSING, \n               indistinct like the leakage of a bad heart. There is also an \n               occasional distinctly human but not quite civilized sound.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to Nurse Devine withdrawing the \n               needle, looking up, for she too has heard the soft, strange \n               sounds. They emanate from behind the curtains of the other \n               bed. Nurse Devine returns the syringe to the tray, gathers \n               her things and pads silently around Mead's bed to Drummond's \n               bed. With her free hand, she opens the curtains a little and \n               stares in.\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                         What the hell is going on in there?\n\n               NURSE DEVINE'S P.O.V.: THE INDIAN AND BARBARA DRUMMOND BEND \n               OVER DRUMMOND PERFORMING SOME PAGAN RITUAL. THE HISSING IS \n               BARBARA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE CEREMONY. (IT SOUNDS LIKE PIS-\n               PIS, AND IS IN FACT AN IMITATION OF THE NIGHTHAWK, MEANT TO \n               APPEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE THUNDER.)\n\n               The old Indian has stripped to the waist and marked his body \n               with smears of dye and tule pollen. He wears a ceremonial \n               hat, a sort of beaded beanie. He holds a small buckskin bag \n               of pollen in his cupped palms and is facing north, east, \n               south and west, offering the bag and prayers under his breath \n               as he does. A beaded amulet lies stretched across the white \n               sheet covering the comatose Drummond.\n\n               When Nurse Devine draws the curtains, Barbara frowns at Nurse \n               Devine, holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws the \n               curtains closed again. Nurse Devine, carrying her porcelain \n               tray, exits.\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION\n\n               Bock comes out of the elevator, jacketed now, fairly drunk \n               but holding it well.\n\n               He heads for the Nurses' Station as Nurse Devine comes down \n               the west corridor. Bock grunts at Mrs. Dunne and goes into...\n\n               PHARMACY\n\n               ...where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf \n               until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches \n               off the shelf and slips into his pocket. He rummages through \n               the drawers for a hypodermic syringe. Through the open \n               doorway, we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up to \n               Mrs. Dunne at the desk.\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                         Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor \n                         in Eight-O-Six, and you better go in \n                         there. You know that Indian that was \n                         sitting in Eight-O-Six all night? \n                         He's still there, and the girl's \n                         there, and they're doing some voodoo \n                         in there, and I ain't kidding.\n\n               Behind Mrs. Dunne, Bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy \n               where he stands listening.\n\n                                     MRS. DUNNE\n                              (looking up)\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                         I mean that Indian's in there, half-\n                         naked and going pis-pis-pis with a \n                         little bag. You just better get in \n                         there, Mrs. Dunne.\n\n               Mrs. Dunne, annoyed, gets up and heads for the west corridor, \n               followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr. Bock at a \n               few paces behind.\n\n                                     NURSE DEVINE\n                              (to NURSE WEITZENBAUM, \n                              coming out of another \n                              room)\n                         You want to see somethin', baby? You \n                         jus' come here.\n\n               As the small procession bears down, Barbara Drummond slips \n               out of that room to intercept them.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (keeping her voice \n                              low)\n                         Look, it's a perfectly harmless \n                         ceremony, nothing to get excited \n                         about. It'll be over in a few minutes \n                         anyway. Mr. Blacktree is a shaman \n                         who gets his power from the thunder, \n                         and it's imperative he conclude his \n                         rituals while the storm is still \n                         going on.\n\n                                     NURSE DUNNE\n                         Visiting hours were over at nine \n                         o'clock, Miss.\n\n               Bock reaches for the door to the room.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         All that's going on in there, Doctor, \n                         is a simple Apache prayer for my \n                         father's recovery.\n\n               Bock makes a vague noise, neither contradicting her nor \n               assenting, and continues around her into...\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               As Bock slides in, a bit of the corridor light comes in with \n               him. The curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal \n               Mr. Blacktree. He is still stripped to the waist and marked \n               with crosses of pollen. He extends two twigs to the four \n               directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the \n               white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the amulet \n               already there. Behind Bock, Mrs. Dunne can be seen peeking \n               in. The Indian is oblivious to both of them. Bock watches it \n               all with interest for a moment and then backs out into...\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\n               ...closing the door after him.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         The markings he's made on my father's \n                         arms are from the pollen of the tule \n                         plant. The twigs have no significance \n                         other than they've been struck by \n                         lightning and are consequently appeals \n                         to the spirit of lightning. It's all \n                         entirely harmless, a religious \n                         ceremony, not a medical one.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You don't seriously believe all that \n                         mumbo-jumbo will cure him?\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         On the other hand, it won't kill \n                         him, Doctor.\n\n               They regard each other levelly.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (grunts)\n                         Okay.

Barbara edges past Weitzenbaum, who is still \n               peeking into the room.\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               Barbara comes in, gathers her coat and purse from a chair \n               and moves to the Indian, now occupied with what seems to be \n               the rolling of a cigarette. The two exchange a brief dialogue \n               in Apache. The old Indian nods. Barbara turns and exits, \n               taking Nurse Weitzenbaum out with her and closing the door. \n               The room is dark and hushed again. Blacktree lights his \n               cigarette and \"sends the smoke up,\" a ritual which consists \n               of puffing smoke to each of the four directions, muttering \n               in Apache \"May all be well\" after each puff.\n\n               CAMERA SLOWLY PANS to the other bed where William Mead sleeps \n               fitfully. The Apache words and pis-pis-pis penetrate Mead's \n               drugged sleep. He opens one eyelid and stares glazedly at \n               the dark air. The SOUNDS persist. Blacktree chooses this \n               moment to sidle out from behind the curtains and continue \n               his ritual in the less-confined space at the head of \n               Drummond's bed. It's quite a sight for a nervous, sedated \n               man to wake to.  Thunder RUMBLES and the rain SLASHES and a \n               sudden, savage STREAK of lightning illuminates it all.\n\n               Mead figures it's all a bad dream and, after a moment of \n               dully regarding the odd spectacle, closes his one eye and \n               goes back to sleep.\n\n               BOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE\n\n               Barbara Drummond comes in. Bock has apparently turned the \n               lights on for her, but Bock himself is not immediately \n               visible. She looks through the half-open door to Bock's \n               private office, and there he is, staring blankly at the \n               bottle. Barbara starts to say something, thinks better of \n               it, lays down her coat, and looking around, spots a Manhattan \n               classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf and \n               sets on Miss Lebow's desk. She sits, quickly flips through \n               the pages.\n\n               Barbara flips through the directory. Bock is partially visible \n               in the background at his desk. He sits soddenly. Barbara \n               finds what she wants, opens her purse and takes out two \n               airplane tickets. She dials. The CLICKING of the dial catches \n               Bock's ear. He looks up for a moment.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (on phone)\n                         Hello.

Thank you...\n\n               REVERSE ACROSS Bock at his desk with Barbara partially visible \n               at Miss Lebow's desk. All he can see are her great long tanned \n               legs.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (in background on \n                              phone)\n                         ...Drummond, first name, Barbara. \n                         I'll pay cash...\n\n               Bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his desk to \n               get a better look at those legs.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (on phone)\n                         No, you're to pick up my father, \n                         Drummond, Edward, at the Manhattan \n                         Medical Center, Holly Pavilion, Room \n                         Eight-O-Six. It's a stretcher case. \n                         I presume you provide the stretcher.\n\n               She senses Bock watching her, turns, smiles. She's a very \n               beautiful girl. She returns to the phone.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         He's to be taken to American Airlines, \n                         Yes... No...

Yes, \n                         thank you.\n\n               She returns the receiver to its cradle. When she looks up \n               again, Bock is no longer there. She returns the flight tickets \n               to her purse, snaps it shut, stands and moves to the doorway, \n               enters a step into...\n\n               BOCK'S OFFICE\n\n               Bock, back at his desk, looks up.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You believe in witchcraft, Miss \n                         Drummond?\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         I believe in everything, Doctor.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Like a drink?\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         Yes.\n\n               Bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of bourbon.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (from the door suddenly)\n                         My father, you should know, was a \n                         very successful doctor in Boston, a \n                         member of the Harvard Medical Faculty. \n                         He was a widower, and I was his only \n                         child. He was not an especially \n                         religious man, a sober Methodist. \n                         One evening, seven years ago, he \n                         attended a Pentecostal meeting in \n                         the commons rooms at Harvard and \n                         suddenly found himself speaking in \n                         tongues.\n                              (she takes her drink \n                              and crosses to the \n                              sofa)\n                         That is to say, he suddenly sank to \n                         his knees at the back of the room \n                         and began to talk fluently in a \n                         language which no one had ever heard \n                         before. This sort of thing happens \n                         frequently at Pentecostal meetings, \n                         and they began to happen regularly \n                         to my father.\n                              (she sits)\n                         It was not unusual to walk into our \n                         home and find my father sitting in \n                         his office, utterly serene and happily \n                         speaking to the air in this strange \n                         foreign tongue. I was, at that time \n                         twenty years old and having my \n                         obligatory affair with a minority \n                         group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a \n                         post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing \n                         his doctorate in the aboriginal \n                         languages of the Southwest. One day, \n                         I brought the Indian boy home just \n                         as my father was sinking to his knees \n                         in the entrance foyer in one of his \n                         trances. The Indian wheeled in his \n                         tracks and said, \"Well, I'll be a \n                         sonofabitch.\" You see, my father was \n                         speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure \n                         dialect at that, spoken only by a \n                         ragged band of unreconstructed Indians \n                         who had rejected the reservation and \n                         were living in total isolation in \n                         the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern \n                         Mexico.

I had \n                         achieved a few minor sensory \n                         deformities, some suicidal despairs, \n                         but nothing as wild as fluency in an \n                         obscure Apache dialect. I mean, like \n                         wow, man! I mean, here was living \n                         afflatus right before my eyes! Within \n                         a week, my father had closed his \n                         Beacon Hill practice and set out to \n                         start a mission in the Mexican \n                         mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S. \n                         card and my crash helmet and followed \n                         him. It was a disaster, at least for \n                         me. My father had received the \n                         revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on \n                         a mountain slope and preached the \n                         apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians. \n                         I masturbated a great deal. We lived \n                         in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit \n                         and crushed pi\u00f1on nuts. It was \n                         hideous. Within two months, I was \n                         back in Boston, a hollow shell and \n                         dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with \n                         everything. I turned to austerity, \n                         combed my hair tight and entered \n                         nursing school. I became haggard, \n                         driven and had shamelessly incestuous \n                         dreams about my father. I took up \n                         with some of the senior staff at the \n                         hospital. One of them, a portly \n                         psychiatrist, explained I was \n                         generated by an unresolved lust for \n                         my father. I apparently cracked up. \n                         One day, they found me walking to \n                         work naked and screaming obscenities. \n                         There was talk of institutionalizing \n                         me, so I packed a bag and went back \n                         to my father in the Sierra Madre \n                         Mountains. I've been there ever since. \n                         That's three years. My father is, of \n                         course, mad as a hatter. I watch \n                         over him and have been curiously \n                         content. You see, Doctor, I believe \n                         in everything.\n\n               She pauses, her story over. Throughout, Bock has been trying \n               to keep his glowering eye on the desktop. During her long \n               narrative, he once seized the bottle and took a swig. Mostly \n               he is finding the experience murkily sensual. His glance \n               keeps darting out from under his brows to surreptitiously \n               look at the beautiful long tanned legs; or, when she bends \n               for the drink she set on the floor, to peer down the flapping \n               open scalloped neck of her dress; she is bra-less.\n\n               She, on the other hand, has been crossing and uncrossing her \n               legs, bending, stretching, so that her short dress has ridden \n               up almost to her waist and is saved from utter exhibitionism \n               only by the darkness of the shadows. She seems unaffected by \n               Bock's voyeuristic interest in her, but she is surely not \n               unaware of it. It is hard to believe she is not courting his \n               attention.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Now what was that all about, Miss \n                         Drummond?\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         I thought I was obvious as hell.

The \n               dark, dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient \n               sexuality.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                              (looks down again)\n                         You're wasting your time.

My God, you kids are more \n                         hung up on sex than the Victorians! \n                         I've got a son, twenty-three. I threw \n                         him out of the house last year. \n                         Pietistic little humbug. He preached \n                         universal love and despised everyone. \n                         He had a blanket contempt for the \n                         middle class, even its decencies. He \n                         detested my mother because she had \n                         petit bourgeois pride in her son the \n                         doctor. I cannot tell you how \n                         brutishly he ignored that rather \n                         good old lady. When she died, he \n                         didn't even come to the funeral. He \n                         thought the chapel service an \n                         hypocrisy. His generation didn't \n                         live with lies, he told me. \"Everybody \n                         lives with lies,\" I said. I grabbed \n                         him by his poncho, dragged him the \n                         full length of our seven-room \n                         despicably affluent middle-class \n                         apartment and flung him out. I haven't \n                         seen him since. But do you know what \n                         he said to me as he stood there on \n                         that landing on the verge of tears. \n                         He shrieked at me: \"You old fink! \n                         You can't even get it up anymore!\" \n                         That was it, you see. That was his \n                         real revolution. It wasn't racism \n                         and the oppressed poor and the war \n                         in Vietnam. The ultimate American \n                         societal sickness was a limp dingus. \n                         Hah!\n                              (he lurches about, \n                              laughing rustily)\n                         My God, if there is a despised and \n                         misunderstood minority in this \n                         country, it's us poor impotent \n                         bastards.

Disagreeable as it may \n                         be for a woman, a man may sometimes \n                         lust for other things, something \n                         less transient than an erection, \n                         some sense of permanent worth. That's \n                         what medicine was for me, my reason \n                         for being. When I was thirty-four, \n                         Miss Drummond, I presented a paper \n                         before the annual convention of the \n                         Society of Clinical Investigation \n                         that pioneered the whole goddam field \n                         of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm \n                         in all the textbooks. I happen to be \n                         an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And \n                         you want to know something, Miss \n                         Drummond? I don't give a goddam. \n                         When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've \n                         lost even my desire for work, which \n                         is a hell of a lot more primal a \n                         passion than sex. I've lost my raison \n                         d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I \n                         ever truly loved. It's all rubbish \n                         anyway.

We have assembled the most \n                         enormous medical establishment ever \n                         conceived, and people are sicker \n                         than ever!

That's what I mean when I \n                         say impotent!

They look to the door where Mr. Blacktree, fully clothed \n               again and carrying his coat, is standing in the doorway. \n               Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (crossing to the door)\n                         Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my \n                         miniskirt, but it was the only thing \n                         I had to come to the city with.

In the subsequent hush, thunder \n               RUMBLES and CRASHES. Wind sweeps the rain against the window \n               panes.\n\n               The sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble. Slowly, he \n               raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket \n               pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe. He \n               takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking \n               about for the vein. He removes his trouser belt, which he \n               ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet. Now, he \n               tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it. \n               Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally finds \n               a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He lights one and returns to \n               the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly as \n               he does. Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES. He carefully draws \n               just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the \n               syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of his \n               desk lamp. He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches \n               the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigidly \n               out under the light of the lamp...\n\n                                     BARBARA'S VOICE\n                              (off-screen)\n                         What're you shooting, Doc?\n\n               He turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still \n               rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenched \n               in his other hand. Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway. \n               He stares at her, slowly suffusing with the numb, blind, \n               total rage of the aborted suicide.

Then slowly over Bock's plunging shoulder to the \n               woman's face. She gasps at the moment of penetration, then \n               her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity. Bock \n               sobs; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears \n               on his cheek.\n\n               ABRUPT SILENCE.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL, NIGHT. 4:00 A.M.\n\n               The quiet, black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of \n               lamplight.\n\n               THE STEINMETZ PAVILION, TENTH FLOOR\n\n               The night shift is finishing up.

To \n               the room:\n\n                                     CAMPANELLA\n                         Well, I'll see you.\n\n               TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR. NIGHT\n\n               Campanella comes out of the Dialysis room, puts on her coat \n               and walks to...\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION LOBBY. NIGHT\n\n               Campanella moves down the empty corridor. All the doors are \n               closed now; only the overhead light in the background of the \n               corridor glows weakly. Campanella puts a cigarette in her \n               mouth, pauses to look for matches; she hasn't any. Scowling \n               with annoyance, she continues to the lobby and stops by a \n               partially visible white-jacketed figure reading a newspaper.\n\n                                     CAMPANELLA\n                         Do you have a match, Doctor?\n\n               She takes the matches, lights her cigarette, inhaling deeply, \n               when he suddenly sandbags her from behind. She goes down.\n\n               BOCK'S OFFICE. DAYBREAK, WEDNESDAY\n\n               Covered by Bock's overcoat, Barbara tosses and turns on the \n               couch in a small nightmare. Through the windows comes the \n               first gray wash of dawn. FULL SHOT of Barbara, awake and up \n               on one elbow on the verge of a scream. She looks around the \n               room. It is dark, empty, silent.\n\n               ACROSS Barbara looking through the door to the secretarial \n               office. It is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on \n               and, a moment later, Bock enters. He holds a container of \n               coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his \n               forearm. From under Bock's bulky coat, Barbara watches him \n               lumber to his desk, where he sets the containers of coffee \n               down. He drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair \n               and then sits. He hoists a bulging folder of correspondence \n               from his filing tray and hunches to work, reading. After a \n               moment, he regards the silent figure on the couch across the \n               room.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You wouldn't be awake.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         What time is it?\n\n               He rises, picks up the second container and white dress from \n               the chair. She reaches out an arm for the coffee. Bock holds \n               up -- a nurse's uniform.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         I swiped this for you out of the \n                         nurses' locker room.

He opens his eyes \n               to look at her drowsily.\n\n                                     WILLIAM MEAD\n                              (under sedation)\n                         You know, I hallucinated last night. \n                         I hallucinated there was an Indian \n                         doing a war dance in here.\n\n                                     NURSE CHILE\n                              (affably)\n                         You weren't hallucinating, Mr. Mead. \n                         There was an Indian in here last \n                         night.\n\n                                     WILLIAM MEAD\n                              (staring through his \n                              sedation at her)\n                         There was?\n\n               They wheel him out into...\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, SURGICAL AREA CORRIDOR\n\n               Mead is wheeled down the corridor by the orderly. At the far \n               end, an anesthetized patient, blue in the harsh light, fresh \n               from surgery, is being wheeled into a recovery room.\n\n               Surgery is busy and efficient but not as clinically tidy as \n               we'd like. Linens and equipment and surgical gear are piled \n               into corners or on empty stretchers. Green-uniformed nurses, \n               doctors and orderlies go in and out of the many doors flanking \n               the corridor. This is the non-sterilized area, where doctors \n               and nurses confer in the corridors; three black orderlies \n               await an assignment, sit on stretchers, chuckle, mutter. \n               Phones can be heard RINGING. The orderly wheeling Mead turns \n               left into the...\n\n               SURGICAL AREA, CENTRAL PLAZA\n\n               ...a small, cluttered central area with the office of the \n               Operating Room Nursing Supervisor on the right and the Holding \n               (for Anesthesia) Room on the left. The O.R. is like the \n               Emergency Ward, desperately busy but staffed by people grown \n               so accustomed to it that they display a calm, almost casual \n               but febrile efficiency. A large blackboard faces the \n               Supervisor's Office with the day's schedule of operations \n               neatly chalked in. It is full. A middle-aged surgeon, still \n               in his overcoat, is studying the schedule.\n\n               A green-uniformed NURSE swings through the glass doors from \n               the Operating Room area to lean into the Supervisor's Office.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         Dr. Norris says about half an hour.\n\n                                     SECOND NURSE\n                         Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian \n                         cyst.\n\n               The THIRD NURSE leans back into the Supervisor's Office to \n               relay this information.\n\n                                     THIRD NURSE\n                         Shirley, it was just an ovarian cyst!\n\n               This is apparently good news, for we hear someone saying\n\n                                     VOICE\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Oh, thank God.\n\n               An orderly rumbles by with an E.K.G. machine. O.R. Nursing \n               Supervisor DOROTHY KIMBALL, a pleasant lady in her late \n               thirties, leans out of her office to speak to one of the \n               lounging orderlies.\n\n                                     MRS.

It \n               is into this atmosphere of subdued febrility that William \n               Mead is wheeled.\n\n                                     ORDERLY\n                              (to Mrs. Kimball)\n                         William Mead from Holly Eight.\n\n                                     MRS.

As the orderly wheels \n               her past CAMERA, we may recognize the pale, sleeping profile \n               of Miss Campanella, the nurse who had been coshed with a \n               sandbag not many scenes ago. A CIRCULATING NURSE comes through \n               the glass doors, examines the chart dangling from the \n               stretcher.\n\n                                     MRS.

He goes back to...\n\n               OUTER CORRIDOR\n\n               ...Welbeck crosses, opens a door and enters...\n\n               SURGEONS' LOCKER ROOM\n\n               All four walls are lined with lockers.

Two surgeons, one middle-aged and the other a young \n               RESIDENT, are changing. The resident turns to Welbeck on his \n               entrance and says:\n\n                                     RESIDENT\n                         It's legal for a doctor to incorporate \n                         in New York, isn't it, Doctor?\n\n                                     WELBECK\n                              (en route to phone)\n                         Since last September.

But your \n                         corporation doesn't pay that tax, \n                         because we've eliminated the taxable \n                         income with the bonus.

The malpractice here is \n                         monumental. As you see, Dr. Schaefer's \n                         blood sugar was twenty-three. No \n                         glucose solution is going to do that. \n                         The only thing that will do that is \n                         at least fifty units of insulin, \n                         probably more. The only presumption \n                         is that one of those nurses on the \n                         Eighth Floor shot fifty units of \n                         insulin into Schaefer's blood stream, \n                         either by injection or through the \n                         I.V., although how in God's name...\n\n               Mrs. Christie's electric pocket-pager BEEPS.\n\n                                     MRS.

A patient \n                         named Mangafranni was scheduled for \n                         a hysterectomy at ten o'clock -- Dr. \n                         Mallory.

Three and peer over \n               each other's shoulders into the room where the operating \n               crew is hunched over the open-heart massage. The masked \n               circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, \n               and gives a hopeless shrug.\n\n                                     HITCHCOCK\n                         I better get Mr. Mead.\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, THE STAFF ROOM\n\n               Milton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a \n               lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives \n               half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously \n               expressed by:\n\n                                     LADY FROM WOMEN'S LIB\n                         ...abortion?

Dr. Chu, blessed \n               with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment \n               together, nods to Mrs. Christie.\n\n                                     DR.

He died yesterday \n                         of an overdose of insulin. What do \n                         they want Schaefer for?\n\n                                     LAGERMAN\n                         The Holding Room nurse says there \n                         was a Dr. Schaefer hanging around \n                         the Holding Room. It wouldn't have \n                         been your Schaefer anyway. The nurse \n                         says it was senior staff, a middle-\n                         aged man.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         There's no senior staff named Schaefer \n                         in this hospital.\n\n                                     LAGERMAN\n                         I told them that. I said, I don't \n                         know any senior staff around here \n                         named Schaefer. They've got detectives \n                         down there, everything. It's a whole \n                         big investigation.\n\n               The elevator stops at the seventh floor. The doors open and \n               Bock and Lagerman stroll into...\n\n               HOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR\n\n               Bock lumbers down the west corridor, turns into...\n\n               ROOM 806\n\n               William Mead, sedated and apparently zonked out cold, is \n               being transferred from a stretcher back into bed by an O.R. \n               orderly and nurse's aid. Bock rolls back the curtains around \n               Drummond's bed revealing the comatose patient, his face \n               sculptured against the white pillow, an I.V. tube in his \n               right arm, a catheter projecting from under the sheet. Bock \n               lowers the protective railing, leans in, takes the man's \n               pulse on his neck, raises one closed eyelid, then the other. \n               The pupils stare vacuously back at him; the eyelids drop \n               closed as soon as they are released.\n\n               In the background, the orderly and aid finish tucking in \n               William Mead and exit, wheeling their creaking stretcher \n               out. The room is shockingly silent. Bock goes to the window \n               and frowns in thought.\n\n               HOLD ACROSS the patient Drummond, on Bock in the background \n               at the window with his back to us. Suddenly, Drummond's eyes \n               open. He lies rigid, his eyes staring dementedly into the \n               air above him.\n\n               Slowly, his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws \n               the catheter from his bladder, lays it on the white sheet \n               beside him, and silently reaches over to withdraw the I.V. \n               needle from his right arm.

Schaefer was first, you \n                         see, because he killed God.

(FLASHBACK)\n\n               A cheerless, gray sunlight fills the room as the fragile, \n               white-haired and bearded old Guernsey (whose admittance to \n               the hospital was the opening scene of the film) is being \n               helped into the room by Nurse Felicia Chile. She solicitously \n               helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket and hat \n               which she puts in the armoire. With palsied fingers, the \n               little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons the \n               collar, which is three sizes too large. In the other bed, \n               Drummond's eyes slowly open.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         I was instantly aware of a divine \n                         presence.\n\n               The old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a thin \n               little body in a torn nightshirt.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         I was convinced this porcelain old \n                         man was, in fact, an Angel of the \n                         Lord...\n\n               The old man sits back, wheezing a little. Nurse Chile smiles \n               nicely at him and takes her leave. For a moment, Drummond \n               lies rigidly on his bed, staring dully into the air and the \n               old man sits with his hunched back to us. The room is silent \n               except for his rheumy wheeze.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         ...perhaps even Christ Himself.\n\n               After a moment, the old man rises and goes to the washbasin \n               and, with some wheezing, spits into it. He shuffles back to \n               bed. Dr. Schaefer comes into the room with a professional \n               smile and the patient Guernsey's chart.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Our Savior was, it seems, suffering \n                         from emphysema.\n\n               Schaefer perches on the bed beside Guernsey and begins to \n               take his history.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         He was relentlessly subjected to the \n                         benefits of modern medicine. He was \n                         misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and put \n                         into shock by Dr. Schaefer; raced \n                         off to Intensive Care, where the \n                         resident compounded the blunder and \n                         induced a coma. I can tell you with \n                         authority that God is indeed dead. \n                         He died last Monday under the name \n                         of Guernsey.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of Drummond in deep shadow shows him sleeping.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         A few hours later, he appeared to me \n                         in a revelation.\n\n               ROOM 806. NIGHT, 7:00 P.M.\n\n               The room is lit only by the yellow light from the half-opened \n               bathroom door. Guernsey walks out of the shadows, hands \n               raised. He shuffles to Drummond's bedside and looks down on \n               him from his frail height.\n\n                                     GUERNSEY\n                              (softly)\n                         Rise up, Drummond. You are dead, now \n                         you are restored.\n\n               Drummond's eyes open and roll to the direction of the voice.\n\n               DRUMMOND'S P.O.V.: Guernsey, dressed only in his hospital \n               shift, is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room, hands \n               clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European intellectual, \n               head hunched forward -- a little old man with a white beard \n               talking to himself.\n\n                                     GUERNSEY\n                         Those who killed you and those who \n                         killed me will die in our place. You \n                         are the Paraclete of Caborca, the \n                         wrath of the lamb. The angel of the \n                         bottomless pit.\n\n               Guernsey closes his eyes in religious ecstacy.\n\n                                     GUERNSEY\n                         In this fashion has it been revealed \n                         to you.\n\n               Drummond starts to sob and slowly sits up in his bed, imbued \n               with belief. He looks mutely up at the frail old man, who \n               now raises his right hand and his face is transfigured into \n               vast majesty.\n\n                                     GUERNSEY\n                              (thunders out)\n                         The age is closed! The end is at \n                         hand! The seal is broken!\n\n               So saying, he reverts to the little old man he was, wheezing \n               a bit, and with some effort, climbs back on his bed and lies \n               there, eyes closed. His thin, high nose projects from the \n               whiteness of his face. He sighs the rattling last sigh of \n               life and dies. CAMERA DOLLIES slowly to CLOSE-UP of Drummond \n               lying motionless on his bed. His eyes are wide, glinting in \n               the shadows, a man imbued. His cheeks are wet with tears of \n               exaltation.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Well! Not quite the burning bush \n                         perhaps but prodigal enough for me. \n                         I was to avenge the death of God and \n                         my own brutalization. I was to kill \n                         Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck \n                         and the dialysis nurse Miss \n                         Campanella, whose negligence caused \n                         my coma.\n\n               FULL SHOT of Drummond. He raises his left hand, flexing his \n               fingers. Then he moves his other arm, his head, his shoulders. \n               Obviously, he is regaining his faculties.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         I awaited a further sign from God, \n                         which was given to me later that \n                         evening. Dr. Schaefer, it seems, had \n                         arranged an assignation with a girl \n                         from the hematology lab named Sheila.\n\n               ACROSS Drummond to the now empty other bed. All the lights \n               are on. PAN on Nurse Penny Canduso and an orderly wheeling \n               away the wrapped body of Guernsey. Intern Schaefer, at the \n               door, considers the empty bed with interest. Moving to the \n               bedtable, he picks up the receiver of the phone.\n\n                                     SCHAEFER\n                              (on phone)\n                         Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. \n                         Hey listen, I got us a bed for \n                         tonight.

Apparently, the coast is clear. She quickly \n               slips out.\n\n               ROOM 806. DAY\n\n               Drummond on his chair.

And then a second nurse came \n                         and plugged the I.V. jar into \n                         Schaefer. God clearly intended a \n                         measure of irony here. The hospital \n                         was to do all the killing for me. \n                         All I need do was arrange for the \n                         doctors to become patients in their \n                         own hospital. Accordingly, the next \n                         morning, I set out for Dr. Ives. I \n                         put on Dr. Schaefer's uniform, pinched \n                         some digoxine from the pharmacy and \n                         a sandbag from a utility cart, and \n                         found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory. \n                         I coshed him with the sandbag, gave \n                         him a massive shot of the digoxine. \n                         This, you see, brought on an instant \n                         condition of cardiac arrhythmia. \n                         When he came to, I brought him down \n                         to the Emergency Room.\n\n               EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, LOBBY. DAY\n\n               The usual E.R. crush and motion goes on in the background. \n               Drummond escorts an obviously ill Dr. Ives to the Admitting \n               Room.

I was in there a \n                         little while ago, and he was suddenly \n                         taken ill, and I thought I'd better \n                         get him over here right away.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                              (off-screen)\n                         He had at that time perhaps an hour \n                         to live.

I've been here ten minutes, \n                         I can't seem to get anybody to help \n                         me. I'm suffering from some sort of \n                         amnesia. I can't remember my name. \n                         As a matter of fact, it's pretty \n                         screwy. I got mugged. Two hours ago, \n                         walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty-\n                         Seventh Street and Second Avenue, \n                         eight o'clock in the morning, broad \n                         daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen-\n                         year-old girl walks up to me, shows \n                         me a knife about a yard long and \n                         says, \"Give me your wallet.\" I thought \n                         she was kidding. I mean there's \n                         hundreds of people walking right by. \n                         Well, she wasn't kidding. \"Listen,\" \n                         I said, \"all I got's about twenty \n                         bucks.\" So she takes the wallet \n                         anyway. So I said, \"How about leaving \n                         me my identification?\" I mean, I had \n                         my driver's license, my Diner's Club, \n                         my credit cards. But she took them \n                         all, the whole damn wallet, credit \n                         cards, everything. So I stopped some \n                         guy, I said, \"Hey, you see that girl \n                         there, walking away?\" He says, \"Yeah.\" \n                         I said, \"She just stole my wallet, \n                         credit cards and everything.\" He \n                         says, \"Well, that's what they want, \n                         the credit cards.\" So I started \n                         looking for a cop. I mean, go find a \n                         cop, right? Well, I finally find a \n                         cop. The girl's halfway to South \n                         America by now, probably bought the \n                         ticket with my credit cards. So the \n                         cop says, \"What's your name?\" And \n                         you want to know something? I couldn't \n                         think of my name. The girl took all \n                         my identification, you know what I \n                         mean? She took all my credit cards. \n                         So I said, \"You know this is screwy. \n                         I can't think of my name.\" So he \n                         took me to the station house. The \n                         sergeant says, \"What's your name?\" I \n                         said, \"I don't know! She took all my \n                         credit cards!\" So they took me down \n                         here. So what do you think, Doctor? \n                         I'm nuts, right? I finally flipped.\n\n               PAN SLOWLY to Drummond who stares at the Nameless Man.\n\n               In BACKGROUND the door opens and Mrs. Cushing, the lady from \n               accounting, enters.

So \n                         at nine-fifteen this morning, I rang \n                         for my nurse...\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         You rang for your nurse?\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                         To insure one full hour of \n                         uninterrupted privacy.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Oh yes.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                         I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella \n                         off to the operating rooms, replaced \n                         her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni's, \n                         exchanged charts and identity \n                         bracelets. She died officially of \n                         anesthesia shock. But, in point of \n                         fact, she died because she was wearing \n                         another woman's identity.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                              (to Bock)\n                         God, what do we do now? Let me take \n                         him back to Mexico. It's a simple \n                         world there. If you turn him in, \n                         they'll just cage him in the Rockland \n                         State Hospital for the Criminally \n                         Insane. Let me take him back, Herb.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Are you kidding? We'll both take \n                         him. I'm going with you! Get him \n                         dressed. We're getting out of here \n                         before the police put us all in \n                         Rockland State.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                         I haven't finished my work here. I \n                         have this Welbeck to dispose of. I \n                         am the angel of the bottomless pit \n                         and the wrath of the lamb.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         Oh dear, he's having another \n                         revelation.\n\n               Bock holds Drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his \n               arm. He finds the entranced Drummond as rigid as a statue.\n\n                                     BOCK\n                         Look, that ambulance must be here by \n                         now. You go down and get them. I'll \n                         give him a shot of something to knock \n                         him out. We'll take him to the airport \n                         in the ambulance.\n\n               They both hurry out of the room. Drummond remains enmarbled \n               in his trance. CAMERA SUDDENLY MOVES DOWN to William Mead, \n               whose eyes now open; he has heard it all. In background, \n               Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads \n               for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr. \n               Schaefer's uniform. He puts them on, tucking in the tails of \n               his hospital shift. He notices William Mead staring at him.\n\n                                     DRUMMOND\n                         You're hallucinating again.\n\n               William Mead just stares at Drummond.\n\n               EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA\n\n               Bock and Barbara come hurrying around the corner from the \n               west corridor. Barbara heads for the elevators. Bock heads \n               for the Nurses' Station. The Eighth Floor is going about its \n               normal 1:15 P.M. activity. Mrs. Donovan is at her desk on \n               the phone.\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                         ...Edwards never showed up. I'm short-\n                         staffed as hell. It's just me and \n                         Felicia. It's like Sunday. Nobody's \n                         here.\n\n                                     DR. BIEGELMAN\n                         I'll be at lunch...\n\n               A nurse's aid, a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors \n               stroll by. It's the end of the lunch hour, when the kitchen \n               workers bring used trays back.\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                         Yeah, you gotta send me somebody... \n                         Oh yeah?\n\n               Bock moves past Mrs. Donovan and into the pharmacy where we \n               see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe. An \n               elevator arrives, disgorging Milton Mead and his resident \n               assistant, Thomas Hitchcock and, of all people, Dr. Richard \n               Welbeck himself. Barbara and Dr. Biegelman go into the \n               elevator. The doors close. Milton Mead and Hitchcock head \n               for the west corridor. Welbeck, in his natty double-breasted \n               suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the \n               Nurses' Station.\n\n                                     MEAD\n                         We'll be in Eight-O-Six.\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                              (chuckles into phone)\n                         ...then what did she say?\n\n                                     WELBECK\n                              (to Mrs. Donovan)\n                         I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on \n                         this floor named Drummond, and I'd \n                         like to see his chart.\n\n                                     MRS. DONOVAN\n                         I'll call you back.\n\n               Bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle \n               of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe. He scowls at \n               Welbeck, who scowls back.\n\n                                     WELBECK\n                         Oh, Dr. Bock.

Then, pausing \n                         only to send in your bill, you flew \n                         off on the wings of man to an island \n                         of sun in Montego Bay.

You're greedy, unfeeling, \n                         inept, indifferent, self-inflating \n                         and unconscionably profitable. Aside \n                         from that, I have nothing against \n                         you. I'm sure you play a hell of a \n                         game of golf.

Every door of the corridor fills with secretaries \n               and administrators unsure of what's happening. Then, Sundstrom \n               elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his \n               doorway and comes into the corridor.
