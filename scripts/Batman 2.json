Hell's frozen over.\n\n     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.\n     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks\n     uncharacteristically serene -- almost <u>inviting</u>.  Peace has\n     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation\n     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as\n     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:\n     \"JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till\n     Christmas.\"\n\n     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir\n     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-\n     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is\n     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key\n     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a\n     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously\n     wants more.\n\n     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of\n     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading \"AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE\n     BATWING -- $19.95 and up.\"  A PANHANDLER is perched at the\n     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt\n     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this\n     winter, Batmania is everywhere...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged\n     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are\n     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a\n     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...\n\n     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all\n     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,\n     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to\n     the few passersby.\n\n     They've just gone into a lovely <i>a capella</i> rendition of \"Silent\n     Night\" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow\n     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides\n     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice\n     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time\n     of year.\n\n     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck\n     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --\n\n     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the\n     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows\n     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot\n     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as\n     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through\n     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.\n\n     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a\n     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR\n     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...\n\n     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the\n     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later\n     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.\n\n     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a\n     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing\n     into a drift.\n\n     <u><b>INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the\n     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give\n     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the\n     Salvation Army SANTA...\n\n     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The\n     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA\n     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already\n     burdened with LOOT.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's\n     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a\n     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid\n     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of\n     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of\n     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy\n     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple\n     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to\n     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,\n     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.\n\n     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are\n     obviously going to get away clean -- <u>unless</u>...\n\n     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is\n     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...\n\n     <u><b>INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the\n     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few\n     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes\n     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.\n\n     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross\n     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.\n     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.\n\n<b>                               COP\n</b>               What the hell -- ?\n\n     <u><b>EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     BRAKES SQUEAL.  <u>Several</u> squad cars are now massed at the\n     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's\n     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance\n     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading \"CLOSED TO TRAFFIC.\"  A\n     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all\n     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the\n     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.\n\n     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct\n     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls\n     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio\n     mike:\n\n<b>                               COP WITH MIKE\n</b>               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!\n                    <i>(pause)</i>\n               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??\n\n     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the\n     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK\n     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of\n     stopping...\n\n     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second\n     later...\n\n     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the\n     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING\n     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the\n     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!\n\n     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS\n     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're <u>sweating</u>.  One of\n     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:\n\n<b>                               COP I\n</b>               ...That was <u>Batman</u>.\n\n<b>                               COP II\n</b><b>               NO SHIT!!\n</b>\n     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others\n     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared\n     a path, they might as well join in the chase...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS\n     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are\n     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of\n     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the\n     horizon...\n\n     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,\n     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they\n     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting\n     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the\n     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar\n     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES\n     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the\n     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the\n     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other\n     COPS race past him on foot.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN</b></u>\n\n     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING\n     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up\n     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the\n     left and right...\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING</b></u>\n\n     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\n     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING\n     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and\n     disappear.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING</b></u>\n\n     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears\n     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,\n     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN\n     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a\n     hill...\n\n     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The\n     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands\n     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --\n     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks\n     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING</b></u>\n\n     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees\n     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a\n     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the\n     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and\n     explodes harmlessly.\n\n     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the\n     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As\n     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,\n     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to\n     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES\n     ITSELF into a distant TREE.\n\n     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the\n     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the\n     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-\n     heels into a drift.\n\n     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,\n     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits\n     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.\n     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,\n     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS\n     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They\n     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and\n     disappear over a crest of a hill...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4</b></u>\n\n     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge\n     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind\n     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.\n     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface\n     of the lake.\n\n     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips\n     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.\n     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just\n     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The\n     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --\n\n     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left\n     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is\n     sliding forward.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN</b></u>\n\n     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock\n     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no\n     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.\n     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --\n\n     <u><b>EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE</b></u>\n\n     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING\n     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of\n     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,\n     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN</b></u>\n\n     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE\n     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on\n     the dashboard...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4</b></u>\n\n     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost\n     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.\n     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...\n\n     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,\n     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.\n     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water\n     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they\n     know what's hit them.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING</b></u>\n\n     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled\n     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of\n     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky\n     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a\n     clearing...\n\n     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts\n     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of\n     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying\n     to build up speed.\n\n     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the\n     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of\n     the Batmobile rises half a foot --\n\n     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is\n     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA\n     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his\n     tracks.\n\n     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the\n     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is\n     almost atop him --\n\n     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded\n     frame.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up\n     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a\n     dull ROAR in the distance...\n\n     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,\n     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his\n     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.\n\n     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the\n     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.\n     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and\n     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his\n     colleague and SHRUGS:\n\n<b>                               COP I\n</b>               ...Merry Christmas.\n\n     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.\n\n<b>                               COP II\n</b>               Gift-wrapped and everything.\n\n                                                       <b>DISSOLVE TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>EXT. CITY HALL - DAY</b></u>\n\n     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,\n     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER\n     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.\n\n<b>                               GORDON\n</b>               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000\n               in precious jewels were recovered intact\n               by the police force -- working in concert\n               with Batman.\n\n     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the\n     crowd:\n\n<b>                               VOICES IN CROWD\n</b><b>               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!

The CHANTERS are a group\n     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early\n     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman\n     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're\n     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we\n     saw in the park.\n\n     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs\n     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard\n     over the din.\n\n<b>                               GORDON\n</b>               I would like to stress -- that while this\n               city enjoys a special relationship with\n               Batman --\n                    <i>(louder)</i>\n               -- we do not condone <u>vigilantism</u> --\n                    <i>(practically screaming)</i>\n<b>               -- IN ANY FORM.\n</b>\n     It's no use.

As he trims the crusts from a pair of\n     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.\n\n     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.\n     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered\n     the mike...\n\n                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)\n               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is\n               alive in this city.  We're gonna <u>take back</u>\n               <u>the streets</u>!\n\n     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to\n     chant: \"TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!\"\n     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and\n     flicks it off.\n\n     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.\n     \"Good King Wenceslas\" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED\n     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a\n     Sterling silver tea service.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped\n     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big\n     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a\n     side drawer.\n\n     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER\n     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads \"THOMAS WAYNE\n     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.\n     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.\"  ALFRED digs\n     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at\n     the rear of the drawer.\n\n     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the\n     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE\n     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.\n     \"Good King Wenceslas\" is on the speakers down here as well.\n     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,\n     wrapped in a tarp.\n\n     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea\n     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and\n     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels\n     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of\n<b>     BRUCE.\n</b>\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??\n\n     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant\n     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE\n     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF\n<b>     A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.\n</b>\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.\n\n     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --\n     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,\n     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in\n     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly\n     regains his composure:\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               I took the liberty of preparing tea.\n                    <i>(indicating tbe monitors)</i>\n               I take it you've been watching the news?\n\n     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview\n     and nods.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.\n\n     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off\n     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the\n     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops\n     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black\n     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,\n     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               I should inform you...Christmas is\n               approaching, and we've received our annual\n               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.\n                    <i>(eyeing the equipment)</i>\n               If I may inquire...?\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Oh, yeah.  Watch this.\n\n     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the\n     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --\n     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably\n     like the skeleton of an umbrella.\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly <is> it?\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               What does it look like?\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               To the untrained eye, sir, it looks\n               remarkably like...the skeleton of an\n               umbrella.\n\n     Sounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,\n     smiles slyly.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right.\n\n     BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He\n     sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,\n     pours a cup of tea.\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad\n               you're putting your time to such\n               productive use.\n                    <i>(beat)</i>\n               Now -- the Toy Fund.

He seems\n     oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts\n     are obviously a million miles away.  ALFRED looks on,\n     concerned:\n\n                               ALFRED (cont.)\n               Is something troubling you, sir?\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Yeah...the holidays, I guess.

Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen\n     of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,\n     cardinals, titwillows...\n\n     CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY\n     ODD FIGURE in prison greys.  A CANARY, perched on his\n     shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,\n     cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS\n     with quick, birdlike strokes.\n\n     MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems\n     his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is\n     \"obscene.\"  Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports\n     himself with overblown, theatrical dignity.  Fastidious and\n     preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.\n\n     CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --\n     and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.  A PRISON\n     GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...\n\n<b>                               GUARD\n</b>               Up and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy?\n\n     MR.

BONIFACE finally turns.  With an expression of extreme\n     distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the\n     canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,\n     hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,\n     MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.  BONIFACE\n     whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH\n<b>     RAGE:\n</b>\n<b>                               MR.

BONIFACE -- aka THE\n     PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally\n     attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a\n     deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of\n     exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading\n     his wings, REVELING in the cold.\n\n     A STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture-\n     like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and\n     umbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK\n     and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and\n     \"business managers.\"\n\n<b>                               FRICK\n</b>               Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               Mr. Frick.

He winces, and removes the\n     headphones...\n\n     The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,\n     high-pitched WHINE.

Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped\n     down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.\n\n     He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a\n     frenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,\n     SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the\n     ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like\n     rabbits, terrified...\n\n     By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,\n     T-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming,\n     man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings\n     insanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS\n     blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.\n\n     All at once, the PIGEONS take off <i>en masse</i> -- leaving T-BONE's\n     mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the\n     Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing\n     but ROCK MUSIC -- \"Surfin' Bird\" by the Trashmen.

She's dark and elegant, fine-\n     boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know\n     it yet, is SELINA KYLE.\n\n     She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf\n     Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN\n     at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the\n     felt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she\n     finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene\n     indifference.\n\n     The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.

He tries to jerk\n     his hand away, but he can't break her grip.

RICKY is hypnotized.\n\n     She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow\n     -- intriguing.

Something major\n     is about to happen...\n\n     The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a\n     black MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the\n     gangplank.\n\n     Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on\n     the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to\n     a colleague:\n\n<b>                               DOCK GOON I\n</b>               Where's that goddam Ricky?\n\n<b>                               DOCK GOON II\n</b>               Probably out gettin' laid.

STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's\n     bag.  The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING\n     CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.\n\n<b>                               BOAT THUG I\n</b>               You pick.\n\n     The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.  Two BOAT THUGS tip\n     it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --\n     revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.\n\n     <u><b>POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a\n     ramshackle boathouse at water's edge.  Down on the deck of the\n     steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the\n     merchandise.\n\n<b>                               LIEUTENANT\n</b>               It's pure.\n\n     <u><b>REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.\n     The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only\n     details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY\n<b>     EARS...\n</b>\n<b>                               CHIEF GOON (O.S.)\n</b>               Let's do it.\n\n     He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH\n     assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT\n     THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to\n     the big hook.\n\n<b>                               BOAT THUG I\n</b>               Hold it.  Let's see the money.\n\n     Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase\n     and opens it.  Lots of long green inside.  The BOAT THUG\n     signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the\n     goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.\n\n     <u><b>LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     The goon with the suitcase marches up.  Beyond him, in the\n     distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof\n     and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the\n<b>     CRANE.\n</b>\n     <u><b>ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone\n     holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck\n     and crane swings over the pier.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the\n     air.\n\n     <u><b>ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down\n     onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.  The crates\n     explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and\n     random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.\n\n     <u><b>ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     Nobody knows quite what's going on.  Panicking, the GOON with\n     the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the\n     gangplank.  BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick\n     shot.  Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the\n     drink, suitcase and all.\n\n     Pandemonium.  All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.  Thinking\n     he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON\n     and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.\n\n<b>                               BOAT THUG I\n</b><b>               YOU SON OF A BITCH!\n</b>                    <i>(to another BOAT THUG)</i>\n               Go after it.  Get the money.  GO!!\n\n     He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --\n     diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.  Everyone's\n     ducking for cover.  BOAT THUG I barks orders at the\n     pilothouse:\n\n<b>                               BOAT THUG I\n</b>               Soltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!!\n\n<b>                               ANOTHER BOAT THUG\n</b><b>               LOOK!\n</b>\n     BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE\n     landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky\n     black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is\n     concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with\n     openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous\n     touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.\n\n     She bares her teeth and HISSES.\n\n     It's a woman.\n\n     BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes\n     him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She\n     SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,\n     RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps\n     to the deck, lifeless.\n\n     The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw\n     with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him\n     toppling into the water.\n\n     The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the\n     pier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the\n     DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the\n     boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.\n\n     Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky\n     specimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one\n     goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off\n     the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more\n     reeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up\n     action takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she\n     stands back to survey the scene.\n\n     Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in\n     the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow\n     is speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in\n     their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down\n     and softly MOANING.\n\n     Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the\n     wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE\n     POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all\n     about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.\n     Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the\n     sides of the crates.\n\n     She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents\n     until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.  She opens\n     it carefully and holds it up for inspection.  The statuette of\n     a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the\n     moonlight.\n\n     The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the\n     MOANING PUNK's back pocket.  Then, cradling the raven under\n     one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.\n\n     A LANTERN approaches.  It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of\n     hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the\n     sight of the carnage on the docks.  He kneels beside the\n     moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the\n     PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.\n\n<b>                               PUNK\n</b>               Murcielago.

It's\n     not a whale; it's too pink.  It is, instead, the PENGUIN --\n     and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK\n     standing in the open doorway.\n\n<b>                               FRICK\n</b>               Mr. Boniface?

Two of his\n     LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a\n     long chain, into place over his head.  He grasps it with both\n     hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk\n     out of the water.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we\n     can't see her face, there must be something distinctively\n     <u>feline</u> about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and\n     fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she\n     strolls past.\n\n     FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...\n\n     <u><b>INT.

She rolls off suddenly; when he\n     tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single\n     finger.\n\n     Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,\n     twisting them around into tight cords.  With a coy smile she\n     runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and\n     then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and\n     ties it off on the bedpost.\n\n<b>                               SHAW\n</b>               Hey, what are you doing -- ?\n\n     He tries to break her grip.

He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY\n     METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as\n     part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.\n\n     But it's no umbrella.  When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his\n     BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding\n     -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.\n\n     He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS\n     THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise\n     past far below.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

She's just\n     made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped\n     for a moment of Quality Time.\n\n     She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.  Her whole\n     body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes\n     dart left.\n\n     A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.\n     The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest\n     of seconds before he steps back into the shadows.  She acts\n     like she hasn't noticed...\n\n     ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.\n\n     <u><b>TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.  If it's\n     possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're\n     seeing it now.\n\n     <u><b>HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     She still doesn't let on that she's seen him.  Instead, she\n     goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a\n     gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little\n     private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE\n     ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     His jaw is down around his knees.  <u>Whoa</u>.  He edges forward\n     slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...\n\n     She hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left\n     and right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN\n     jumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small\n     WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and\n     she VANISHES over the edge.\n\n     Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in\n     time to see --\n\n     <u><b>EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,\n     flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master\n     gymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS\n     -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect\n     landing on the roof of a passing BUS.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He\n     kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled\n     upon it...\n\n                            <b>LOOKING FOR LOVE?</b>\n\n     He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the\n     edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the\n     entrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun,\n     figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the\n     face.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the\n     rooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as\n     he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.\n\n<b>                               COP\n</b>               Hey.  You see what I saw...?\n\n     This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right\n     on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK,\n     who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.\n\n<b>                               BULLOCK\n</b>               It's Randall Shaw.

A BLACK\n     SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing\n     among the branches...\n\n     We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving\n     finally at:\n\n     <u><b>EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks\n     and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park\n     Towers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest\n     nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift\n     soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.\n\n     VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's\n     trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.\n\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               Please, just one.

It\n               always does.\n\n     VICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and\n     wailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and\n     a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.\n     All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE\n     IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,\n     RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.\n\n     Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with\n     swift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and\n     gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.\n\n     VICKI waits for the police sirens, but <u>they don't come</u>.  She\n     backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS\n     FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.\n\n     A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --\n     sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the\n     snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.\n     He points her out to a colleague...\n\n     ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with\n     pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's\n     slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers\n     are almost upon her...\n\n     ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES\n     one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to\n     the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.\n\n     The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the\n     FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the\n     way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his\n     head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow\n     from the second guy's tire iron.\n\n     In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's\n     belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the\n     tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets\n     to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING\n     the iron --\n\n     -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-\n     KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has\n     nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit\n     the ground.\n\n     The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with\n     astonishment.\n\n     It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,\n     grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at\n     him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the\n     aid of his fellow homeless...\n\n     She can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into\n     the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and <u>kicks ass</u> --\n     spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display\n     of pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once.\n     There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle\n     himself like this...\n\n     Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch\n     bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide\n     turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed\n     resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and\n     race off to their VAN.\n\n     Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster\n     together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that\n     everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the\n     trees.\n\n     But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID\n     runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --\n     TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID\n     throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at\n     him...\n\n     CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,\n     BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there\n     with a baseball bat.\n\n     He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his\n     feet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light\n     out again when --\n\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               <u>WAIT</u>!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to <u>thank</u>\n               you.

She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID\n     snatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other\n     for a long moment --\n\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               ...Who <u>are</u> you?\n\n<b>                               KID\n</b>               Dick.\n\n     -- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a\n     tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to\n     follow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs\n     into her CAMERA BAG...\n\n     <u><b>HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS</b></u>\n\n     Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the\n     treetops.  She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks\n     of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from\n     limb to limb...\n\n     For a moment it seems like she's lost him.  As she sweeps the\n     lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of\n     an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.  She ups the\n     magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.  The\n     stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE\n     -- BRUCE's great-grandfather.\n\n     As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet\n     from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.  He\n     looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then\n     races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small\n     hillocks, over a frozen creek.\n\n     There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,\n     mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate\n     and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place\n     behind him.  Home sweet home.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     as she lowers the lens.  Her face is full of conflicting\n     emotions.  She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find\n     out what his story is.  But on the other hand -- even the\n     homeless are entitled to their privacy...\n\n                                                            <b>CUT TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT.

THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of\n     the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX\n     handcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's\n     inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just\n     about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.\n\n     The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without\n     incident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the\n     frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which\n     reads:\n\n                        <b>BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?</b>\n                 <b>Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!</b>\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

But no...the GUARDS are safely\n     inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back\n     to wait.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and\n     the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the\n     windshield.\n\n     They turn into the <u>Globe</u>'s BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of\n     similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the\n     fleet...\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --\n     sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at\n     arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.\n\n     Satisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer\n     for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.\n\n<b>                               PROVOST\n</b>               Open this in an hour.

In FG, the small dormer-like structure that\n     houses the STAIRWAY.  The metal access door opens, and the\n     first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready.

We get another faint series of\n     POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the\n     loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.\n\n     He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all.  He scans\n     the roof of the <u>Globe</u> building, but he can't see what's\n     happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon\n     sign...\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue\n     from the darkness.  An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the\n     emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a\n     corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed\n     spastic.  The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points\n     up at the LIGHT:\n\n<b>                               GUARD\n</b>               <u>There</u>.  Mr. Provost.  <u>See</u>?  The\n               generator's kicked in.  It's just an\n               electrical problem.\n\n     PROVOST is only marginally consoled.  They hear a strange\n     TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...\n\n     PROVOST starts babbling again.  The GUARD slaps him across the\n     face.  But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well.  He\n     stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on\n     the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.\n\n<b>                               GUARD\n</b>               There.

But I need you to\n               help me.  Okay?  You have to help.\n\n     PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself.  The GUARD\n     looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car.  He can't\n     reach it...\n\n     He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist\n     -- and STANDS on it.  Still short.  Unholstering his gun and\n     using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door.  He\n     JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the\n     panel slightly.\n\n     More TWITTERING.  PROVOST and the guard look up through the\n     tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.\n\n<b>                               GUARD\n</b>               Probably just some bird that's gotten in\n               the shaft.

PROVOST gives him a\n     boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap\n     door.\n\n                               GUARD (cont.)\n               Okay, help me out...steady...\n\n     PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and\n     tries to hoist him upward.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

Now\n     his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls\n     himself upward.\n\n     He peers around.  His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight\n     -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front\n     of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...\n\n     <u><b>INT.

Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --\n     even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...\n\n     Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much.  PROVOST\n     trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his\n     ass in a corner of the car.  The GUARD tumbles in a heap to\n     the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond\n     recognition, his eyes gone altogether.\n\n     PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS.  He peers at the open\n     trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and\n<b>     SHRIEKS AGAIN.\n</b>\n     The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings.  He stares at it.  It rings\n     again.  Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,\n     PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.\n\n                               PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)\n               Sixteenth floor.

FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical\n     equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been\n     LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's\n     private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The\n     PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               Mr. Provost?

A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been\n     lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper\n     production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the\n     other side.

He grits his teeth, but hastens\n     to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the\n     box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him\n     into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.\n\n                               PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)\n               When you're done, I want you to give two\n               sharp yanks on the cord.\n\n     Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it\n     twice.\n\n<b>                               PROVOST\n</b>               Who are you??

He tries to get up,\n     but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,\n     knocking him back into a cornice.  He ducks right just as a\n     SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three\n     inches from his throat.\n\n     He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and\n     lands on her feet.  Cats always do...\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               My, aren't we frisky tonight.\n\n     He flings the BATARANG.  It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as\n     she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.  GLASS TUBING\n     shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               I should tell you -- I've got nine lives\n               to play with -- and you've only got one...\n\n     He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a\n     death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly\n     toward the HELICOPTER.  The huge ROTOR BLADES are still\n     turning...\n\n     BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --\n     FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.  It's a strategic move: when\n     he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and\n     KICKS UPWARD with startling force.\n\n     This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his\n     feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.\n     He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on\n     him.\n\n     She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around\n     his CROTCH.  He tries to break her grip, but <u>she's just as</u>\n     <u>strong as he is</u>.  And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,\n     toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the\n     helicopter!\n\n     The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises\n     perilously closer.  At the last possible instant, he grabs a\n     handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --\n\n     With a YOWL, she releases him.  They tumble to the roof and\n     she DIVES ATOP HIM.  Her TALONS click into place -- he sees\n     them poised directly above his EYES --\n\n     -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can\n     strike.  Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and\n     circle each other...\n\n     SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the\n     roof, trying to break it down.  BATMAN turns for an instant --\n     a sudden CRACK --\n\n     -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-\n     O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.  She\n     sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he\n     collapses to the roof in a jittering heap.  The BANGING on the\n     door is louder...\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               Did I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep\n               'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.\n\n     She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching\n     face.  Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,\n<b>     DISAPPEARING --\n</b>\n     -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes\n     crashing out onto the roof!\n\n     Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but\n     the COPS are swarming the place.  They spot the BODIES on the\n     tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the\n     obvious conclusion.  Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.  BULLETS\n     RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.\n\n     BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a\n     GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which\n     is a couple of stories taller than the <u>Globe</u> -- and REELS\n     HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.  The SWAT COPS score a\n     couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,\n     but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough\n     to reach the roof.\n\n                                                            <b>CUT TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The\n     roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for\n     step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the\n     next, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a\n     building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go\n     but down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to\n     him --\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               Ooh.  Where have you <u>been</u> all my life?\n\n     He edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY\n<b>     OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.\n</b>\n     BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves\n     closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.\n\n     <u><b>BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade\n     of the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of\n     a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping\n     in the chill wind.\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

A sudden CRACK --\n\n     The CATWOMAN <u>hasn't</u> entered the apartment.  Instead, she's\n     followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently\n     doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as\n     her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a\n     sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER\n<b>     THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.\n</b>\n     <u><b>EXT.

The WHIP\n     has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding\n     tight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away\n     from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip\n     UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.\n\n     He manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a\n     massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from\n     moving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down\n     to the pavement...\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low,\n     soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage\n     mask she bats her eyelashes.\n\n                               CATWOMAN (cont.)\n               It's just so hard to meet interesting men\n               these days.

I think\n               people should indulge their fantasies,\n               don't you?\n\n     BATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much\n     longer.

I'll be thinking about you.\n\n     And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with\n     her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment,\n     tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He\n     braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his\n     grappling gun and FIRES.\n\n     The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line\n     taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --\n\n     -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               Gee...I'm <u>so fickle</u>.\n\n     A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly\n     SEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's\n     still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten\n     feet...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN</b></u>\n\n     watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to\n     DISLODGE.  It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof\n     and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the\n<b>     CORNICE --\n</b>\n     -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.  Fascinated, the\n     CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS</b></u>\n\n     He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up\n     toward him.  He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS\n     CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch.  The rods in his\n     cape begin to INFLATE...\n\n     Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.\n     Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.\n     Four stories up, he rights himself.  Three stories up, he goes\n     into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide\n     arcs over the street...\n\n     ...and a moment later there are no stories left.  With an ugly\n     crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.\n     Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the\n     middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

PEDESTRIANS\n     are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and\n     peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the\n     street:\n\n<b>                               DRIVER\n</b>               What the hell is <u>this</u>?\n\n     CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few\n     blocks over.

A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is\n     forming around the prostrate BATMAN.  The COP blows his\n     whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN\n     rush up to join him.\n\n     They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.\n     The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body\n     armor.

One of them tugs at his mask --\n     but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.  He feels\n     around --\n\n<b>                               TRAFFIC COP\n</b>               Some kinda seam here on the neck...\n\n     The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like\n     fastening under BATMAN's chin.  The instant it comes open --\n\n     -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS\n     in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,\n     shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.\n     Booby-trap -- they've just been <u>Maced</u>.\n\n     One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.\n     On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.  The\n     body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --\n\n<b>                               TRAFFIC COP\n</b>               DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.

BATMAN is back among the living.\n     SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing\n     out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --\n\n     Fuck the crowd.  TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire\n     in absolute panic.  BATMAN slams backward into the delivery\n     truck and crumples to the ground.  As he falls, he grabs a\n     couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the\n     pavement.\n\n     Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading\n     through the intersection.  BATMAN emerges into the midst of\n     the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

He rears the horse back, turns it\n     in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute\n     the incoming cars...\n\n     Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.  He\n     looks down.  He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden\n     JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.\n\n     BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over\n     to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of\n     the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.  He digs in his heels,\n     maneuvering through traffic...\n\n     <u><b>EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks\n     off trying to get through the jam.  Their siren is on, but the\n     cars blocking their path have no room to pull over.

On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.\n\n     Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car\n     immediately into REVERSE.  As they watch, BATMAN kicks the\n     horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

They tumble into a snowdrift as\n     BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and\n     gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process.  By now,\n     SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...\n\n     <u><b>INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP\n     CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the\n     park.  BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white\n     whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than\n     twenty yards away.\n\n     He turns the horse in a circle.  MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the\n     distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered\n     from the opposite side of the park.  It's going to be tough\n     getting out of here...\n\n     Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,\n     GENERAL WAYNE -- <u>two</u> Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet\n     apart.  He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI\n     and gets an inspiration.\n\n     He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans\n     the little frozen creek.  There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL\n     VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate.  This must\n     be where the boy vigilante holes up...\n\n     He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's\n     saddle and sends it off with a slap.  He pries the grate loose\n     and crawls inside.\n\n     <u><b>INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in\n     the floor.\n\n     RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN\n     passes directly underneath.  A little farther back there's an\n     ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train\n     tracks below.\n\n     Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy\n     vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus\n     various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he\n     needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.\n\n     A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and\n     sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get\n     him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten\n     topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he\n     spies something extremely odd --\n\n     It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT\n     with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine\n     condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it\n     up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial,\n     \"R,\" in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying\n     ensemble in complete befuddlement...\n\n     The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING\n     NOISE.  <u>Someone's in the tunnel with him</u>.  He lowers the\n     costume abruptly --\n\n     -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front\n     of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through\n     the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder\n     messing with his stuff:\n\n<b>                               DICK\n</b>               It's MINE!\n\n     He lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back\n     into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --\n\n     <u><b>EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds\n     before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.\n     BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands\n     hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked\n     smile comes to his face...\n\n     Out here in the moonlight he can <u>see</u> his opponent.  The body\n     armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and\n     above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...\n\n     As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the\n     bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange\n     little boy's hands.\n\n     The kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head\n     up and down.  Then he takes off his <u>own</u> ratty coat and throws\n     it to BRUCE.\n\n     BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He\n     pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and\n     starts to move off.\n\n<b>                               DICK\n</b><b>               NO.  WAIT!\n</b>\n     BRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.\n\n     The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off\n     into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view,\n     he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --\n\n     -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE\n     makes haste in the opposite direction.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape\n     still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.\n\n     <u><b>INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     TWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in\n     front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the\n     headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in\n     the saddle.\n\n     The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he\n<b>     SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.\n</b>\n     A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the\n     squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen\n     ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the\n     horn and shouts out the window:\n\n<b>                               COP\n</b>               Dumb son of a bitch!!\n\n     The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.\n     The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.\n\n                                                            <b>CUT TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN</b></u>\n\n     A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe\n     and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE\n<b>     BANDAGE.\n</b>\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               Commissioner Gordon called.

His shirt\n     is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a\n     full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Great.

ALFRED tears off the tape with\n     a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF\n<b>     PAIN.\n</b>\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               <u>Jesus</u>, Alfred -- !!\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               In future, sir...I strongly advise against\n               trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               It's just a few bruises.\n\n<b>                               ALFRED\n</b>               <u>One</u> bruise, sir.

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY</b></u>\n\n     In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side\n     (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS\n     settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across\n     antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS\n     littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one\n     wall.\n\n     They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE\n     across the street...\n\n     <u><b>HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping\n     watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals \"all clear\"\n     to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.\n\n     <u><b>INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,\n     munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone.  They\n     spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on\n     his way to the brownstone.  One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks\n     up his RADIO MIKE:\n\n<b>                               PLAINCLOTHESMAN\n</b>               Mailman's coming.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER</b></u>\n\n     The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,\n     sorting through letters and packages.  He hasn't even rung the\n     bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches\n     the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS\n<b>     FACE.\n</b>\n     <u><b>INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --\n     unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.  They're in\n     for the long haul.\n\n     The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of\n     COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown\n     paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.  They carry it\n     gingerly into the kitchen.  Into the midst of all this\n     bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:\n\n<b>                               GORDON\n</b>               Anything suspicious!\n\n     In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are\n     examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light\n     bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.\n\n<b>                               COP\n</b>               Nothing yet.

TIPTREE pulls GORDON\n     aside.\n\n<b>                               TIPTREE\n</b>               They'll be safe, won't they?\n\n<b>                               GORDON\n</b>               As safe as we can make 'em.\n                    <i>(beat; sternly)</i>\n               It would help if you could give us some\n               small hint what this is all about.\n\n<b>                               TIPTREE\n</b>               I told you.

TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living\n     room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids\n     ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.  One of the COPS tries to\n     pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...\n\n     ...until a PHONE RINGS.  Everyone jumps at once.  A TECHNICIAN\n     hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,\n     then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...\n\n<b>                               TIPTREE\n</b>               Hello...?\n\n<b>                               VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER\n</b>               Mr. Tiptree?

The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment\n     as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff\n     jolt.\n\n     <u><b>INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY</b></u>\n\n     Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary\n     composing a LETTER.  He takes a long pull on a glass of\n     Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an\n     envelope.  He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a\n     .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes\n     it to the envelope.  He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.\n\n     A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.\n     He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the\n     ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.\n\n     He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,\n     onto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only\n     slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes\n     a FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:\n\n                 <b>IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD</b>\n\n     He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.\n\n                                                            <b>CUT TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The lights are on\n     in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching\n<b>     TV.\n</b>\n     <u><b>INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels\n     beside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls\n     out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed \"TO DADDY -- FROM\n<b>     SANTA.\"\n</b>\n     With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the\n     package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN\n     STATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then\n     slinks into the hallway...\n\n     <u><b>INT.

What the hell are you --\n\n     HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.\n     TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone\n     follow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a\n<b>     SUBWAY ENTRANCE.\n</b>\n     <u><b>INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS\n     come racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open\n     violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.\n     They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE\n<b>     TURNSTILE --\n</b>\n     -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling\n     down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The doors slide shut\n     behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as\n     he rolls off.\n\n<b>                               COP\n</b>               We've gotta get back to the radio.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

Derelicts,\n     prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-\n     heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his\n     suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...\n\n     An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a\n     DEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white\n     CARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language.\n     The other reads:\n\n                             <b>DEAF AND DUMB</b>\n                          <b>PLEASE HELP -- $1.00</b>\n\n     TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,\n     shining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,\n     stuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends\n     a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --\n\n     -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.\n     Now TIPTREE looks up.  THIS CARD bears a <u>personalized</u> message:\n\n                         <b>GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION</b>\n                       <b>B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW</b>\n\n     TIPTREE's eyes widen.  The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --\n     glowers down and holds out his cup.  TIPTREE digs in his\n     pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands\n     it over anyway.\n\n     Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next\n     car.  TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card.  He fidgets\n     with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...\n\n     <u><b>INT.

TIPTREE\n     emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS\n     thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as\n     they scan the crowd.\n\n     Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the\n     nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold\n     the SUITCASE out of view.\n\n     <u><b>INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER</b></u>\n\n     TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to\n     close.  He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the\n     doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT.  He stands\n     there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the\n     train lurches forward...\n\n     False alarm.  The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

He sits there panting...\n\n     Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car.  TIPTREE does a\n     take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!\n     Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --\n<b>     FRACK...\n</b>\n                                                           <b>WIPE TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The station is EMPTY except\n     for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a\n     WOMAN in a long fur coat.\n\n     TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,\n     STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor.  There's something\n     familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed\n     hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.\n     It is, of course, SELINA...\n\n     TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting\n     further instructions.  They aren't long in coming.  A BLACK\n     MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,\n     and STRUTS in front of him.\n\n<b>                               MYNAH\n</b><b>               FOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!

When it passes,\n     we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express\n     tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with\n     each step.  It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the\n     only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot\n     intervals.\n\n     He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly\n     switches to the local tracks.  The train rumbles past with a\n     deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his\n     surroundings.  TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the\n     tunnel...\n\n     ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a\n     small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE.  They've set up camp down\n     here in the tunnels, away from the elements.  Surrounded by\n     bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap\n     wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with\n     the suitcase who's invaded their domain.\n\n     TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening\n     down the tunnel.  The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with\n     one exception.  A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty\n     topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively\n     as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.\n\n     His face is familiar.  It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the\n     park.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,\n<b>     WHIRLS SUDDENLY --\n</b>\n     -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS\n     at the PENGUIN.

The PENGUIN lifts his\n     brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --\n\n     -- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He\n     spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the\n     ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of\n     sparks.\n\n     The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the\n     tracks.

They see the lights of a\n     TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're\n     standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The\n     PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the <u>inner</u> track,\n     where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag\n     TIPTREE out of the train's path...\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b><b>               GIVE ME A HAND!\n</b>\n     They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the\n     train arrives.

Before\n     he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN\n     approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the\n     last one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out\n     of its path...\n\n     ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN\n     comes barrelling down the center track <u>from the opposite</u>\n     <u>direction</u>!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side,\n     and there's no place to go --\n\n     The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.

There, encased in a plexiglass\n     case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City\n     Hall was erected.

His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls\n     out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem\n     to work.\n\n     SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --\n     purring and stretching...\n\n     <u><b>BRUCE'S POV</b></u>\n\n     A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory\n     smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               What di-- what did you d--\n\n     She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright\n     red.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               I guess I've...gotten under your skin.\n\n     <u><b>BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE</b></u>\n\n     His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes\n     SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.\n     He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually\n     going slack.\n\n     The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and\n     stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...\n\n                                                       <b>DISSOLVE TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>EXT.

She's curled up on\n     the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious\n     glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven\n     o'clock.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

He's got\n     all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a\n     window and throws the bundle outside.\n\n     There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from\n     the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make\n     it.  He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

There's a large VAN just behind the car --\n     driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles\n     pull in before the gates slide shut.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER\n     coming from around the house.\n\n     He races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars\n     out front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in\n     through the front door.\n\n     His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.\n     In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI\n     surrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and\n     twists her arm behind her back.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

He pats VICKI's\n     knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --\n\n     -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun.  A moment\n     of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time\n     to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and\n     vanish --\n\n     -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for\n     long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.\n     FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-\n     blank range.\n\n     VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.\n\n     <u><b>INT.

The blood drains out of his face.\n\n                               PENGUIN (cont.)\n               <u>Where's Wayne</u>???\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around\n     him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a\n     packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of\n     pills and swallows them dry.\n\n     Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping\n     switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind\n     BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.\n\n     <u><b>INSERT - MONITOR</b></u>\n\n     The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his\n     two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he\n               can't have gotten far.\n\n     <u><b>BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE</b></u>\n\n     He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and\n     waits.\n\n     <u><b>EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming\n     cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly --\n\n     -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over\n     every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!\n\n     <u><b>INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.\n     He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels\n     from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in\n     here...\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne\n     Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down\n     below.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               -- as soon as he gets to the East wing.\n               Wait for my signal.  You know what to do.\n\n     DICK nods yes and bolts off.\n\n     <u><b>INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the\n     commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-\n     fingered.\n\n     Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- \"SANTA\n     BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME.\"  FRICK turns and stares at it in\n     confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --\n\n     -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the\n     loudspeakers.\n\n                               BRUCE (O.S.; filter)\n<b>               VICKI!

The shot goes wild and\n     the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it\n     over...\n\n     <u><b>INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING\n     DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is\n     happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is\n     sealing itself off!\n\n     <u><b>INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on\n     the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before\n     FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the\n     back of the skull with a fireplace poker.\n\n     He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to\n     ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination\n     from the sofa.\n\n<b>                               DICK\n</b>               Here.

KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     VICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a\n     dial tone --\n\n<b>                               VOICE FROM BEHIND\n</b>               Do you really think we're <u>that</u> stupid?\n\n     VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is\n     SELINA's.\n\n                               SELINA (cont.)\n               I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!\n\n     With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out.  VICKI\n     turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before\n     she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around\n     her wrist, jerking the knife loose.  SELINA tugs on the other\n     end, reeling her closer.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               You know, I've got a great recipe for\n               Sliced Bitch --\n\n     VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and\n     throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island.  While\n     they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to\n     bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of\n     the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her\n     claws.  VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to\n     block the blow: CLANG.\n\n     VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA\n     with knives and appliances.  It buys her enough time to make\n     for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.  Another\n     downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK\n     into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in\n     the wood.\n\n     VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.\n\n     <u><b>INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               I love a good old-fashioned catfight --\n               but this is pissing me off.\n\n     VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED\n     COCKTAIL CART before her.  It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,\n     who lands on her back on the great long dining table.  VICKI\n     is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.\n\n     <u><b>INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     VICKI races up the stairs.  She has a good lead, but SELINA\n     makes up the difference in a hurry.  She takes the stairway in\n     three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks\n     down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her\n     and LOCKING IT.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty\n               kitty...\n\n     She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\n\n     <u><b>INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door\n     behind her.  VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading\n     to a balcony, but it's too long a drop.  She stands there\n     paralyzed as SELINA advances.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               So this is where you earn your keep.\n\n     She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves\n     her roughly back onto the bed.  VICKI flails wildly as SELINA\n     kneels atop her...\n\n     SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly\n     section of bra --\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               Mmm!  Frederick's of Gotham?\n\n     She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT\n     DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's\n     belly.  Now VICKI just loses it.  She begins to SHRIEK\n     uncontrollably.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               Not so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get\n               the wrong idea.\n                    <i>(laughing)</i>\n               Santa's coming.  Time for all good girls\n               to go to sleep...\n\n     She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's\n     neck.  But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes\n     wide-eyed and shuts up.  A BLACK SHADOW falls across the\n     moonlit bed.  SELINA tenses --\n\n     -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --\n\n<b>                               BATMAN\n</b>               Miss me, \"Angel\"?\n\n     He yanks her bodily off the bed.  Before she knows what's\n     happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.  She flies into\n     the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.\n\n     <u><b>INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself\n     up.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               Okay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me...\n               all the way this time.\n\n     She HISSES and jumps him.  They grapple -- a quick flurry of\n     fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long\n     stairway.\n\n     She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.\n     BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...\n\n     <u><b>INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     VICKI rushes out of the bedroom.  She looks down the hall and\n     sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --\n     slamming into the wall opposite.  He slumps to the carpet, out\n     cold.\n\n     A moment later DICK strolls out.  VICKI rushes to his side --\n\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               Come on.  We'll be safe in the cave.\n\n     <u><b>INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is\n     slightly ajar.  He pushes it in cautiously...\n\n     ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing\n     down mere inches from his face.  It's the PENGUIN wielding the\n     ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.\n     But then --\n\n     -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing\n     on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.\n     It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a\n     good workout in the next thirty seconds.\n\n     BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall\n     behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into\n     SELINA's ribs.  It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,\n     knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,\n     knocking over another -- and another --\n\n     -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,\n     domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the\n     cowering PENGUIN.\n\n     SELINA is badly hurt now.  She makes it out of a rear door to\n     the armory.  BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems\n     to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.\n\n     SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around\n     enough to dig himself out.\n\n     <u><b>INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the\n     LIBRARY.  VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a\n     bottom drawer.  A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...\n\n     <u><b>INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to\n<b>     DICK:\n</b>\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               Come on.

HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER</b></u>\n\n     The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of\n     the library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's\n     a flabbergasted look on his face -- he <u>recognizes</u> this kid.\n\n                                                           <b>WIPE TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER</b></u>\n\n     At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are\n     VICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a\n<b>     VOICE:\n</b>\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               Such primitive entertainment.\n\n     He's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about\n     delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.\n     His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its\n     little plateau.\n\n                               PENGUIN (cont.)\n               So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've\n               discovered <u>two</u> treasures!\n                    <i>(an evil smile)</i>\n               Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to\n               shoot you both.\n\n     He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.\n     He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of\n     the cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow\n     CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               The Gotham City Treasury.

She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her\n     head.\n\n     <u><b>INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT</b></u>\n\n     SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-\n     speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes\n     down the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking\n     the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.\n\n     He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs\n     it in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.\n\n<b>                               SELINA\n</b>               It could've been so nice -- you and me --\n               if only you weren't so screwed up.\n\n<b>                               BATMAN\n</b>               It's over.

She sighs.\n\n                               SELINA (cont.)\n               I'll never understand men.\n\n     She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.\n     As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the\n     narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall\n     floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the\n     enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --\n\n     -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up\n     a GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails\n     past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which\n     suspends the chandelier.\n\n     The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --\n     and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry\n     hall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand\n     fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies\n     sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.\n\n     BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut\n     out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering\n     YOWL OF PAIN -- a <u>cri du chat</u>.  He stands over her; she glares\n     up at him.\n\n<b>                               BATMAN\n</b>               Nine lives.\n\n<b>                               CATWOMAN\n</b>               I can't move.

With an agonizing effort\n     she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to\n     slit her own throat.\n\n     He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and\n     breaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered\n     glass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,\n     and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into\n     unconsciousness.\n\n     BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to\n     join him.\n\n<b>                               DICK\n</b>               You should've done it, man.

A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,\n     and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the\n     prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he\n     clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.\n\n     They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK\n     FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the\n     catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.

BATMAN swings his\n     cape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a\n     cautious step backward.\n\n     <u><b>CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND</b></u>\n\n     His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI</b></u>\n\n     They've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE\n     DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.\n\n<b>                               PENGUIN\n</b>               No sudden moves.  It's a long way down.\n\n     Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...\n\n     <u><b>HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO</b></u>\n\n     A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all\n     these years.  GLINTING in the darkness.  Hanging upside-down,\n     above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --\n     their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...\n\n     He dislodges a rock.  It tumbles into the grotto...\n\n     ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the\n     rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.\n\n     <u><b>ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI</b></u>\n\n     He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him.  He FIRES\n     HIS GUN wildly.  The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they\n     come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.\n     VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them\n     FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.\n\n<b>                               BATMAN\n</b><b>               VICKI!\n</b>\n     An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG.  Clean\n     hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down\n     across the rocks.\n\n     With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath\n     and VAULTS toward the CATWALK.  She's a foot short; she grabs\n     hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to\n     pull herself up.  BATMAN races toward her --\n\n     -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky\n     outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN.  The BATS\n     have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the\n     cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.\n\n     THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first\n     shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward.  As the second\n     spins him around.  As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE\n<b>     RAILING.\n</b>\n     VICKI screams.  BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.\n     Now <u>two</u> of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks\n     -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.\n\n     The ECHOES are cacophanous.  ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the\n     vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly\n     projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor.  And then --\n\n     BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS\n     IT.  It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet.  He stares\n     down at it, and two beats later --\n\n     -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE.  Within\n     moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON\n     THE SIGNAL.  The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming.  A CHOKED\n     WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands\n     there, PARALYZED.\n\n     <u>He's just been beaten at his own game</u>.  He lets out a last\n     awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --\n\n     -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream\n     dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...\n\n     BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk.  He rushes\n     over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her\n     protectively.  Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant\n     perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet.  They embrace\n     on the edge of the abyss.\n\n     On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED.  The\n     butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,\n     clutching his wounded arm.  DICK slings an arm around him and\n     helps him to the stairway.\n\n                                                            <b>CUT TO:</b>\n\n     <u><b>EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     SQUAD CARS everywhere.  FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,\n     flanked by COPS.  PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious\n     SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an\n     ambulance.\n\n     <u><b>INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     The place is an utter mess.  Amid the carnage we find BRUCE\n     conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK.  In b.g.,\n     a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.\n\n<b>                               GORDON\n</b>               ...and then Batman showed up?\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               He saved all our lives, Jim.

Who's the\n               kid?\n\n     BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are\n     righting the fallen Christmas tree.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.

Good luck\n               cleaning this place up.\n\n     GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.\n     BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front\n     parlor.\n\n     <u><b>INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT</b></u>\n\n     ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD.  VICKI ambles up to\n<b>     BRUCE:\n</b>\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               What are you going to do with all that\n               gold?\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               I dunno.

DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they\n     blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.\n\n<b>                               VICKI\n</b>               It's Christmas.\n\n<b>                               BRUCE\n</b>               Yeah.

She unwraps it, opens it slowly\n     -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.\n\n     She gazes up at him, speechless.  He gazes back.\n\n     CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the\n     devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling\n     into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;\n     ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.\n     And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we\n\n                                                          <b>FADE OUT.</b>\n\n\n\n                                <u><b>THE END</b></u>\n\n\n\n\n   </is></vigilantes></pre>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Batman 2</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Sam Hamm\" title=\"Scripts by Sam Hamm\">Sam Hamm</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Batman 2 Script.html#comments\" title=\"Batman 2 comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:59:55.941288"}
