VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at\n               the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --\n\n                                   SUE\n                         I can only stay for one drink, Ben. \n                         I've got to meet with Victor.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.\n\n               They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Hey Reed, what are you doing here?\n                             (before he can answer)\n                         Great, why don't you join us?\n\n               He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. \n               Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the\n                         buffet.\n\n               Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING\n\n               The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The\n               room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp\n               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Pardon me...\n\n               Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Are you alright?\n\n                                   BEN\n                         I think I need to lie down.  Bad\n                         shrimp.\n\n               This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,\n               unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Really bad shrimp.\n\n               ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. \n               A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this\n               woman.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Feeling better?\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Yes, thanks.\n\n                                   REED\n                         That's good.

Exasperated, Reed tries to think of\n               something, anything, to say.\n\n                                   REED\n                         I'm really happy for you and Victor.\n\n               She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         You're happy for me and Victor.\n\n                                   REED\n                         I can tell you guys are enjoying what\n                         was the best part of our relationship --\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Which was?\n\n                                   REED\n                         Passion.\n\n               We see surprise on Sue's face, and...\n\n                                   REED (CONT'D)\n                         For science.\n\n                                   SUE\n                             (frustrated)\n                         You are such a dork, Reed... You never\n                         got it and never will unless it's\n                         explained to you in quantum physics.\n\n               As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around\n               her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.\n\n                                   REED\n                         What?  What did I say?\n\n               She looks more disappointed than angry.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         It's never what you say.  It's what\n                         you don't say. What you don't do...\n\n               She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --\n               she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.\n\n                                   REED\n                         I...I...I just wanted to --\n\n               As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         It's been two years, and all you can\n                         say is you're happy for me and some\n                         other guy...\n                             (standing up, hurt)\n                         You know, Victor may be a lot of\n                         things, but at least he's not afraid\n                         to fight for what he wants...\n                             (Reed looks down)\n                         And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. \n                         To be heard...seen... Reed, look at\n                         me.\n\n               He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her\n               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Uh, Sue...?  I can't.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         What?  What do you mean you --\n\n                                   REED\n                         Sue...look at your hands.\n\n               She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a\n               medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her\n               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.\n\n               Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a\n               GLASS off the table...\n\n               SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed\n               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two\n               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- \n\n               Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in\n               disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue\n               reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.\n\n                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)\n                         You guys will not believe what just\n                         happened!\n\n               They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for\n               the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING\n\n               CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides\n               out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair\n               to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He\n               PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. \n\n               It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor\n               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. \n               Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING\n\n               DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently\n               walk.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         It has to be the cloud.

He stares.  Sue follows his\n               gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his\n               fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Now what is up with that?\n\n                                   REED\n                             (deadpan)\n                         The cloud has fundamentally altered\n                         our DNA.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Cool.

VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive\n               bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the \"CLAPPER.\"\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Flame on, flame off.

Johnny smiles.\n\n                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)\n                         Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my\n                         nurse!\n\n               INT.

SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.\n\n                                   SUE (O.S.)\n                         Open up Ben, we need to talk.\n\n               It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way\n               and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in\n               pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:\n\n                                   BEN\n                         LEAVE ME ALONE!!!\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the\n               floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...\n               Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE\n               DOORJAMB.\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping\n               clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers\n               find the latch and unlock the door.\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the\n               door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones\n               reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.\n\n               They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.\n\n               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of\n               furniture smashed to splinters.\n\n                                   REED\n                         ...Ben?\n\n               Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used\n               to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING\n               LARGE in the distance, running away.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         What is that thing?\n\n                                   SUE\n                         I think that thing is Ben.\n\n               Reed looks out, emotions roiling.

TRAIN YARD - NIGHT\n\n               A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. \n               CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo\n               trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...\n\n               A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide\n               open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or\n               someTHING barrels into the night.\n\n               EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT\n\n               A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking\n               glass.\n\n               INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT\n\n               SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,\n               shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.\n\n               EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT\n\n               A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.\n\n               CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but\n               they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more\n               and more frustrated.  He manages to press \"0\" with his pinky.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Hello, Operator?\n\n               Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a\n               modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees\n               Debbie grab the phone.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Deb... It's me.

There is \"WELCOME HOME\" sign over the\n               door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something\n               shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.\n\n                                   DEBBIE\n                         Ben?\n\n                                   BEN (O.S.)\n                         Don't come any closer for a sec.  This\n                         is gonna be kind of a shock... You\n                         remember when we said \"together\n                         forever no matter what\"?\n\n                                   DEBBIE\n                         Baby, you're scaring me.\n\n               A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE\n               HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he\n               once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.\n\n               Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to\n               think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches\n               back.\n\n                                   DEBBIE\n                         Oh my G-g-g.

It's too much for her.  Tears\n               swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.\n\n               He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over\n               her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a\n               halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries\n               back.\n\n                                   DEBBIE\n                         Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!\n\n               Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he\n               has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time\n               he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         I love you, Deb.\n\n               With that, he turns away.  The \"WELCOME HOME\" sign flutters,\n               falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on\n               around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.\n\n               INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: \"VDM\" emblazoned\n               on a gold plate.

Think bigger.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above\n               the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of\n               the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,\n               muttering.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         A few days in space, it'll be great,\n                         what's the worst that could happen?\n\n               A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on\n               his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Perfect.  Thanks.\n\n               He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a\n               distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his\n               case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.\n\n               The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben\n               (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         You think you got trouble?  Take a\n                         good look, pal, how bad could it be?\n\n               The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Okay, easy there, buddy.\n\n               Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His\n               arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight\n               while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks\n               SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         You had to choose my spot, didn't you?\n\n               Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The\n               Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing\n               hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point. \n\n               Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK\n               bearing down on the Businessman.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         This is really not my day.\n\n               Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the\n               Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and\n               turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.\n\n               The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,\n               but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little\n               scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...\n\n               SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The\n               truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to\n               the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.\n\n               The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. \n               CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A\n               FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker. \n               One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.\n\n               EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n               Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action\n               on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the\n               destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped\n               in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.\n\n               He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the\n               airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab\n               the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         A little help here?!  You wanna hit\n                         that button, sir?\n\n               The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button. \n               Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE\n               DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner. \n               They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.\n\n                                   COP\n                         FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT\n                         DOWN!\n\n               Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He\n               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man\n               in hand.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY\n\n               At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The\n               whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH\n               TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...\n\n               REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to\n               see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Not even Ben deserves that.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges\n               behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them\n               back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.\n\n               He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on\n               walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING\n               MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY\n\n               Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other\n               people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

Not thrilled with the idea.  She\n               wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She\n               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses\n               concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her\n               undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. \n\n               The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of\n               bricks.  Cops are transfixed.

Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing\n               happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.\n\n                                   SUE (CONT'D)\n                         Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you\n                         should strip down next, see how it\n                         feels to have fifty people staring --\n\n               ...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.

They turn to\n               look at Reed, astonished.

BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY\n\n               Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big\n               TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!\n\n               He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! \n               His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         What the --!\n\n                                   REED\n                         Ben.

Then to his own body:\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause\n                         I sure ain't Ben anymore.\n\n               Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.\n\n                                   SUE (O.S.)\n                         REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!\n\n               Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does\n               see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!\n\n               BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty\n               cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! \n\n               Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms\n               FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.\n\n               FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. \n               Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving\n               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,\n               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks\n               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.\n\n               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The\n               air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.\n\n               She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields\n               SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames\n               hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from\n               her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... \n\n               Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE\n               FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast\n               deflects off the street and into...\n\n               An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF\n               THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail\n               slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.\n\n               THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE\n               WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck\n               TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the\n               front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!\n\n               He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across\n               the concrete, digging grooves into the street.\n\n               ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward\n               the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down\n               at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The\n               HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!\n\n               Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! \n               His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. \n               Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,\n               painful.\n\n               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. \n               His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the\n               truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing\n               over Ben.\n\n               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps\n               back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary\n               cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...\n\n               The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers\n               joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,\n               touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. \n\n               Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;\n               he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps\n               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places\n               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.\n\n               Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over\n               to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip\n               it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And... \n\n               A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.\n\n                                   REED\n                         I swear to you, I will do everything\n                         in my power until there is not a\n                         breath left in me: you are going to be\n                         Ben again.\n\n               Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...\n\n               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV. \n               ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new\n               Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic\n               pose.

And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it\n               hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his\n               hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.\n\n               EXT./INT.

VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter\n               Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on\n               monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved\n               hand.\n\n               A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.\n\n                                   LEONARD\n                         Is Reed any closer to a cure?\n\n               Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         The only thing he's closer to is\n                         Sue...\n\n               But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. \n               He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to\n               his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:\n\n               REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's\n               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.\n\n                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)\n                         Make me a reservation for two at\n                         Cipriani tonight.\n\n               Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.\n\n                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)\n                         And get this over to Ben Grimm.\n\n               Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets\n               closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at\n               his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.\n\n                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                         Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em\n                         closed.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN\n               GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.\n\n                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                         You surprised?\n\n               Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The\n               Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old\n               life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.\n\n                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)\n                         Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the\n                         fire department didn't shut this down.\n\n               ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a\n               SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. \n               On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.\n\n                                   THE THING\n                         God.  I was good looking.\n\n               We hear the party sing \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY.\"  Debbie kisses Ben. \n               Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out\n               candles.\n\n                                   DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)\n                         What did you wish for, honey?\n\n                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)\n                         I already got it.  Everything I want.\n\n               As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,\n               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT\n\n               Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. \n               As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:\n\n               REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is\n               STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just\n               shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... \n\n               UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The\n               muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... \n\n               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in\n               his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. \n               His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his\n               skin.\n\n                                   VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Damn, Stretch!\n\n               Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         How far's that rubber bend?\n\n               Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.\n\n                                   REED\n                         That's what I'm trying to calculate. \n                         And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,\n                         tendon.  I seem to have the ability to\n                         manipulate the malleability of my\n                         molecular structure and redistribute\n                         my density to --\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Right, whatever, have fun.\n\n               And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts\n               to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a\n               TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready\n               to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the\n               games:\n\n               Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought\n               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.\n\n               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT\n\n               A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. \n               Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A\n               shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a\n               classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. \n               Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes\n               through the door into --\n\n               INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT\n\n               A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a\n               place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He\n               moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.\n\n               Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! \n               The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. \n               Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         That's not funny!\n\n               They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,\n               scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.\n\n                                   ERNIE\n                         Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first\n                         mook from Brooklyn to go to outer\n                         space, so pay him some respect!\n\n               But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Ernie.  Sorry for killing your\n                         business.  I'll take the usual, then\n                         I'm out... Better make it a double.\n\n               Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his\n               head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the\n               bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA\n               MASTERS.\n\n                                   ALICIA\n                         Who killed the party?\n\n               She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack\n               of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.\n\n                                   ERNIE (O.S.)\n                         Make it a triple.  On the house,\n                         Benny.\n\n               Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,\n               spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         If there's a God, she hates me.\n\n               He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.\n\n                                   ALICIA\n                         I don't think She's real big on hate.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         You wouldn't say that, if you could\n                         see me.\n\n               She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.\n\n                                   ALICIA\n                         Can I...?  See you...?\n\n               Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.\n\n                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)\n                         It's okay, I won't bite...\n                             (feeling his arm)\n                         ...not that I could.\n\n               She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and\n               gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.\n\n                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)\n                         Such a sad face... You know, sometimes\n                         being different isn't a bad thing.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Trust me, this ain't one of those\n                         times.\n\n               She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.\n\n                                   ALICIA\n                         See you round, Benny...\n\n               Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --\n\n                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)\n                         I'm Alicia, by the way.\n\n               Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He\n               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new\n               drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.\n\n               EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n               Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs. \n               Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...\n               Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing\n               gloves.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         Thank you for coming out to see me.\n\n               She nods, a little self-conscious.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         You said it was urgent.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         It is.

Something I need to ask\n                         you...\n\n               Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.\n\n                                   SUE\n                             (slow, careful)\n                         Victor, wait, slow down a second.

Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor\n               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.\n\n                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)\n                         Don't forget who you work for, Susan. \n                         So get to work.  And do your job.\n\n               He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out\n               of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the\n               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.\n\n               Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. \n               She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT\n               through the air.

The man's wine SPILLS into\n               his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing. \n               Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH\n               INTO --\n\n               EXT.

He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He\n               beelines to RONNIE RENNER.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Hey, Ronnie Renner!

He leans over his handlebars.\n\n                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\n                         He's going for a Kiss of Death!\n\n               Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING\n               STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...\n               \n               JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to\n               streak off his back!

He FLAMES ON, spiraling\n               upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.\n\n                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\n                             (hand over mic)\n                         Is he......flying?\n\n               A beat.

Johnny\n               swerves to a stop, with a \"holy shit\" look on his face.  What\n               the hell just happened??\n\n                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\n                         Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! \n                         You've just seen the first...the\n                         first...TORCHFLIGHT!

Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO\n               REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's\n               fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. \n\n               BAM!

He\n               leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.\n\n               The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. \n\n               Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck\n               begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he\n               stands.  Heating up.

Victor is the lone\n               man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage\n               palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his\n               body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.\n\n               INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY\n\n               After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in\n               every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,\n               heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start\n               to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by\n               one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.

A surge of electricity courses through Victor. \n               His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to\n               THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...\n\n               ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING\n               LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric\n               snakes), heading straight for Ned.

It's time for\n                         action.  My men could have mass-\n                         produced this by now.\n\n               Reed shakes his head, defending himself.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Mass-produced?  This isn't a\n                         toaster.  You have no idea how it\n                         works.\n\n               Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the\n               intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.

I've got the same Phd you\n                         do.\n\n               Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with\n               his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.\n\n                                   REED\n                         The storm needs to be handled exactly\n                         right, or it could make our mutations\n                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill\n                         us...\n\n               Victor slows.

BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY\n\n               Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,\n               mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE\n               GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.\n\n                                   LITTLE GIRL\n                         Mister, Mister!  Please help me!

Considers climbing the tree,\n               but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...\n\n               Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap\n               out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!\n\n               The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks\n               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands\n               the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. \n               He just moves on.\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE\n               SCULPTURE of his bust.\n\n               He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely\n               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the\n               haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,\n               but...\n\n                                   BEN\n                             (under breath)\n                         Eyebrows are a little big...\n\n               A beat.

Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look\n                         up.\n\n               He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.\n\n                                   SUE (CONT'D)\n                         Remember our first date here...?  God,\n                         I was so nervous.\n\n                                   REED\n                         You were?\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Of course I was.  I'd read all your\n                         papers on bioethics.  Some of them two\n                         times just so I'd have something to\n                         say to you.\n\n               Reed smiles softly, thinking back.\n\n                                   REED\n                         You know, I bribed the projectionist\n                         ten bucks to keep it open late?\n\n                                   SUE\n                         I gave him twenty.\n\n               They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:\n\n                                   SUE (CONT'D)\n                         I didn't want that night to end.\n\n               Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:\n\n                                   REED\n                         Sue, you were right.  It wasn't\n                         complicated.  I just wasn't ready to\n                         be...to become...\n                             (a beat)\n                         You can be a little intimidating. \n\n               She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.\n\n                                   REED (CONT'D)\n                         You always talked about how you liked\n                         the kind of man who could approach\n                         you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't\n                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted\n                         you to be that man.\n\n               Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.\n\n                                   SUE (CONT'D)\n                         When I walked out, I waited ten\n                         minutes outside your door.  Ten. \n                         Waiting for you to come find me.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Why didn't you say something?\n\n                                   SUE\n                         That would have kinda defeated the\n                         purpose.  And Reed...\n                             (closer, emotional)\n                         I'm saying it now.\n\n               Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their\n               faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue\n               disappears.\n\n                                   SUE (CONT'D)\n                             (quiet, playful)\n                         Come find me.\n\n               Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...\n\n                                   SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n                         That's my nose, genius... These are my\n                         lips.\n\n               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible\n               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,\n               tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --\n\n               EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT\n\n               Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. \n               A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips\n               her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.\n\n                                   ALICIA\n                         Look around.  I'll get us drinks. \n                         They always let blind girls cut the\n                         line.\n\n               She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. \n               The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is\n               the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling\n               hard.\n\n               Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained\n               smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. \n               He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.\n               \n               Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,\n               thinking he's just an inanimate statue.\n\n                                   PATRON\n                         I don't know about this one.  It lacks\n                         a certain...realism.\n\n               Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN\n               GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.\n\n                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1\n                         She's always had a thing for runaways\n                         and strays, but this is ridiculous.\n\n                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #2\n                         I know.  Did she really think these\n                         sculptures would sell?\n\n                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1\n                         Like anybody would want this thing in\n                         their house.  That girl's a one-woman\n                         charity.\n\n               Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the\n               room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He\n               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten\n               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. \n\n               We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging\n               where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for\n               him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his\n               heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. \n\n               THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --\n\n               EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT\n\n               A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN\n               sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. \n               Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a\n               metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...\n\n                                   VICTOR (O.S.)\n                         This seat taken?\n\n               Ben turns to see...VICTOR.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         I'm worried about you.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         About me?  How sweet.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         Come on.  Let me buy you something to\n                         eat.  Looks like you could use the\n                         company.\n\n               Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.\n\n               INT. DINER - LATER\n\n               Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a\n               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge\n               plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other\n               customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles\n               the plates.\n\n                                   THE THING\n                         'Scuse me.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't\n                         changed that much for Reed, Sue and\n                         Johnny.  At least they can go out in\n                         public.  But for you?  People staring.\n                         Whispering behind your back...\n\n                                   THE THING\n                         If you're trying to cheer me up you're\n                         doing a helluva job --\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         I'm just saying, I know what it's like\n                         to lose something you love.  To see it\n                         slip away, and know it's never coming\n                         back.\n\n               The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.\n\n                                   THE THING\n                         Reed's gonna fix me up --\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         For your sake I hope you're right. \n                         I'm sorry if that sounds a little\n                         skeptical.\n\n                                   THE THING\n                         Skeptical...?\n\n               Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure\n               points.\n\n                                   VICTOR\n                         Look, he's a brilliant man, we should\n                         trust he's working as hard as he can. \n                         You're his best friend.  So what\n                         possible reason could he have for\n                         taking his time?\n                             (a beat)\n                         I mean, other than getting close to\n                         Sue?\n\n               Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't\n               help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT\n\n               Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed\n               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He\n               sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Yeah, I have that effect on people.\n\n               The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. \n               The Technicians are gone now.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Ben --\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Oh, you remember my name do you?

Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!\n\n               He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He\n               THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.\n\n                                   REED\n                         I am looking.  That's why I can't make\n                         a mistake!

For\n                         what?  So you could play Twister with\n                         your girlfriend while I'm the freak of\n                         the week?\n\n               Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams\n               into the wall, and stays down this time.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Ben!  Stop it!

They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall\n               to shake Reed.

This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens\n               flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull\n               back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.

With his other\n               hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches\n               from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Hey!

We follow them to:\n\n               A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. \n               He's surrounded by \"groupies\" climbing over each other to get\n               a look at his various parlour tricks.\n\n               He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.

As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in\n               the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls\n               faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --\n\n               -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both\n               hands...and WHHHM!

MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT\n\n               The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie\n               glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of\n               the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim\n               slightly.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\n\n               Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,\n               we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that\n               someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,\n               straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME\n\n               Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights\n               dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...\n\n               EXT. CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. \n               He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes\n               where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT\n\n               INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,\n               crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as\n               the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. \n\n               And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It\n               still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES\n               OPEN.\n\n               Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more\n               rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. \n\n               He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He\n               collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK\n                         YOU...VIC?!\n\n               Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...\n\n               VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to\n               Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part\n               flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.\n\n               HE IS DOOM.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Vic...

It worked perfectly. \n\n               Ben starts to realize...\n\n                                   BEN\n                         You planned this...?\n\n               Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from\n               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         I've always wanted power.

This is what a\n                         man looks like who embraces his\n                         destiny.\n\n               Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying\n               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         One down, three to go.\n\n               Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. \n               Doom steps back into the shadows.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         Right on cue.\n\n               Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Oh god Ben.

I did.\n\n               Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Victor...?

And\n                         outsmarted the great Reed Richards --\n\n                                   REED\n                         Victor, this isn't the way to --\n\n                                   DOOM\n                             (a dark smile)\n                         You always know best.  So tell me. \n                         What happens when you superheat\n                         rubber?\n\n               Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through\n               the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.\n\n               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.\n\n               INT.

BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n               DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our\n               friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.\n\n                                   O'HOOLIHAN\n                         Mr. Von Doom?

BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali\n               watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't\n               get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a\n               SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.\n\n               He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches\n               Reed's face, holds it close.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Why the long face?\n\n               Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,\n               horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...\n\n               Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic\n               veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with\n               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.\n\n               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT\n\n               Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,\n               seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. \n               Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.

VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to\n               the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows. \n               He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face. \n\n               Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Chemistry 101, Part Two.

Ultra-cold vapor\n               coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.\n\n               Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         Allow me.\n\n               He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a\n               horrific CRACKING SOUND.

As he moves, the missile SHIFTS\n               slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.\n\n               He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the\n               MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Great.

Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He\n               hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom\n               even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. \n               And...\n\n               A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being\n               manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next\n               to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         What has he done to you?\n\n               Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.\n\n                                   DOOM (O.S.)\n                         How romantic.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Victor, please --\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         It's Doctor Doom to you.\n\n               He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         We know the machine works.  It worked\n                         on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can\n                         turn you back --\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Do you really think fate turned us\n                         into gods so we could refuse these\n                         gifts?\n\n               She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Victor.  You always thought you were\n                         god.\n\n               Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Sue please, let's not fight.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         No, Victor... Let's.\n\n               She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him\n               back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. \n               Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Susan...... You're fired.\n\n               BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. \n               She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING\n               to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her\n               strength to...GO INVISIBLE.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         Marco...\n\n               A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         Polo.\n\n               He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to\n               the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.\n\n               In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and\n               out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through\n               the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?\n\n               EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT\n\n               Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet\n               behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:\n\n               A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,\n               Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. \n               VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.\n\n               He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes\n               in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- \n\n               JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles\n               through the air, we CUT BACK TO --\n\n               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. \n               Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.\n\n               Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes\n               every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes\n               a CRACCCKKKKING sound.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         One more down.  Now it's just the\n                         scientist and his specimen.\n\n               Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He\n               has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips\n               and get the words out.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Sue.  The only thing I ever knew\n                         without thinking was...\n                             (his lips fully freezing)\n                         I...love...\n\n               He starts to say \"you,\" but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue\n               whispers to him:\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Me too, Reed.\n\n               Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                             (quiet, cruel)\n                         And so four became none.  It's my time\n                         now.\n\n               BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!\n\n                                   VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Actually, Vic...\n\n               Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... \n\n               BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!\n\n               Doom turns, just as --\n\n               BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever\n               been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward\n               the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive \"V\"\n               sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then\n               nothing.\n\n               Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.\n\n               Ben turns to Reed.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                         Damn, I've been wanting to do that.\n\n               Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting\n               the tubes from Reed.\n\n                                   BEN (CONT'D)\n                             (Reed's words)\n                         Victor's \"not that bad,\" huh?  Just \"a\n                         little larger than life\"?  Maybe\n                         you'll listen to me next time before --\n\n               WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. \n               He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben\n               charges back.  And these two behemoths...\n\n               SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!\n\n               EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,\n               PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through\n               the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.\n\n               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the\n               glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.\n\n               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT\n\n               UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight\n               CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater\n               through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...\n\n               The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! \n               WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy\n               holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --\n\n               INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids\n               head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,\n               turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as\n               the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --\n\n               EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the\n               TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --\n\n               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n               CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a\n               large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING\n               from the inside.  Grunts, growls.\n\n               CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,\n               sirens screaming.  And --\n\n               BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben\n               lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks\n               the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water\n               flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. \n\n               Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with\n               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.\n\n               EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. \n               He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your\n                         car?\n\n               She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.\n\n                                   OLD LADY\n                         The clutch sticks a little.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Not gonna be a problem.\n\n               Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES\n               through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back\n               twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --\n\n               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\n               BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! \n               Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,\n               snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.\n\n               Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY\n               POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a\n               giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- \n\n               BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes\n               FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --\n\n               WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! \n               Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.\n\n               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME\n\n               On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom\n               strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the\n               death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --\n\n                                   VOICE (O.S.)\n                         I can't let you do that.\n\n               Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised\n               and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         And you can't stop me.\n\n               He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING\n               DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.\n\n               Something invisible.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         Hello Susan.\n\n               She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. \n               Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It\n               skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.\n\n               Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.\n\n                                   DOOM (CONT'D)\n                         What is this?  The pitiful three?\n\n               Doom steps toward them, but --\n\n                                   VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Four.\n\n               WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a\n               flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.\n\n               Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of\n               them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Had a little relapse, huh?\n\n               Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.\n\n                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)\n                         Welcome back.\n\n               They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed\n               and melted, making him look all the more menacing.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         This is going to be fun.\n\n               Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at\n               the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a\n               thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!\n\n               He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He\n               holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in\n               buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. \n\n               He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of\n               control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires\n               SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:\n\n               Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. \n\n               Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges\n               surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --\n\n               Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-\n               flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize\n               fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field\n               and --\n\n               SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar\n               starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! \n               They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- \n\n               Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is\n               holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas\n               holding the world.  People run out, safe.\n\n               ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.\n\n                                   REED\n                         JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!\n\n               Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the\n               wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. \n\n               Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The\n               impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Can't...hold...on...\n\n               Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,\n               vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! \n\n               He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he\n               forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.\n\n               Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,\n               RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without\n               breaking.  He strains, agonizing.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Johnny.

Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,\n               which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed\n               doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,\n                         frustration --\n\n                                   SUE\n                             (looking at Doom)\n                         I'm sure I can come up with something.\n\n               She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and\n               the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.\n\n               Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER\n               BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which\n               WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). \n\n               Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.\n               Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it\n               in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the\n               point that it's blinding.  People look away.\n\n               Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the\n               ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her\n               knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As\n               everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --\n\n               DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body\n               GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look\n               devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         Is that the best you can do...?  A\n                         little heat...?\n\n               Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Time for your lesson, Vic.

The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben\n               kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays\n               toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...\n\n               The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and\n               SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!\n\n                                   DOOM\n                         No.\n\n               Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING\n               DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling\n               metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. \n\n               The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely\n               obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to\n               reveal:\n\n               DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of\n               METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The\n               Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling\n               smoke.  A beat.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Damn, I love this job.\n\n               Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Job, huh...?\n\n               Will they accept their mantle?

Sue gets close to Reed.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         You know, about what we said up there,\n                         I think maybe --\n\n               THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful. \n               He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in\n               him.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?\n\n               Sue looks at Reed.

The sun\n               rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn\n               of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --\n\n               INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK\n\n               Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs\n               around New York City.\n\n                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)\n                         Dude, that's still my sister.\n\n               A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the\n               crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),\n               bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed\n               and Sue.\n\n               Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Ben, I've been crunching the numbers\n                         on the machine.

He\n               CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.\n\n                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)\n                         We're going to have to work on your\n                         touch.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         I like the sound of that.\n\n               Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.\n\n                                   REED\n                         Sue, can I talk to you for a second?\n\n               Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.\n\n               EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK\n\n               A romantic view of the city-scape.

Reed, we're at a party.\n\n               He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just\n               about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.\n\n                                   REED\n                         If one of us were to wear it...\n\n               She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. \n\n               Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.\n\n                                   SUE\n                         Reed.  What are you doing?\n\n               Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his\n               body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.\n\n                                   REED\n                         No more thinking, no more variables...\n                         Sue Storm...will you...\n                             (she's gone)\n                         Sue?

SUE IS WEARING IT.\n\n                                   SUE (V.O.)\n                         Yes.\n\n               Reed goes to kiss her.\n\n                                   SUE (V.O.)

These are my\n                         lips.\n\n               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible\n               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.\n\n               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move\n               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --\n\n                                   BEN\n                         No more cracks about how I look.\n\n                                   JOHNNY\n                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.\n                             (weaving around bodies)\n                         Clear the way, wide load coming\n                         through.\n\n               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as\n               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the\n               air, blazing the NUMBER \"FOUR\" enclosed in a circle of flame\n               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd\n               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.\n\n                                   BEN\n                         Showoff.\n\n               People drink, laugh, dance.

He is placed in a wooden\n               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his\n               cell.\n\n               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of\n               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes\n               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --\n\n               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through\n               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal\n               the box is on the deck of:\n\n               A FREIGHTER SHIP.
