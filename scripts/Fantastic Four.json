His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving\n               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,\n               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks\n               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.\n\n               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).

Epic,\n               painful.\n\n               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. \n               His footsteps THUD.

Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing\n               over Ben.\n\n               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.

Reed moves fast:\n\n               He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,\n               pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND! \n\n               Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more\n               closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped\n               around her.  A heated beat.

Finally, we reach... \n\n               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in\n               his other hand, measuring distance.

Aware of people staring, laughing.  He\n               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten\n               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.

These are my\n                         lips.\n\n               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible\n               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.\n\n               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move\n               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --\n\n<b>                                   BEN\n</b>                         No more cracks about how I look.\n\n<b>                                   JOHNNY\n</b>                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.\n                             (weaving around bodies)\n                         Clear the way, wide load coming\n                         through.\n\n               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as\n               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the\n               air, blazing the NUMBER \"FOUR\" enclosed in a circle of flame\n               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd\n               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.\n\n<b>                                   BEN\n</b>                         Showoff.\n\n               People drink, laugh, dance.

He is placed in a wooden\n               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his\n               cell.\n\n               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of\n               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes\n               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --\n\n               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through\n               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal\n               the box is on the deck of:\n\n               A FREIGHTER SHIP.
