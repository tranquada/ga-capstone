A black *65 Ford Mustang, min t\n     condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yard s past the dog ,\n     and back s up . Th e dog raises its head.\n\n\n\n    Two me n step out of the car.

He looks down. A\n crumpled soda can lies by his feet. He kicks the can.\n The dog's head pivots to follow the aluminum flash.\n Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward,\n wrapping his arms around the dog's midsection. The dog\n growls, bites the wool, tries to break the blanket's neck.\n Monty lurches toward the Mustang, struggling to retain his\n bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp. As they\n stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and\n snaps at Monty's throat.\nMonty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid.

There is\n     something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his\n     lip.\n    One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her\n    desk, reading from a poetry textbook.

MONTY'S BUILDING -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\nA four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville.\nNATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book.\nNaturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a\nrunner.

MONTY'S APARTMENT\n\n     Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle,\n     then locks it. There are five locks and a heavy steel\n     deadbolt.\n     Despite the ominous security, it's a nice one-bedroom\n     apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the\n     brownstones across the street.\n     Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the\n     Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest\n     photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar.\n     Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep.\n     Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the\n     remote.\n\n                         WEATHERMAN\n\n               The first major storm of winter is\n               heading our way --\n     Monty turns off the television.

A \"B\" for Brogan is tooled into\n    the leather, stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers' logo.\n    A .40 caliber automatic, squat and black, rests in the\n    holster. Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and\n    runs his fingers over the B.

She\n    stretches back, lifting one leg out of the bath.\n    He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops, looking at\n    the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle.

ELEUTHERIA GREEK RESTAURANT -- NIGHT\n\n\n\n\n     UNCLE BLUE, SENKA VALGHOBEK, and VICTOR GEDNY sit on the\n     private balcony that overlooks the restaurant's mai n room.\n\n\n\n     The place is furnished in classic Outer Borough Greek\n     fashion: whitewashed walls , clay-tiled floors, poster s of the\n     Parthenon at dawn and Santorini at sunset.\n\n\n\n    Uncle Blue owns the place . He's a fierce-looking ma n with a\n    thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for\n    incompetence. It's hard to determine his age -- anywhere from\n    forty to sixty.\n    Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an\n    overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is\n    something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meannes s\n    around his eyes. He's in his late forties.\n    Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit,\n    a gold bracelet, and a deep , artificial-looking tan .\n    Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two\n    watch him. Gedny gestures toward the windows.\n\n                        GEDNY\n\n              Starting to snow.\n\n                         UNCLE BLUE\n\n              You met with Brogan this morning.            \u00b7\u00b7-\n    Uncle Blue's accent, like his age, is difficult to pi n down.\n    He could be Afghani or Iranian or Turkish.\n\n\n\n\n                        GEDNY\n\n              I did, yeah.\n\n\n\n    Gedny reaches for his wine , takes a sip.\n\n\n\n\n                         UNCLE BLUE\n\n              And?\n\n\n\n\n                          GEDNY\n\n              He' s no t lovin g lif e righ t now,\n              obviously .

We hear the old engine wheezing.\nCLOSE on Monty's ravaged face, on his eyelids.\nMr. Brogan keeps talking and New York City melts away.\n\n                     MR.

Mr. Brogan and Monty (his face\n unmarred) step out of the car.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n INT. TOWN BAR -- DAY\n\n Mr. Brogan and Monty are sitting at a corner table. Mr .\n Brogan raises his glass of whiskey to Monty and both men\n drink.\n\n                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n           Find a bar, and I'll buy us drinks. I\n           haven't had a drink in nineteen years,\n           but I'll have one with you. And then I'll\n           leave.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\nMonty stands at the window of the bar, watching Mr. Brogan\ndrive away.\n\n                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n\n          I'll tell you don't ever write me, don't\n          ever come visit. I'll tell you I believe\n          in God's Kingdom and I believe I'll be\n          with you again, and your mother. But not\n          in this lifetime.\nMonty approaches the BARTENDER, a powerfully-built older man\n(60). Monty speaks and the bartender listens carefully, but\nwe don't hear the dialogue.\n\n                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n\n          You get a job somewhere, a job that pays\n          cash, a boss who doesn't ask questions,\n          and you make a new life, and you never\n          come back.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n\nINT. TOWN BAR -- NIGHT\n\nMonty works behind the bar on a crowded night. The bar\nPATRONS, a blue-collar rural crowd, are rowdy drinkers, but\nMonty works efficiently, quickly filling their orders.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                              116,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  INT. HEAD SHOP -- NIGHT\n\n Monty, in the backroom of a seedy head shop, sits for a\n photograph in front of a black drop.\n\n                      MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n            You find the right people and you get\n            yourself papers, a driver's license.\n\n EXT. TOWN BAR -- DAY\n\n Monty sits on the steps in back of the bar, looking out past\n the gravel lot toward the distant mountains.\n\n                      MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n           And then you wait. People get caught when\n           they come home. But you're never coming\n           home.\n\n EXT. BUS STATION -- DAY\n\n Monty, a few years older, waits as a Greyhound bus pulls into\n the station.\n\n                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n           And maybe -- and this is dangerous-- but\n           maybe after a couple years you send word\n           to Naturelle.\nNaturelle steps off the Greyhound bus. She sees Monty. They\nstare at each other, twenty feet apart.\nFinally he goes to her, threading through the other\ntravellers, the other waiting families. He takes her in his\narms.\n\nINT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\nIn the cramped apartment above the bar where Monty works,\nMonty and Naturelle sit together, on a sofa, watching a small\ntelevision. Naturelle is pregnant.\nThe ball is about to drop in Times Square.\n\n                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n          You forget about New York. You can't come\n          back. You can't call, you can't write.\n\nINT. SMALL HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\nMonty, much older now, stands in front of his family, his\ngrown CHILDREN and the little GRANDCHILDREN. Naturelle,\nequally aged, sits with one of the little girls on her lap.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                            117\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)\n\n          And maybe one day, years from now, long\n          after I'm dead and gone, you gather your\n          whole family together and you tell them\n          the truth. Who you are and where you came\n          from.\nAs Monty speaks his children exchange glances. They can't\nreally believe what they're hearing, but they know their\nfather is telling the truth.\n\n                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n\n          You tell them the whole thing. And then\n          you ask them if they know how lucky they\n          are to be there.\nMonty looks at his family. He is awed by their existence, by\nthe life he has created. He looks at Naturelle, still\nbeautiful in old age, and she smiles back at him.\n\n                    OLD MONTY\n\n          It all came so close to never happening.\n\nINT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING\n\nThe sun shines through the windshield.
