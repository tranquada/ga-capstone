There are five locks and a heavy steel\n<br/>     deadbolt.\n<br/>     Despite the ominous security, it's a nice one-bedroom\n<br/>     apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the\n<br/>     brownstones across the street.\n<br/>     Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the\n<br/>     Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest\n<br/>     photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar.\n<br/>     Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep.\n<br/>     Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the\n<br/>     remote.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>                         WEATHERMAN\n<br/></b>\n<br/>               The first major storm of winter is\n<br/>               heading our way --\n<br/>     Monty turns off the television.
