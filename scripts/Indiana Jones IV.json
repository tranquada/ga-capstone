A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the\n        fly, deciding whether or not to bite.\n\n        CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We\n        PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.\n        A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN\n        FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a\n        blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its\n        brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.\n\n        It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,\n        surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the\n        entire area.\n\n<b>        TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.\n</b>\n        Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole\n        BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.\n        CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA\n        JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his\n        catch.\n\n        A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN (O.S.)\n</b>                        Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...\n\n        Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the\n        line.\n\n<b>        INDIANA'S POV\n</b>\n        Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are\n        being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are\n        gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by\n        INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,\n        bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.\n        MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        We need your assistance!\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                                (struggling with the\n                                fishing line)\n                        C'mon, Mac...

It's very importantl...\n\n        Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience\n        prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back\n        to shore.\n\n<b>        THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER\n</b>\n        NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the\n        Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the\n        foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...\n        their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends\n        an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes\n        the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.\n\n        An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES\n        to MacGowan.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Do you value our friendship, Mac?\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        More than me' nightly pint.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Then this better not be some wild\n                        goose chase...\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        T'ain't wild geese we're after,\n                        Doctor Jones.

One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON\n        something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.\n\n        A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,\n        as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face\n        is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.\n        The villagers WHISPER among themselves.\n\n<b>                                        YOUNG MAN\n</b>                        Scotty Ferguson.\n\n<b>                                        OLD WOMAN\n</b>                        He's the eighth.\n\n<b>                                        MAN\n</b>                        Just like the others...all his bones\n                        busted...crushed...\n\n<b>                                        OLD MAN\n</b>                        Whatever's killin' people around\n                        here ain't human.\n\n<b>                                        WOMAN\n</b>                                (pointing OFFSCREEN)\n                        It's there! Again!\n\n        The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right\n        BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.\n\n        The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers\n        SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman\n        points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE\n\n<b>        AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.\n</b>\n        An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,\n        lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle\n        appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,\n        flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.\n\n        Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to\n        the castle's upstairs window.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        That light...only burns after a\n                        murder's been committed.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                                (nods, turning toward\n                                the castle)\n                        Let's go.\n\n        The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'\n        in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the\n        TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually\n        sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING\n        himself to be strong.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're\n                        here for...eh, men?...ah...\n                                (points to men)\n                        Hennesey... Galbraith...\n                        Bottomley... You're comin' with us.\n\n        As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen\n        RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking\n        TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.\n        WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her\n        neck. She STARES at the departing men.\n\n<b>                                        ELDERLY WOMAN\n</b>                        May God help them.\n\n<b>                                                                        CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        THE CASTLE DOORS.\n</b>\n        Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,\n        serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the\n        police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.\n        The candle still FLICKERS.\n\n        A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened\n        through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy\n        and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using\n        all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door\n        latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle\n        stairs.\n\n        Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The\n        doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes\n        from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.\n\n        Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,\n        holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED\n        glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.\n\n<b>        INT. CASTLE\n</b>\n        Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a\n        STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre\n        sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick\n        COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are\n        VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.\n\n<b>                                        HENNESEY\n</b>                        It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could\n                        a human bein' survive?...\n\n        Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana\n        shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase\n        spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT\n        GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves\n        FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.\n\n        Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.\n        MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way\n        to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the\n        wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything\n        from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of\n        the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY\n        MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        This guy's got one hell of an ego.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say\n                        'e walks the moors every midnight...\n                        others claim e's been dead for\n                        years...\n\n        Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE\n        that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON\n        SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT\n        emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.\n        Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their\n        pistols. They FOLLOW.\n\n<b>        INT. ROOM\n</b>\n        A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient\n        FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with\n        dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the\n        windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room\n        in ORANGE LIGHT.\n\n        Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT\n        it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their\n        PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...\n\n        There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his\n        flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL\n        LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the\n        flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh\n        has SOBSIDED.\n\n        MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's\n        face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Hennesey?...

It sends\n        a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the\n        sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.\n\n<b>        INT. CASTLE\n</b>\n        Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.\n        MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far\n        wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the\n        ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the\n        others to FOLLOW.\n\n<b>        INT. BASEMENT\n</b>\n        A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy\n        holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind\n        him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN\n        with their every move.\n\n        MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight\n        causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!\n        FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING\n        HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.\n        MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Thanks for catchin' me.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        I'd rather be catchin' trout.\n\n        They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,\n        MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.\n        There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the\n        ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.\n\n        Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The\n        Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT\n        SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE\n        their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP\n        RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the\n        liquid. He TASTES.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Interesting blood type...\n\n        The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED.

And inside the room, is a deserted WINE\n        CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith\n<b>        CRIES OUT.\n</b>\n<b>                                        GALBRAITH\n</b>                                (pointing OFF SCREEN)\n                        Look!\n\n        Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.\n        Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A\n        FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.\n        He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.\n\n<b>        BEHIND THE DOOR\n</b>\n        A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt\n        walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless\n        DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly\n        familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!\n\n        CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP\n        of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It\n        rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.\n\n        A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an\n        order to his men.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Galbraith... You come with me! We'll\n                        search for Hennesey... Out here!\n                        Bottomley... You go with Doctor\n                        Jones...\n                                (finger shaking, points\n                                to inside of crypt)\n                        In there.\n\n        MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE\n        away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the\n        basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and\n        very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.\n\n<b>        INT. CRYPT\n</b>\n        Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed\n        CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.\n        Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He\n        PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the\n        crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their\n        every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...\n\n        Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far\n        end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The\n        sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.\n        Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL\n        that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by\n        his feet, is the DEAD BODY of\n\n        HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and\n        forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.\n\n        Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Let's get outta' here.\n\n        Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two\n        men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are\n        only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the\n        door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.\n\n<b>                                        BOTTOMLEY\n</b>                        Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open\n                        the door!\n\n        Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,\n        another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                                (motioning to candle)\n                        I need more light.\n\n        Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD\n        WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy\n        TURNS from the door.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Bottomley?...\n\n        NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is\n        GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Bottomley?...\n\n        AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It\n        PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a\n<b>        SHOCKING SIGHT!\n</b>\n        BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH\n        SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a\n        CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is\n        SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.\n        There is NO SIGN of anyone.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Who is it?... Who's there?...\n\n        The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED\n        Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door\n<b>        COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!\n</b>\n        Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back\n        his hand. His fingers are BURNT.\n\n<b>        INT. BASEMENT\n</b>\n        MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the\n        door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.\n        MacGowan CALLS through the door.\n\n<b>                                        MACGOWAN\n</b>                        Doctor Jones! Try to push!\n\n<b>        INT.

The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!\n\n        Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP\n        the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL\n<b>        HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!\n</b>\n        Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to\n        CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING\n<b>        HIS GRIP.\n</b>\n        Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of\n        the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy\n<b>        SWINGS DOWNWARD.\n</b>\n<b>        INT. ABYSS\n</b>\n        At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a\n        ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy\n        STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge\n<b>        SNAPS!\n</b>\n        Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A\n        MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!\n\n<b>        BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!\n</b>\n        A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat\n        FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up\n        beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out\n        of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and\n        disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        NOW they bite!\n\n        Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.\n        Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.\n\n        TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT\n        across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...\n        and Indy's HEAD!\n\n        Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above\n        the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS\n        HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO\n        STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.\n        He's going to DROWN!\n\n<b>        UNDERWATER\n</b>\n        In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.\n        But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses\n        COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he\n        SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana\n        hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.\n\n        A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of\n        the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain\n        is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.\n        CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the\n        fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING\n        OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR\n        returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.\n        He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.\n\n<b>        INDY'S POV\n</b>\n        He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully\n        DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK\n        of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan\n        crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.\n\n        At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY\n        MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness\n        appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating\n        his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before\n        him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the\n        family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.\n\n        Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.\n        Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.\n\n        Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT\n        of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.\n        Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?\n\n        Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He\n        speaks LOUDER.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Canyou hear me?...\n\n<b>        CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE\n</b>\n        Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.\n\n<b>        INDIANA\n</b>\n        still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy\n        is ANNOYED.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Listen, pal... There are two dead\n                        Policemen upstairs and...\n\n        The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.\n        TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG\n        Indy to the floor.\n\n        Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to\n        the scene before him.\n\n        Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and\n        skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a\n        display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES\n        to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still\n        BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.\n\n        Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP\n        at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves\n        the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the\n        air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.\n        For a MOMENT.\n\n        Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He\n<b>        RUNS.\n</b>\n        The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths\n<b>        FOAMING.\n</b>\n        Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.\n\n        Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope\n        that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the\n        wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.\n\n        The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain\n        OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The\n        dog is TRAPPED.\n\n        Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING\n        toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.\n        The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog\n        FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!\n\n<b>        EXT. WINDOW\n</b>\n        The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS\n        BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and\n        STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto\n        the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.\n\n<b>        INT. BANQUET ROOM\n</b>\n        Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana\n        walks toward the Baron.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Chow time's over, mister. You better\n                        start talkin'.\n\n        The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        There's a lot of strange things\n                        happening around here...\n\n        A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.\n        Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.\n\n        Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with\n        spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        ...and I want some answers! Do you\n                        hear me?\n                                (louder)\n                        I want some answers! Now!\n\n        There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO\n        FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only\n        INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through\n        the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see\n\n        A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN\n        FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black\n        knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP\n        BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward\n\n        ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made\n        of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT\n        OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its\n        powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO\n        GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!\n\n        The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS\n        back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone\n        crunching grip.\n\n        The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade\n        INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body\n        forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.\n        The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both\n        knights FALLING to the floor.\n\n        Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They\n        CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight\n        armed with a long, sharp SWORD!\n\n        Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his\n        plate.\n\n        Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to\n        FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He\n        DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS\n        the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the\n        room!\n\n        Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS\n        IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by\n        the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.\n\n        The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's\n        head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights\n        CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW\n        to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.\n        Indiana JUMPS to his feet.\n\n        The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE\n        KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.\n\n        Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He\n        spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.\n\n        The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the\n        rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!\n        The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!\n\n        The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the\n        whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The\n        knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's\n        sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight\n        ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.\n        Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the\n        knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.\n\n        Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!\n        SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white\n        knight COMES toward him.\n\n        Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to\n        face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES\n        to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The\n        sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.\n        Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE\n        perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF\n        to a freshly carved slice of pork.\n\n        Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of\n        armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.\n\n        The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy\n        GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He\n        continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the\n        chandelier.\n\n        At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the\n        table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that\n        holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The\n        chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The\n        knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from\n        its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.\n\n        Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,\n        Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.\n\n        The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS\n        INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery\n        throat. Indiana SNARLS.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Haven't you had enough?\n\n        Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.\n        His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME\n        MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier.

SUPPLY SHIPS,\n        SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with\n        various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and\n        RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,\n        low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.\n\n        An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit\n        from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is\n        UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS\n        AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.\n\n<b>        INDY'S POV - THE DOCK\n</b>\n        There is a a LOUD CAR HORN.

The car's\n        tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked\n        EXHAUST PIPE.

Scraggy is a rough,\n        unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY\n        of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears\n        TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY\n        body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.\n\n        Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy\n        SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy\n        stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before\n        him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS\n        into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with\n        a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...\n\n<b>                                        SCRAGGY\n</b>                        Indy!

We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.\n        Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.\n\n<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG\n</b>                                (German, English\n                                subtitles)\n                        Are we making contact?\n\n        The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING\n<b>        SMILE.\n</b>\n        Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to\n        SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the\n        cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT\n        KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of\n        him.

He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The\n        roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is\n        very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy\n        BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.\n\n        Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,\n        walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he\n        enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.\n\n<b>        INT. HOTEL\n</b>\n        Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky\n        African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid\n        hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door\n        with a key and ENTERS.\n\n<b>        INT. ROOM\n</b>\n        A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA,\n        TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the\n        fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks\n        to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There\n        is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It\n        SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE\n        leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.\n\n<b>        INT. OPENING\n</b>\n        Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A\n        SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various\n        COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS\n        are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An\n        enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE\n\n        TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both\n        speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an\n        UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked\n        on a STONE INCLINE, are\n\n        TWO AUTOMOBILES.

BRAND\n<b>        NEW.\n</b>\n        Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.\n        Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA\n        PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles\n        on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his\n        shoe.\n\n        Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi\n        wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING\n        SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers\n        Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg\n        also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused\n        by the movement of his arm.\n\n<b>        LIEUTENANT WERNER VON MEPEISTO\n</b>\n        stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is\n        THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him\n        the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO\n        eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.\n        He is over SIX FEET TALL.

With trembling fingers, he reaches over\n        and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission.

Betsy is still LAUGHING.\n\n<b>                                        BETSY\n</b>                        About time we had some fun!\n\n        A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.\n\n<b>                                        SCRAGGY\n</b>                        Bad spirits have Indy!

Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to\n        FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki\n        watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.\n\n        The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the\n        Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!\n\n<b>        UNDERWATER\n</b>\n        Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet\n        from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers\n        create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...\n        toward a SPINNING DEATH.\n\n        Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their\n        bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a\n        switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with\n        the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the\n        propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...\n\n        But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace\n        CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE\n<b>        PROPELLERS!\n</b>\n        Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD\n        surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to\n        safety.\n\n<b>        ABOVE WATER\n</b>\n        Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front\n        of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES\n\n        GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.\n        Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A\n        SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.\n\n<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG\n</b>                        Goodnight, Doctor Jones.\n\n        There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A\n        BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.\n        Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.\n\n        DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a\n        sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell\n        points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...\n\n        With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF\n        DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.\n\n<b>                                        DASHIELL\n</b>                        Scraggy said you might be needing\n                        some help, sport.\n\n        Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.\n\n        A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the\n        ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE\n        around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK\n        SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths\n        are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the\n        darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD\n        of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and\n        SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)\n\n        Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange\n        GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine\n        gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO\n        Nazi headquarters for help.\n\n        Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY\n        SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut\n        AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two\n        FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN\n        the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.\n\n        Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the\n        speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.\n\n<b>                                        DASHIELL\n</b>                        Indy! Rollout!\n\n        Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.\n        Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut\n        tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into\n        the pole! CRUSHED!\n\n        Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.\n\n<b>                                        DASHIELL\n</b>                        You okay, sport?\n\n        Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING.

The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID\n        WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.\n\n        The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the\n        warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.\n        The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat\n        BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.\n\n<b>        INT. WAREHOUSE\n</b>\n        Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS\n        across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell\n        gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.\n\n<b>        INDIANA'S POV\n</b>\n        The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.\n\n        Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS\n        his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE\n        REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The\n        whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.\n\n        Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat\n        driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.\n        His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS\n<b>        OPEN.\n</b>\n        Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red\n        faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP\n        KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to\n<b>        BREAK THE CONNECTION.\n</b>\n        Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by\n        Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.\n        Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE\n        NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at\n        Indiana.\n\n        Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.\n        Only a FEW THREADS remain.\n\n        Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.\n        JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.\n        Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE\n        PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!\n\n        Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has\n        met a GRISLY DEATH.\n\n        The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's\n        hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND\n        TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE\n        BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!\n        Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure\n        of the rushing water.\n\n<b>        CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE\n</b>        SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs\n        turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS\n        one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the\n        stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two\n        Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.\n\n        Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg\n        GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.\n<b>        AHEAD.\n</b>\n<b>        TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS\n</b>\n        are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING\n        between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships\n        move CLOSER.\n\n        Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE\n<b>        OPENING.\n</b>\n        In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi\n        PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A\n        RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around\n        Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.\n\n        Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening\n        between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and\n<b>        SMALLER...\n</b>\n        The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are\n        STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS\n        for air.\n\n        The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...\n        Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET\n<b>        AWAY.\n</b>\n        Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat\n        headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The\n        giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.\n\n        With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES\n        between the two Ocean Liners!\n\n        The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as\n        the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T\n        TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from\n        strangling Indiana. They TURN.\n\n        Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.\n\n        The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED\n        between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.\n        Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are\n        SPLATTERED through the night sky.\n\n        GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.\n        Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.\n\n        SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the\n        nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,\n        catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's\n        speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.\n\n        GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.\n        Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.\n        Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that\n        pierces the air.\n\n        Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill\n        with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy\n        on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head\n        on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.\n\n<b>                                        BETSY\n</b>                        What a romantic night!\n\n        An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to\n        the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts\n        her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the\n        departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.\n\n<b>                                        CLARE\n</b>                        Will they hurt Tyki?\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                                (shaking his head)\n                        They know he's important to us.\n                                (holds up ancient\n                                scroll)\n                        They'll use him to bargain for this.\n\n        Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.\n\n<b>                                        BETSY\n</b>                        Indy, you smell so good!

The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick\n        JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering\n        INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS\n        of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm\n        trees.\n\n        A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the \"ADOBO\", travels along the\n        Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of\n        SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of\n        Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.\n        They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT\n        behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew\n        members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,\n        singing a FOLK SONG.\n\n        INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with\n        sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters.

SEVERAL\n        DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their\n        bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP\n        the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.\n\n        Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is\n        SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal.

Before the\n        driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.\n\n        Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered\n        with SHOCK. FEAR.\n\n<b>        INT.

Betsy\n        TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand\n        GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY\n        PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE\n        on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the\n        pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears\n        GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES\n\n        AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He\n        is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His\n        bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.\n        FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled\n        with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.\n        THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of\n        the kitchen.\n\n<b>        INDIANA\n</b>\n        has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his\n        innocence. She continues to WRITE.

Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy\n        CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his\n        feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to\n        SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.\n\n        Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her\n        face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-\n        like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in\n        SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and\n        ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his\n        head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with\n        crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the\n        waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.\n\n        The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK\n        Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the\n        crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.\n\n        Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a\n        swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.\n        ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy.

He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.\n\n        Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging\n        Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He\n<b>        TURNS.\n</b>\n<b>        A PIRATE SHIP\n</b>\n        has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.\n        COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship.

Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,\n        to the Pirate Ship.\n\n        INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an\n        effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river\n        boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in\n        hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.\n\n        Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water\n        surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS\n        and FLYING ARROWS.\n\n<b>        EXT.

The\n        Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a\n        SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword\n        SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the\n        deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy\n        gives her a THANKFUL NOD.\n\n<b>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP\n</b>\n        Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the\n        Pirate Ship.

The fuse is LIT.\n<b>        BURNING.\n</b>\n        Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S\n        OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of\n        the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...\n\n<b>        EXT.

At the last moment, Indiana\n        OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS\n        FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!\n        Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden\n        staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.\n\n<b>        EXT.

Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to\n        AVOID being thrown into the waters below.\n\n<b>        EXT. RIVER BOAT\n</b>\n        The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS.

But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.\n        Keeping the boat AFLOAT.\n\n        The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries\n        to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from\n        falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM\n<b>        OF A DEAD PIRATE.\n</b>\n<b>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP\n</b>\n        are IMMERSED into the waterfall.

An enormous, underground CAVERN.\n        Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the\n        cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.\n        Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout\n        the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for\n        the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.\n\n        The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall\n        THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a\n        ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a\n        SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and\n        swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They\n        take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.\n\n        KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.\n        Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS\n        OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off\n        of the ship. His sword at her THROAT.

A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.\n        ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for\n        the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the\n        vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY\n        makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE!

JUST MISSING HIM!\n\n        As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag\n        of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the\n        scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or\n        retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY\n        Pirate wants his money.

INTO THE PIT.\n        SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.\n        CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK.

Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust\n        CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy\n        LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino\n        CHASES him!\n\n        Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S\n<b>        FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS.\n</b>\n<b>        INT.

Indy begins to RUN\n        IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to\n        TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running\n        ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the\n        rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,\n        Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!\n\n        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank\n        is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES\n        ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST\n        MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The\n        tank FOLLOWS.\n\n        Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL\n        over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,\n        the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT\n        RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.\n        HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.\n\n        Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see\n        the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.\n        They run toward a RAVINE.\n\n        The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at\n<b>        FULL SPEED.\n</b>\n<b>        INT.

Moments before he is crushed\n        beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.\n\n        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot\n        of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.\n        Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged\n        rocks.

It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin\n        fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS\n        Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio.

Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS\n        remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's\n        FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES\n        to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to\n        the machine guns.\n\n        In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.\n        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE\n        Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the\n        treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's\n        hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.\n        Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from\n        the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds\n        of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.\n\n        Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A\n        CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree\n        begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone\n        PANICS.

Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his\n        head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine\n        guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.\n\n        Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over\n        the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the\n        enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the\n        other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of\n        the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is\n<b>        DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.\n</b>\n        Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the\n        tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly\n        FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE\n        off the metal beside him.\n\n        Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.\n        Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.\n        It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.\n        Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.\n\n        Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level\n        of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.\n        Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.\n        He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's\n        side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the\n        Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm\n        INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.\n\n        The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It\n        is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.\n\n<b>        INT. TANK\n</b>\n        Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.\n\n<b>        EXT.

The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg\n        ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane\n        SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying\n        FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW\n<b>        FEET.\n</b>\n        Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and\n        ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.\n        STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.\n\n        Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the\n        tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER\n        SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for\n        Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This\n        time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy\n<b>        CRIES OUT.\n</b>\n        The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting\n<b>        CLOSER...CLOSER...\n</b>\n        His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm\n        from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and\n        HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the\n        biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's\n        Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls\n        the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE\n        the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.\n        The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK\n        SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from\n        the tank.\n\n        Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the\n        Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy\n        TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the\n        treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.\n\n<b>        INT.

FALLING OVER THE\n        RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!\n\n        There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the\n        trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all\n        of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from\n        FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends.

The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree\n        CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.\n\n        On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is\n        UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO\n        CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto\n        the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.\n\n        Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill\n        his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE.

The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an\n        upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant\n        mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.\n        Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.\n\n        The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one\n        SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!\n\n        Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.\n        But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR!

Indy STOPS. His\n        mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others\n        STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND\n<b>        TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!\n</b>\n<b>        THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG\n</b>\n        LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every\n        building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A\n        HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of\n        several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL\n        surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.\n        PASSAGEWAY into the city.\n\n        A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy\n        similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,\n        approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The\n        guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues\n        to REPEAT a certain phrase.\n\n        Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.\n\n<b>                                        SCRAGGY\n</b>                        He say... \"Our Prince has returned\n                        home\".\n\n        Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS\n        is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the\n        Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous\n        drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes\n        from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of\n        light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and\n        the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED\n        INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing\n        light.\n\n<b>        INT. CITY\n</b>\n        WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the\n        bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various\n        other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES\n        surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED\n        WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.\n        ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They\n        RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING\n        him home.\n\n        Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS\n        with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his\n        bindings.\n\n        Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a\n        VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the\n        can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A\n        LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate\n        king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.\n        The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.\n\n        Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They\n        ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace\n        doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's\n        RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms\n        over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.\n\n        Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.\n        Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the\n        others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the\n        others.\n\n<b>                                        SCRAGGY\n</b>                        He thank us...for returning his son.\n\n        Indiana and the others SMILE.

The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his\n        bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES\n        ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his\n        mechanical arm.\n\n        Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                                (anxious, to Scraggy)\n                        Ask him where we may find the burial\n                        place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-\n                        Kung...\n\n        Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by\n        Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED\n        AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly\n        AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES\n        Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!\n        Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling\n        Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is\n        FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.\n\n        The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to\n<b>        VIOLENCE.\n</b>\n        Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        Bastard...\n\n        Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by\n        the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is\n        suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to\n        Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who\n        translates for Indy.\n\n<b>                                        SCRAGGY\n</b>                        It is written...

He RAISES his\n        MECHANICAL ARM. In a \"Heil Hitler\" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the\n        Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.\n\n        Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows\n        that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL!

He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait\n        for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.\n<b>        DROOLING.

The\n        electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with\n        electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the\n        powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows\n        from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's\n        charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.\n\n        Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now\n        INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his\n        whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining\n        fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy\n        SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.\n\n        MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL\n        FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy.

The glass surrounding the\n        tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.\n        Beginning to MOVE.

The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED\n        ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the\n        skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The\n        ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down\n        upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's\n        bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.\n        The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the\n        Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing\n<b>        SMALLER. THINNER.\n</b>\n        The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL\n<b>        TRANSFORMATION.\n</b>\n        As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken\n        to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the\n        skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken\n        Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the\n        countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...\n\n        SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have\n        ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.\n        His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is\n        DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An\n        extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a\n        STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.\n\n        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their\n        knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.\n\n        Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.\n        He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS\n        expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.\n        His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.\n\n<b>                                        SUN WU KUNG\n</b>                        We cannot bury these men!...

We hear him in\n                        English...the pygmies hear him in\n                        their language.\n\n        Betsy NODS.

I demand\n                        it!... Return their souls!\n\n        A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A\n        small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.\n        The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS\n        to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.\n        He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically\n        FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The\n        peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung\n        SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.\n\n        CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH\n        GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an\n        individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,\n        there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The\n        bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the\n        bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY\n        does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies\n        CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has\n        been RESTORED.\n\n        Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of\n        Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM\n        GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP\n        OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is\n        PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP\n        Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.\n        But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.\n\n<b>                                        INDIANA\n</b>                        What the hell's goin' on?\n\n        Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.\n        Clare SMILES at Indy.\n\n<b>                                        CLARE\n</b>                        I think there is someone you should\n                        meet...\n\n        Clare POINTS to behind Indy, who TURNS and sees the smiling SUN WU\n        KUNG.

But Clare MOVES\n        AWAY. BONZO THE GORILLA enters the FRAME. BONZO KISSES Indy on the\n        lips. Indy OPENS his eyes. He tries to MOVE AWAY. But the Gorilla will\n        not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to\n        the ground.\n\n        By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade\n        BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy\n        and Scraggy are LAUGHING. Betsy EXPLAINS to Clare.\n\n<b>                                        BETSY\n</b>                        Sorry. Guess I left her cage open...\n                        she followed us.\n\n        The ocean liner's horn SOUNDS! It begins to DRIFT away from the dock.\n        Indiana TURNS and RUNS up the stairs, leading to the boat. The boat is\n        a FEW FEET from the dock. Indy LEAPS onto the boat. He MAKES IT. JUST\n<b>        IN TIME.\n</b>\n        Indiana pauses... Suddenly UPSET. He realizes that he's FORGOTTEN the\n        Golden Hooped Rod! It SITS on the dock. At Scraggy's FEET. As the\n        Ocean Liner PULLS AWAY, Indy is about to SCREAM to his friends... But\n        Clare PICKS UP the crate. She SHRUGS to Indy. The ocean liner pulls\n        FURTHER...FURTHER...from the dock. Indiana is HELPLESS. He CAN'T GO\n<b>        BACK.\n</b>\n<b>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>        INT. CLARE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING\n</b>\n        Clare is SOUND ASLEEP in bed. CAMERA PANS TO a corner of the room. The\n        wooden crate holding the Golden Hooped Rod RESTS here. Suddenly, the\n        box's NAILS begin to TWIST. TURN. As if they were being turned by\n        INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE\n        by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the\n        moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It\n        CHANGES SHAPE...turning into a GOLDEN EAGLE! The bird slowly FLAPS its\n        wings and FLIES OUT of the open window. INTO the night. Clare\n        continues to peacefully SLEEP.\n\n<b>                                                                        CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT\n</b>\n        The full moon ILLUMINATES the night sky. SHIMMERING across the ocean\n        waters. Countless BRIGHT STARS sparkle in the night sky. Indy's OCEAN\n        LINER sails across the water. The image of an EAGLE appears in the\n        night sky. SILHOUETTED against the moon.\n\n<b>        INT. SHIP CABIN\n</b>\n        Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed. The room's porthole\n        mysteriously SWINGS OPEN. The Golden Eagle FLIES inside. The eagle\n        TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod. The rod LEANS AGAINST the\n        wall. The moonlight REFLECTS the rod, SHINING into Indiana's eyes.\n        Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is\n        SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The\n        CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.\n\n<b>                                        SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)\n</b>                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a\n                        faithful friend. It is capable of\n                        one hundred transformations...and\n                        will always remain by your side.\n\n        Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...\n        SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.\n        SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of\n        the ship SAILING across the ocean.\n\n<b>                                        THE END\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Indiana Jones IV</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Christopher Columbus\" title=\"Scripts by Christopher Columbus\">Christopher Columbus</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Indiana Jones IV Script.html#comments\" title=\"Indiana Jones IV comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:03.590255"}
