From this distance they appear to be a\n\tcompany of Army Cavalry Soldiers.\n\n\tCLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS\n\n\treveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted\n\tagainst the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.\n\n\tThe OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.\n\n\t\t\tOFFICER\n\t\tDis-mount!\n\n\tRIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that\n\tthis is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The\n\t\"Commanding Officer\" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.\n\n\tOne of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,\n\tbends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.\n\n               \t\t\tFIRST SCOUT\n\t\tHerman's horsesick!\n\n\tA BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored\n\thair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite\n\tfor knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his\n\tuniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.\n\n               \t\t\tSCOUTMASTER\n\t\tChaps, don't anybody wander off.\n\t\tSome of the passageways in here\n\t\tcan run for miles.\n\n\tTwo Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.\n\n\n\tINT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n\tThe two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops\n\tseveral degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.\n\n\tHERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's\n\tdrawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n               \t\t\tHERMAN\n\t\tI don't think this is such a good\n\t\tidea.\n\n\tLAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.\n\n\tThe VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light\n\tof kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach\n\tcautiously, careful to stay hidden.\n\n\t\t\tHERMAN\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\tThis is what they see:\n\n\n\tFOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the\n\tpueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called \"Kivas.\"\n\n\tThe men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery\n\tBoy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his\n\tshoulders).\n\n\tAnd the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT\n\tFEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet\n\tanything that this is INDLANA JONES.\n\n\tHowever, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,\n\twe are shocked to discover that it is someone else.\n\n\tWe'll call him FEDORA.\n\nTITLES END.\n\n\tThe TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.\n\n\tNow we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.\n\n                  \t\t               FEDORA\n\t                 \tAlfred, did you get anything yet?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMAN\n           \t     \tNothing.

I got something\n\t\tright here.\n\n\tMore whoops from the other men.\n\n\tFEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes\n\tROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the\n\tbox as Fedora opens it.\n\n\t\t\tROSCOE\n        \t\t      (more whoops; then)\n\t\tOh, look at thatl\n        \t\t      (more whoops)\n\t\tWe're richl We're rich!\n\n               \t\t\tHALFBREED\n\t\tShut up. Shut up.\n\n\tFEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's\n\tcomrades practically salivate at the sight of it.\n\n               \t\t\tROSCOE (O.S.)\n\t\tWell, we're rich, ain't we?l\n\n\tINDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.\n\n               \t\t\tHERMAN\n\t\tIndy? Indy? What are they doing?\n\t\tIndiana? Indiana?\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tShhhl\n\n\tFEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its\n\tbeauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to\n\tthem.\n\n               \t\t\tHALFBREED\n\t\tHey, we got to find more stuff\n\t\tto bring back.\n\n\tINDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n        \t\t      (hushed; urgent)\n\t\tIt's the Cross of Coronadol\n\t\tCortes gave it to him in 15201\n\n\nCONTINUED: (3)\n\n\tFEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box\n\tand the lantern.\n\n\tINDY turns back to observe the men.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tThat Cross is an important artifact.\n\t\tIt belongs in a museum.\n\n\tA look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward\n\tHERMAN.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tRun back and find the others.\n\t\tTell Mister Havelock that there\n\t\tare men looting in the caves.\n\n\tHERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror\n\tas a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tHave him bring the sheriff.\n\n\tINDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tIt's only a snake.\n\n\tINDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tDid you hear what I said?\n\n               \t\t\tHERMAN\n\t\tRight.

I'll think of\n\t\tsomething.\n\n\tINDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees\n\tthe Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for\n\tadditional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of\n\tthe Cross...\n\n\tFEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.\n\n               \t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\tDig with your hands.\n\n\tINDY picks up the Cross.\n\n\nCONTINUED: (4)\n\n               \t\t\tFEDORA (O . S . )\n\t\tNot with your mouth.\n\n\tAs FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his\n\tpants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's\n\tfeet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.\n\n               \t\t\tROSCOE\n\t\tHe's got our thing!\n\n\t\t\t HALFBREED\n\t\tGet 'im!\n\n                                  \n\n\tThe three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock\n\teach other over in the attempt.\n\n\tOnly FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in\n\tthe direction of his fleeing companions\u0097then sets off\n\tafter INDY.\n\n\n         \n\tEXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY\n\n\tINDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.\n\n\tHe pauses\u0097squints\u0097shields his eyes\u0097looks in all directions.\n\n               \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tMister Havelock! Anybody\n\t\tEverybody's lost but me!\n\n\tHe hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,\n\tHALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\t  There he isl                   \n\n       \t\t\tMEN\n\t\t      (AD-LIBS)\n\t\tLet's go! Let's get him! Let's\n\t\tgo!\n\n\tIndy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy\n\tputs two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy\n\tputs the Cross in his belt.\n\n\tINDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But\n\tthe horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a\n\tstanding position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his\n\tback teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.\n\n\tFEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into\n\tthe saddle and gallop off.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n \t\t\tINDY\n\t\tHyahl Hyah!\n\n                     \n\n                                    \t\tROSCOE\n\t\tHey! Come back here!\n\n\tFEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK\n\tAND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two\n\tmore gang members). Now we glimpse...\n\n\n\tTHE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT\n\n\tThe passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm\n\tis out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from\n\tthe sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in\n\tthe truck.\n\n                                  \t\tPANAMA HAT\n\t\tCome on. Get him!\n\n\tINDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace\n\twith his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.\n\n\tSpeeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched\n\tlow and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin\n\tpumping.\n\n\tINDY VEERS OFF in a new direction\u0097toward a RAILROAD TRACK.\n\n\n\tEXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY\n\n\tThe train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over\n\this shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he\n\tLEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.\n\n\tHe clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from\n\tthe truck onto the train.\n\n\tHALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed\n\truns after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked\n\ton a flatcar.\n\n\tINDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still\n\trunning after him, Indy enters the trap door of...\n\n\n\tINT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY\n\n\tand finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.\n\tSeveral feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:\n\tAlligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\tThen, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door\u0097followed by ROUGH RIDER.\n\tHalfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.\n\n\tINDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at\n\tIndy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.\n\n\tThe combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended\n\tfor, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.\n\n\tEveryone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL\n\tBOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's\n\tend of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.\n\n\tHe lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-\n\tto-eye with an\u0097\n\n\tENORMOUS ANACONDA\n\n\tThe head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tOh...\t\t\n\n\tINDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tOh... Oh...\n\n\tHundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.\n\tEngulf him. Almost smother him.\n\n\tINDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.\n\n\tINDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.\n\n\tHALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.\n\tROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.\n\n\t\t\tROUGH RIDER\n\t\tHere, let me.\n\n\n\n\tEXT. THE TRAIN- DAY\n\n\tINDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks\n\tworried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and\n\ttosses it away.\n\n\tROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at\n\thim. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...\n\n\tEXT. A FLATCAR - DAY\n\n\tINDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a\n\tlong stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto\n\tthe roof of the rhino boxcar.\n\n\n\tINT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY\n\n\tas a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE\n\tBLACK RHINOCEROS.\n\n\n\tEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY\n\n\tROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,\n\trolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.\n\tThings get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.\n\n\n\tIN THE BOXCAR BELOW\n\n\t... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the\n\tcommotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS\n\tHORN THROUGH THE ROOF.\n\n\tBACK TO THE ROOFTOP\n\n\tas the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and\n\tRoscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.\n\tSMASH! The horn comes up again\u0097RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.\n\n \t\t\tINDY\n                   \t\tHoly smokes!\n                                    \n\n\tINDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from\n\tfalling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.\n\n\n\tEXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY\n\n\tThe WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The\n\tdoor is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.\n\n\n\tEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY\n\n\tINDY gets to his feet\u0097looks ahead\u0097sees a WATER TANK alongside the track\n\tdirectly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...\n\n\tIn an instant, he calculates his approach\u0097times the distance\u0097and LEAPS for\n\tthe tank's WATER SPOUT.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\tHe catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A\n\tFULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout\n\tdeposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks\n\tup to see FEDORA walking toward him.\n\n               \t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\tCome on, kid. There's no way\n\t\tout of this.\n\n\tAs INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF\n\tCOLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.\n\n\n\tINT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY\n\n\tINDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n                  \t\tOhhh!                                   \n\n\tINDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in\n\tthrough the cracks between the boards.\n\n\tThen INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an\n\tAFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust\n\tswirls up into the shafts of sunlight.\n\n\tAnd INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged\n\tfrom his belt during the fall...\n\n\tINDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He\n\tcarefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.\n\n\tINDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP\n\tflying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.\n\n\tThe Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and\n\ttries again. This time\u0097success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion\n\tBELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.\n\n\tINDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs\n\taway even more. Indy inches forward\u0097bends down (never taking his eyes off\n\tthe Lion)\u0097picks up the Cross\u0097and steps back again, sweat pouring down his\n\tface.\n\n\tBut now... how to get out?\n\n\tHe looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING\n\tDOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.\n\n               \t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\tToss up the whip.\n\n\tEXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR\n\n\tFEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, \"reels\" INDY out of the\n\tStockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.\n\n\tThe men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to\n\tface them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORA\n         \t \tYou've got heart, kid.\n\t\t       (indicates Cross)\n\t\tBut that belongs to me.\n\n       \t\t\tINDY\n\t\t       (takes Cross from his belt)\n\t\tIt belongs to Coronado.\n\n       \t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\t       (overlapping)\n          \t\tCoronado is dead.

A tug-of-war\n\tensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS\n\tAROUND Roscoe's hand.\n\n\tROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER\u0097releases his grip on the Cross and tries\n\tto shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO\n\tTHE NEXT CAR.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORA\n          \t\tDon't let him get awayl\n\n\tINDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading\n\t\"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE.\"\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tMagic?\n\n\tHe glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping\n\tinside.\n\n\tFEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORA\n          \t\tHold it. Make sure he doesn't\n\t\tdouble back.\n\n\tINT. THE CABOOSE - DAY\n\n\twhich contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of\n\tthe caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC\n\tBOX.\n\n               \t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\tOkay, kid. out of the box.\n\t\tNow.\n\n\tFEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly\n\tcollapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely\n\tvanished.\n\n\tFEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.\n\tHe turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the\n\tbalcony and sees:\n\n\tINDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.\n\n\n\t\t\tFEDORA\n\t\tDamn.\n\n\n\tEXT.

The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps\n\tclearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.\n\n\tPROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very\n\tancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a\n\tbeautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window.

He grabs a\n\thold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly\n\tavoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still\n\tholding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly\n\tonto a crate of TNT.

THE MOTORBOAT - DAY\n\n\tINDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a\n\tTurkish Agent JUMPS in with him.\n\n\tELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade\n\tpunches.\n\n\tEXT.

As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in\n\tthe Agent's hand. It FIRES.\n\n\tAs INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him\n\tand two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.\n\n\tINDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\t      (to ELSA)\n\t\tAre you crazy?!

Are you crazy?!\n\n\tINDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.\n\tTurning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN\n\tthe two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tI said go around!\n\n\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tYou said go between them!\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tI said don't go between them!\n\n\tIt's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom\n\tup on either side of them like cavern walls.\n\n\n\tEXT.

But the Enemy\n\tSpeedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO\n\tTHE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.\n\n\tINDY AND ELSA\n\n\tspin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear\n\tracing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at\n\tINDY and ELSA.\n\n\n\tKAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT\n\t\n\tmatches Indy's move for move.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE HARBOR\n\n\tThe two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING\n\tMACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until\n\tfinally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.\n\n\tThe machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control\n\tof the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.\n\n\tAs Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of\n\tANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY\n\tsteps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then\n\tturns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins\n\thelplessly in the churning water.\n\n\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tNo!!\n\n\tINDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back\n\tinto the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the\n\tSteamer's giant propeller blades.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tWhy are you trying to kill us?\n\n\t\t               KAZIM\n\t\tBecause you're looking for the\n\t\tHoly Grail.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tMy father was looking for the\n\t\tHoly Grail.

It's yours!\n\n\tThe wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and\n\tjumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of\n\ttime.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tAll right!

And\n\t\tfor all that time the Brotherhood\n\t\tof the Cruciform Sword has been\n\t\tprepared to do anything to keep\n\t\tit safe.\n\n\tKAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it\n\tis, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of\n\ta broadsword.\n\n\t\t               KAZIM\n\t\tLet me get off at this jetty.\n\n\tThe boat is close to the edge of the canal.

VOGEL enters.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tIntolerable.\n\n\n\t\t               VOGEL\n\t\tDoctor Schneider. Message from\n\t\tBerlin.

It will show\n\t\tthem our progress, ahead of\n\t\tschedule. Without a map, I'm\n\t\tafraid it's no better than a\n\t\tsouvenir.\n\n\tHe hands her the Grail Diary.\n\n\t\t\tVOGEL\n\t\t         (to DONOVAN, meaning\n\t\t          Indy and Henry)\n\t\tLet me kill them now.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\t\t               ELSA\n\t\tNo. If we fail to recover the\n\t\tpages from Brody, we'll need them\n\t\talive.\n\n\t\t\tDONOVAN\n\t\t    (to VOGEL, with a\n\t\t     helpless shrug)\n\t\tAlways do what the doctor orders.\n\n\tDONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,\n\tELSA turns to INDY.\n\n\t\t               ELSA\n\t\tDon't look at me like that\u0097we\n\t\tboth wanted the Grail, I would\n\t\thave done anything to get it.\n\t\tYou would have done the same.\n\n\tINDY shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tI'm sorry you think so.\n\n\tShe runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.\n\n\tINDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak\n\tquietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.\n\n\t\t\tELSA\n\t\t      (whispers)\n\t\tI can't forget... how wonderful\n\t\tit was.\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tThank you. It was rather wonderful.\n\n\tShe smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather\n\tdisappointed.\n\n\tVOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.\n\n\t\t               VOGEL\n\t\tDoctor Schneider! Your car is\n\t\twaiting.\n\n\t\t\tELSA\n\t\t     (to INDY, after\n\t\t      finishing the kiss)\n\t\tThat's how Austrians say goodbye.\n\n\tELSA exits.

A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head\n\taround.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tOhh. . .\n\n\tVOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\t      (to himself)\n\t\tOoooh...

INDY squirms his\n\tbody around towards Henry's hand.\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tWhat am I looking for?\n\t\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tMy lucky charm.\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tFeels like a cigarette lighter.\n\n\nCONTINUED: (3)\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tTry and burn through the ropes.\n\n\tHENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tVery good.\n\n\tHENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the\n\tfloor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to\n\tburn. INDY doesn't know it yet.\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tI ought to tell you something.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tDon't get sentimental now Dad\u0097\n\t\tsave it 'til we get out of here.\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tThe floor's on fire!

Rock\n\t\tyour Chair.  Do what I do.\n\n\tThey begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.\n\n\n\tEXT. CASTLE - DAY\n\n\tas ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI\n\tSOLDIERS .\n\n\tAnother car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into\n\tthe rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.\n\n\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\tEtwas wichtig, mein Herr.\n\n\tDONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.\n\n\t\t               DONOVAN\n\t\tWell, we have Marcus Brody.

CASTLE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tINDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to\n\tcommunicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in\n\topposite directions.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tDad!\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tDad!\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tDad!\n\n\tFinally they turn their heads in the same direction.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tHead for the fireplace!\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tOh.\n\n\n\tBANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE\n\tFIREPLACE\u0097the only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tI think I can get these ropes\n\t\toff.\n\n\tIndy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal\n\tgrill that operates a Secret Door.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tWhoopsl\n\n\tThe fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find\n\tthemselves in the:\n\n\n\tINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY\n\n\twhere a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,\n\tswitches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.\n\tTheir backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.\n\n\tThe floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:\n\n\n\tINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tinside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tOur situation has not improved.\n\n\tINDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tListen Dad...

RADIO ROOM - DAY\n\n\tFOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and\n\tcoordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She\n\tscreams.\n\n\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tAlarm!\n\n\tNow the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.\n\n\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tSchnel!!\n\n\tTWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY\n\n\tINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN\n\n\tINDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO.

And he immediately begins to untie his father.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tWell done, boy!\n\n\tINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY\n\n\tAll FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and\n\tbegin to rotate through the Secret Door.\n\n\n\tINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other side\u0097but there is NO SIGN\n\tOF INDY AND HENRY.\n\n\tThe RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one\n\thand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY\n\tescaped through these flames?\n\n\tNot a chance.\n\n\tThey've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,\n\tBEHIND the RADIOMEN.\n\n\tOne of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against\n\tthe rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY\n\tbehind.\n\n\tHENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the\n\tnext room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS\n\trush forward to him.\n\n\tINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY\n\n\tINDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,\n\tsealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.\n\n\n\tINT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY\n\n\tVogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO\n\tMORE NAZIS fall into step with him.\n\n\tINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY\n\n\tINDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands\n\tthe case to HENRY and they begin to run.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tCome on Dad.\n\n\tINT. SECRET ROOM - DAY\n\n\tINDY and HENRY step into an empty room.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tDead end.\n\n\tHENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches\n\tfrantically for an exit.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tThere's got to be a... a secret\n\t\tdoor around.

The floor at\n\tINDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI\n\n\tINDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through\n\tthe opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tDad! \n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t                   ... the solution presents itself.\n\n\tHENRY follows INDY down the staircase.\n\n\n\tINT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY\n\n\tThe stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN\n\tbeneath the mountain on which the castle was built.\n\n\tA full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see\n\tMOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.\n\n\t\t                  INDY\n\t\tGreat.

It's been better than\n\t\tmost.\n\n\tINDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tCome on, Dad. Come onl\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tWhat about the boat? We're not\n\t\tgoing on the boat?\n\n\n\tINT. SECRET ROOM - DAY\n\n\tVOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase\n\tleading below. They quickly descend the stairs.\n\n\n\tINT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY\n\n\tas VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat\n\tis missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.\n\n\t\t               VOGEL\n\t\tSie alle ins Boat. Schnell!\n\n\tCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART\n\tas INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE\n\tDOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.\n\n\tVOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.\n\n\tSTRAIGHT CUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY\n\n\tINDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY\n\tappears worried.\n\n\t                                     INDY\n\t\tHa!\n\n\tFOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES\n\n\tThey chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.\n\n\tINDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps\n\tas he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along\n\ta higher road running in the same direction.\n\n\n\tEXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY\n\n\tINDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS\n\tapproaches from a higher road.\n\n\tA GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and\n\tHENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.\n\n\t\t               GUARD\n\t\tHalt!

Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the\n\tway to BERLIN or VENEDIG.\n\n\tIndy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tStop!\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tStop!

CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT\n\n\tA Nazi Rally\u0097a book-burning is in process.\n\n\tThe mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College\n\tStudents and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.\n\n\tFlags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically\n\tfrom side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous\n\tcrowd.\n\n\tINDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi\n\tSoldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic\u0097which happens to be several sizes\n\ttoo big.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tMy boy, we are Pilgrims in an\n\t\tunholy land.\n\n\tThen... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG\n\tHIS LINE OF SIGHT to:\n\n\tTHE PODIUM\n\n\twhere high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as\n\tthey oversee the rally.\n\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi\n\tOfficers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she\n\tknows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.\n\n\t                                      INDY\n\t\tFraulein Doctor. Where is it?\n\n\tStill startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her\n\tthoughts.\n\n\t                                      ELSA\n\t\tHow did you get here?\n\n\t                                      INDY\n\t\tWhere is it? I want it.\n\n\tINDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the\n\tDiary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\t\t               ELSA\n\t\tYou came back for the book?\n\t\tWhv?\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tMy father didn't want it\n\t\tincinerated.\n\n\tShe understands him.

He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And\n\tthe same goes for screaming.\n\n\tINDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He\n\tmoves over to HENRY.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tI've got it. Let's get the hell\n\t\tout of here.\n\n\tThey move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage\n\tcoming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's\n\tsignature.\n\n\tHITLER pauses to sign them.

Ready to go down in\n\t\thistory?\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tAs what? A Nazi stooge like you?\n\n\t\t\tDONOVAN\n\t\t       (scornfully)\n\t\tNazis?!\u0097Is that the limit of\n\t\tyour vision?! The Nazis want to\n\t\twrite themselves into the Grail\n\t\tlegend and take on the world.\n\t\tWell, they're welcome. But I want\n\t\tthe Grail itself. The cup that\n\t\tgives everlasting life.\n\t\tHitler can have the world, but\n\t\the can't take it with him. I'm\n\t\tgoing to be drinking my own health\n\t\twhen he's gone the way of the\n\t\tDodo.\n\t\t      (he draws his\n\t\t       pistol)\n\t\tThe Grail is mine, and you're\n\t\tgoing to get it for me.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tShooting me won't get you anywhere.\n\n\t\t               DONOVAN\n\t\tYou know something, Doctor Jones?...\n\t\tyou're absolutely right.\n\n\tThen DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY.

Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to\n\this assistance.\n\n\n\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n\n\tINDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.\n\n\tDONOVAN points the gun at him:\n\n\t\t\tDONOVAN\n\t\tYou can't save him when you're\n\t\tdead.\n\n\tINDY hesitates.\n\n\t\t               DONOVAN\n\t\tThe healing power of the Grail is\n\t\tthe only thing that can save your\n\t\tfather now. It's time to ask yourself\n\t\twhat you believe.\n\n\tINDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of\n\thim. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions.

Because INDY is in the act of\n\tkneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.\n\n\tInstinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.\n\tFrom his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR\n\tSHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.\n\n\tINDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a\n\tSMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden\n\twheels turn\u0097the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope\n\taround the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\tI'm through!\n\n\n\tELSA AND DONOVAN\n\n\t\t\tDONOVAN\n\t\tWe're through!\n\n\tBRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.\n\n\t\t\tSALLAH\n\t\t      (to HENRY)\n\t\tHe's all right.\n\n\tHENRY shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tBACK TO INDY\n\n\tholding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.\n\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\t\"The second challenge is the\n\t\t Word of God.

Indy, you must hurry!!\n\t\tCome quickly!\n\n\tBACK TO INDY\n\n\t\t\tINDY\n\t\t     (realizing)\n\t\tIt's... a leap of faith. Oh,\n\t\tGod.\n\n\tHENRY\n\n\tcalls to his son.\n\n\n\t\t               HENRY\n\t\tYou must believe, boy. you must...\n\t\tbelieve.\n\n\tWe see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We\n\tsee that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is\n\tgoing to fall 100 feet to his death. And then\u0097he doesn't! He appears to be held\n\tup by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.\n\n\tINDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.\n\n\tIngeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks\n\t100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with\n\tlines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet\n\tare stepping.\n\n\tIt's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in\n\tperfect alignment with everything we see below.\n\n\tWhen INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect\n\talignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and\n\the crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.\n\n\tIndy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.\n\n\tA vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a\n\thundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all\n\tglitter and shine.\n\n\tINDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that\n\ta man is praying at the altarl\n\n\tHe has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL\n\tKNIGHT.\n\n\n\tCLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT\n\n\tBut we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.\n\tPerhaps we see his eyes.\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\tWhen the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,\n\tprepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at\n\tIndy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too\n\tmuch. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt\n\tto fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy\n\tapproaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient\n\tman.\n\n\t\t               KNIGHT\n\t\tI knew you'd come, but my strength\n\t\thas left me.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tWho are you?\n\n\t\t               KNIGHT\n\t\tThe last of three brothers who\n\t\tswore an oath to find the Grail\n\t\tand to guard it.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tThat was seven hundred years ago.\n\n\t\t               KNIGHT\n\t\tA long time to wait.\n\n\tThe GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.\n\n\t\t               KNIGHT\n\t\tYou're strangely dressed...for a\n\t\tknight.\n\n\t\t               INDY\n\t\tI'm not exactly...a knight.

He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.\n\n\tELSA chooses a cup\u0097a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.\n\n\tDONOVAN instantly takes it from her.\n\n\t\t               DONOVAN\n\t\tOh, yes. It's more beautiful than\n\t\tI'd ever imagined. This certainly\n\t\tis the cup of the King of Kings.\n\n\tDONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.\n\n\t\t\tDONOVAN\n\t\tEternal life!\n\n\tDONOVAN drinks from the goblet.\n\n\tThen, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He\n\tgrabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.\n\n\t\t               DONOVAN\n\t\tWhat . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .\n\t\tme. . .?\n\n\tHe starts to age\u0097fast!

As he falls he BODY BREAKS\n\tINTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.\n\n\t\t\tKNIGHT\n\t\tHe chose...poorly.\n\n\tINDY studies the array of chalices.\n\n\n\t                                     ELSA\n\t\tIt would not be made out of gold.\n\n\tINDY picks up another cup\u0097a simple earthenware jug.\n\n\t                                     INDY\n\t\tThat's the cup of a carpenter.\n\n\tHe and ELSA exchange a look.\n\n\t                                     INDY\n\t\tThere's only one way to find out.\n\n\tINDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.\n\tINDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.\n\n\tA strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we\n\tsee his wounds begin to heal.\n\n\t                                    KNIGHT\n\t            You have chosen wisely. But the\n\t            Grail cannot pass beyond the\n\t            Great Seal. That is the boundary\n\t            and the price of immortality.\n\n\n\tCUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.\n\n\tINDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.\n\n\tThe TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put\n\tdown their guns and kneel.\n\n\tINDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to\n\this lips.\n\n\tHENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.\n\n\tHENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his\n\tmouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in\n\tastonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The\n\tcolor returns to Henry's face.\n\n\tHENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then\n\tthey shift to INDY's face\u0097and they light up even more...\n\n\tNAZI SOLDIERS\n\n\trun forward.

ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away\n\tfrom her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT\n\tOPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.\n\n\tELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.\n\tAs her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself\n\tsliding forward across the slanted floor.\n\n\t                                     HENRY\n\t\tJunior!
