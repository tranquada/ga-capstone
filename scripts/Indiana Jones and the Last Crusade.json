The\n\t\"Commanding Officer\" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.\n\n\tOne of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,\n\tbends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tFIRST SCOUT\n</b>\t\tHerman's horsesick!\n\n\tA BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored\n\thair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite\n\tfor knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his\n\tuniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tSCOUTMASTER\n</b>\t\tChaps, don't anybody wander off.\n\t\tSome of the passageways in here\n\t\tcan run for miles.\n\n\tTwo Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.\n\n\tHERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's\n\tdrawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.\n\n\n<b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>               \t\t\tHERMAN\n</b>\t\tI don't think this is such a good\n\t\tidea.\n\n\tLAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.\n\n\tThe VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light\n\tof kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach\n\tcautiously, careful to stay hidden.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHERMAN\n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\tThis is what they see:\n\n\n\tFOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the\n\tpueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called \"Kivas.\"\n\n\tThe men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery\n\tBoy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his\n\tshoulders).\n\n\tAnd the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT\n\tFEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet\n\tanything that this is INDLANA JONES.\n\n\tHowever, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,\n\twe are shocked to discover that it is someone else.\n\n\tWe'll call him FEDORA.\n\n<b>TITLES END.\n</b>\n\tThe TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.\n\n\tNow we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.\n\n<b>                  \t\t               FEDORA\n</b>\t                 \tAlfred, did you get anything yet?\n<b>\t\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAN\n</b>           \t     \tNothing.

I'll think of\n\t\tsomething.\n\n\tINDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees\n\tthe Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for\n\tadditional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of\n\tthe Cross...\n\n\tFEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tFEDORA\n</b>\t\tDig with your hands.\n\n\tINDY picks up the Cross.\n\n\n<b>CONTINUED: (4)\n</b>\n<b>               \t\t\tFEDORA (O .

As he climbs, Indy's\n\tfeet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tROSCOE\n</b>\t\tHe's got our thing!\n\n<b>\t\t\t HALFBREED\n</b>\t\tGet 'im!\n\n<b>                                  \n</b>\n\tThe three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock\n\teach other over in the attempt.\n\n\tOnly FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in\n\tthe direction of his fleeing companions\u0097then sets off\n\tafter INDY.\n\n\n<b>         \n</b><b>\tEXT.

Let's get him! Let's\n\t\tgo!\n\n\tIndy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy\n\tputs two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy\n\tputs the Cross in his belt.\n\n\tINDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But\n\tthe horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a\n\tstanding position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his\n\tback teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.\n\n\tFEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into\n\tthe saddle and gallop off.\n\n\n<b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b> \t\t\tINDY\n</b>\t\tHyahl Hyah!\n\n<b>                     \n</b>\n<b>                                    \t\tROSCOE\n</b>\t\tHey!

Now we glimpse...\n\n\n<b>\tTHE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT\n</b>\n\tThe passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm\n\tis out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from\n\tthe sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in\n\tthe truck.\n\n<b>                                  \t\tPANAMA HAT\n</b>\t\tCome on.

Flying dust. INDY crouched\n\tlow and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin\n\tpumping.\n\n\tINDY VEERS OFF in a new direction\u0097toward a RAILROAD TRACK.\n\n\n<b>\tEXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over\n\this shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he\n<b>\tLEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.\n</b>\n\tHe clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from\n\tthe truck onto the train.\n\n\tHALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed\n\truns after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked\n\ton a flatcar.\n\n\tINDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still\n\trunning after him, Indy enters the trap door of...\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

HALFBREED grabs at\n\tIndy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.\n\n\tThe combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended\n\tfor, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.\n\n\tEveryone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL\n\tBOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's\n\tend of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.\n\n\tHe lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-\n\tto-eye with an\u0097\n\n<b>\tENORMOUS ANACONDA\n</b>\n\tThe head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\n<b>\t\t\tINDY\n</b>\t\tOh...\t\t\n\n\tINDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.\n\n<b>\t\t\tINDY\n</b>\t\tOh...

Almost smother him.\n\n\tINDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.\n\n\tINDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.\n\n\tHALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.\n\tROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tROUGH RIDER\n</b>\t\tHere, let me.\n\n\n\n<b>\tEXT. THE TRAIN- DAY\n</b>\n\tINDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks\n\tworried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and\n\ttosses it away.\n\n\tROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at\n\thim. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...\n\n<b>\tEXT. A FLATCAR - DAY\n</b>\n\tINDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a\n\tlong stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto\n\tthe roof of the rhino boxcar.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

The two struggle,\n\trolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.\n\tThings get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.\n\n\n<b>\tIN THE BOXCAR BELOW\n</b>\n\t... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the\n\tcommotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS\n<b>\tHORN THROUGH THE ROOF.\n</b>\n<b>\tBACK TO THE ROOFTOP\n</b>\n\tas the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and\n\tRoscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.\n\tSMASH!

With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout\n\tdeposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks\n\tup to see FEDORA walking toward him.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tFEDORA\n</b>\t\tCome on, kid.

A bit of sunlight leaks in\n\tthrough the cracks between the boards.\n\n\tThen INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an\n\tAFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust\n\tswirls up into the shafts of sunlight.\n\n\tAnd INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged\n\tfrom his belt during the fall...\n\n\tINDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He\n\tcarefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.\n\n\tINDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP\n\tflying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.\n\n\tThe Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and\n\ttries again. This time\u0097success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion\n\tBELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.\n\n\tINDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs\n\taway even more. Indy inches forward\u0097bends down (never taking his eyes off\n\tthe Lion)\u0097picks up the Cross\u0097and steps back again, sweat pouring down his\n\tface.\n\n\tBut now... how to get out?\n\n\tHe looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING\n\tDOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.\n\n<b>               \t\t\tFEDORA\n</b>\t\tToss up the whip.\n\n<b>\tEXT.
