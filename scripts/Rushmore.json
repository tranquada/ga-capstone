CLASSROOM DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A private day school. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy.\n<br/>\n<br/>The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. ADAMS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Except when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac?\n<br/>\n<br/>A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand\n<br/>\n<br/><b>ISAAC\n<br/></b>\n<br/>What about that problem?\n<br/>\n<br/>Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. ADAMS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Oh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>ISAAC\n<br/></b>\n<br/>How much extra credit is it worth?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. ADAMS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Well, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it,\n<br/>\n<br/>(pause)\n<br/>\n<br/>I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives.\n<br/>\n<br/>There is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row.\n<br/>\n<br/>Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. ADAMS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Max ? You want to try it ?\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks up.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?\n<br/>\n<br/>Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.\n<br/>\n<br/>The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the\n<br/>\n<br/>class.\n<br/>\n<br/>Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods.\n<br/>\n<br/>The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>CUT TO:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.\n<br/>\n<br/>A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around.\n<br/>\n<br/>They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DIRK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Shh.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max's eyes light's up.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Rushmore. You lucked out.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down.\n<br/>\n<br/>Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INSERT HYMNAL:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Rushmore -- best school in country.\n<br/>\n<br/>rich kids -- bad?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Just remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. QUADRANGLE DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students.\n<br/>\n<br/>Dr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back.\n<br/>\n<br/>Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DR. GUGGENHEIM\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Are you free for graduation, Herman? Maybe you could give us an encore. (whistles to the dogs) Nicholas! Copernicus!\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR.

They each notice that their haircuts are identical, neatly parted on the side.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Your speech was excellent. Except I disagree with your ideas about rich kids. Because. After all, we don't choose who our fathers are. But that's really my only criticism.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(hesitates)\n<br/>\n<br/>Thank you.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DIRK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hello.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>This is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR.

Mr. Blume smiles. But Max doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I really. I think it is. You're right about Rushmore. Look around. It truly is a great school.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Anyway, nice to have met you.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away with Dirk.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>What's his name again?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DR. GUGGENHEIM\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Max Fischer.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>He's a sharp little guy.\n<br/>\n<br/>Dr. Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and his chapel partner.

He is carrying the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.\n<br/>\n<br/>He looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables with scissors and paste. Kids watching a movie on science. Kids curled up on mats during naptime.\n<br/>\n<br/>And then he sees room 121. He goes up to the door and looks through the window.\n<br/>\n<br/>A class of first graders is sitting Indian-style in a little circle on the floor.

Gordon gives Mr. Fischer ten dollars.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>GORDON\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Thank you very much.\n<br/>\n<br/>Gordon goes out the door. Mr. Fischer looks at the geometry test.

The big man laughs.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He sets down his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs his knee hard on the edge of the board. He gets up quickly.

Max stands with his architect, smiling for the yearbook photographer. They are holding a banner that says 'Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory Fund-raiser'. Max has on a hard hat. There are two pick-up trucks and a porta-can at the back of the vacant lot.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max digs into the ground with a gold shovel. The shovel has a ribbon around it. Flashbulbs go off.

Max looks up back to his locker and starts throwing his books in the trash again.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume walks over to Max. He looks very sad. He kneels down beside Max. He starts helping him pick up the trash off the floor and put it in the trashcan.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>TITLE:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>October.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT.

He is dressed in his Rushmore uniform, with coat and tie, but his clothes are wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a marine's. His eyes have dark circles around them. He has a little stack of index cards in his hand.\n<br/>\n<br/>The teacher, Mrs. Whitney, stands at the front of the room. She is about fifty with a horn-rimmed glasses and a slight English accent. She has a bemused expression on her face.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MRS WHITNEY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>We have a new student with us today.

His Classmates have no idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back row is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The spine of one of her book covers says Margaret Yang.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>One footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team. I'm going to start one up.

The child has become the father of the man.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks out across the frozen pond. He pulls off his ski cap and feels the cold air against his cheeks.

Miss Cross smiles.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Looks like Max pulled a fast one on us.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume nods.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>How's your aquarium coming along?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Not too bad. It should be finished in October.\n<br/>\n<br/>Miss Cross nods.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I just made a deal with a guy in Singapore for half a dozen electric eels.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>That sounds good.\n<br/>\n<br/>The lights go down. A spotlight appears and Max walks onstage in a tuxedo. He goes to a microphone in the middle of the stage.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I don't usually do this, but this play means a lot to me, and I wanted to make a dedication. So I'll just say that this play is dedicated to the memory of my mother, Eloise Fischer. And to Edward Appleby. A friend of a friend.\n<br/>\n<br/>Neither Mr. Fischer nor Miss Cross were expecting this announcement, and they are moved by it.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Also you'll find a pair of safety glasses and some earplugs underneath your seats. Please feel free to use them. Thank you very much.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max exits the stage and the audience applauds. There is a moment of rustling and whispering in the dark theater.\n<br/>\n<br/>The curtain opens on:\n<br/>\n<br/>Vietnam. Napalm smolders in the sky above the jungle.\n<br/>\n<br/>Dirk runs onstage dressed in a Green Beret uniform and sunglasses. He has an M-16. He yells to Max as Max shimmies down out of a palm tree:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DIRK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Let's rock, Esposito!\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Lock and load, Surf Boy!\n<br/>\n<br/>There is an explosion and Max and Dirk run through the smoke. Suddenly the stage is swarmed by VC regulars. Everyone starts shooting at once.\n<br/>\n<br/>Bursts of gunfire light-up the audience's faces and smoke floats over their heads as we hear the sounds of jets flying over, bombs exploding, choppers taking off, and a SOLDIER'S voice screaming into his radio:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>SOLDIER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mayday! Mayday! Seven niner Almighty! Adjust your coordinates!\n<br/>\n<br/>Some members of the audience put on their safety glasses and earplugs. Woody stands nervously in the wings with a fire extinguisher.\n<br/>\n<br/>One of the extras accidentally clubs Max in the temple with the butt of his rifle. Max's eyes close. He crumples to the floor. The fighting stops. The audience begins to murmur.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max opens his eyes. He sees the frightened soldiers looking down at him.\n<br/>\n<br/>He grabs his M-16 and opens fire. The battle resumes.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Intermission.\n<br/>\n<br/>The sign is leaning on an easel in front of the curtain. Little roses and tulips are painted around its edges.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Actors run around frantically backstage. Max has a band-aid on his forehead. He is touching-up a gory makeup effect over Dirk's eye. He turns to Woody.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>How much time we got, Wood?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>WODDY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(checks his watch)\n<br/>\n<br/>Two minutes.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Bring me some more ketchup.\n<br/>\n<br/>(points to the band-aid on his head)\n<br/>\n<br/>And make this look real.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The lobby of the auditorium is buzzing with people talking about the play and having drinks.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume is standing alone outside, smoking a cigarette. It is snowing softly. Miss Cross comes out with a cup of coffee in each hand. Mr. Blume turns around and looks at her.\n<br/>\n<br/>She goes over to him and hands him one of the coffees.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(sadly)\n<br/>\n<br/>Thank you.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hold this one, too, Herman.\n<br/>\n<br/>He holds both coffees while Miss Cross pours some little containers of cream into then and stirs them with a plastic straw. She takes back her cup of coffee.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>So what do you think of Max's latest opus?\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume gives a thumbs up and stares out into the snow.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Let's just hope it's got a happy ending.\n<br/>\n<br/>Miss Cross smiles. She smoothes her hand across Mr. Blume's hair. He looks into her eyes. She links arms wit him gently and they drink their coffees together.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Max and Magnus Buchan, with a three-day beard and a cigar, stand together among the fallen bodies and smoldering trees.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I want you to have something, Sarge.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max hands Magnus Mr. Blume's silver .45 automatic.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I won't be needing this anymore.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAGNUS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Semper fi, Esposito. Semper fi.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Sic transit gloria, sir.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks out to Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume looks back at him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Say a prayer for Surf Boy. Wherever he is.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAGNUS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Good luck, soldier.\n<br/>\n<br/>Magnus salutes Max and walks off. We hear his voice as he goes into the wings:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAGNUS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD!\n<br/>\n<br/>Max throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife.\n<br/>\n<br/>But then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hello, Esposito.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her.\n<br/>\n<br/>Miss Cross smiles sadly.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks into Margaret Yang's eyes.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(instantly)\n<br/>\n<br/>You bet I will.\n<br/>\n<br/>Wagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion.\n<br/>\n<br/>Dirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of the Army barracks motif.\n<br/>\n<br/>Miss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Max sent you an invitation?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>JOHN\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Thank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MRS. YANG\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Why? Too political?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>No. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Miss Cross, this is my father Bert Fischer. He's a barber.\n<br/>\n<br/>(to Mr. Fischer)\n<br/>\n<br/>This is my friend Rosemary Cross.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISCHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hi, Rosemary.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Nice to finally meet you, Bert.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>And, of course, you know Mr. Blume. I also want everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret.\n<br/>\n<br/>Miss Cross and Margaret smile at each other.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hello, Margaret.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hello, Miss Cross.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>COACH BECK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>ERNIE\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Well, last year he tried to raise piranhas.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>COACH BECK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>What'd you think of the play, Mr. Littlejeans?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>GROUNDSKEEPER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Best play all year, man.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook photographer are having a conversation.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAGNUS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Well, Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' lines.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Really? I didn't notice.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>PHOTOGRAPHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Are Ronny and Donny having a good time at military school?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(instantly)\n<br/>\n<br/>They love it.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAGNUS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Lucky bastards.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Fischer is talking with John.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>JOHN\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I understand you're a neurosurgeon.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISCHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>No. I'm a barber. But a lot of people make that mistake.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Fischer laughs.\n<br/>\n<br/>Dirk and Dr. Guggenheim watch Max laughing and dancing with Margaret Yang. Max points to Dr. Guggenheim. Dr. Guggenheim smiles and points back to him. He says in a hoarse whisper:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DR. GUGGENHEIM\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Who's the Chinaman with Fisher?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DIRK\n<br/></b>\n<br/>That's Margaret Yang. She's actually Korean.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DR. GUGGENHEIM\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(pleasantly surprised)\n<br/>\n<br/>I know the Koreans. They're good people.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max and Margaret are talking as they dance:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>You were incredible tonight, Margaret. You were that poor girl.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Thank you. I loved it when you grabbed onto the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>That was totally improvised.\n<br/>\n<br/>Margaret nods. They look at each other smiling.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Can I ask you a question?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Of course.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Can you do an Australian accent?\n<br/>\n<br/>Margaret looks puzzled. Max smiles.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I'm working on something that's set in the outback.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Fischer is sitting at a table having a glass of champagne with Max's math teacher, Mrs. Whitney. She has a slight English accent. Mr. Fischer wears a sky blue blazer.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISCHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>That's a beautiful dress, by the way.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MRS. WHITNEY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Why, thank you, Bert. That sportscoat is rather smashing in its own right.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISCHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>I know it's a little loud. But I feel like celebrating.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MRS. WHITNEY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Would you care to dance?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISCHER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(surprised)\n<br/>\n<br/>I'd love to.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mr. Blume brings Miss Cross a glass of champagne as Max and Margaret dance by.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hello, Mr. Blume!\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. BLUME\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Hi, Margaret!\n<br/>\n<br/>(to Max)\n<br/>\n<br/>May I cut in? I haven't had a change to cut a rug with your new girlfriend yet.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(embarrassed)\n<br/>\n<br/>New girlfriend.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARGARET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Yes, I am. And find your own partner, Mr. Blume. No offense, but I'm spoken for.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>No, it's OK. He's my friend.\n<br/>\n<br/>Margaret and Mr. Blume dance off together. Max and Miss Cross are left alone.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Well, you pulled it off.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(shrugs)\n<br/>\n<br/>It went OK. At least nobody got hurt.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Except for you.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>(smiles sadly)\n<br/>\n<br/>Nah. I didn't get hurt that bad.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross sips her champagne. She looks back at Max for a minute. She smiles. Mr. Fischer calls out to them as he dances by with Mrs. Whitney:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MR. FISHCER\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Come on, you two! Shake a leg!\n<br/>\n<br/>They wave to Mr. Fischer. Miss Cross looks to Max.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MISS CROSS\n<br/></b>\n<br/>You want to dance?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Certainly. But let's see if we can get the DJ to play something with a lithe ---\n<br/>\n<br/>Max snaps his fingers. He turns to the DJ and yells:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Rueben!\n<br/>\n<br/>The DJ looks to Max. Max makes a little gesture that seems to say, This is the one. The DJ nods.\n<br/>\n<br/>The music cuts off in the middle of the song. Everyone stops dancing. They look around wondering what's going on.\n<br/>\n<br/>A new song starts up. It is the saddest song of the night.\n<br/>\n<br/>Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross puts out her hand. Max takes it and walks with her onto the dance floor, into the crowd, as everyone slowly begins to dance. <br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Rushmore</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Wes Anderson\" title=\"Scripts by Wes Anderson\">Wes Anderson</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Owen Wilson\" title=\"Scripts by Owen Wilson\">Owen Wilson</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Rushmore Script.html#comments\" title=\"Rushmore comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:15:11.138563"}
