CLASSROOM DAY\n\nA private day school. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy.\n\nThe teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.\n\nMR. ADAMS\n\nExcept when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac?\n\nA boy named ISAAC has raised his hand\n\nISAAC\n\nWhat about that problem?\n\nIsaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.\n\nMR. ADAMS\n\nOh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world.\n\nISAAC\n\nHow much extra credit is it worth?\n\nMR. ADAMS\n\nWell, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it,\n\n(pause)\n\nI'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives.\n\nThere is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row.\n\nUnlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.\n\nMax has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMR. ADAMS\n\nMax ? You want to try it ?\n\nMax looks up.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm sorry. Did someone say my name?\n\nEveryone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.\n\nThe boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the\n\nclass.\n\nEveryone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods.\n\nThe classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nMax with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters:\n\nMAX\n\nGentlemen, gentlemen, please.\n\nA little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around.\n\nThey are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips.\n\nDIRK\n\nShh.\n\nMax rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.\n\nMr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYou guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country.\n\nMax's eyes light's up.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nRushmore. You lucked out.\n\nMax leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nNow, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down.\n\nSome of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal.\n\nINSERT HYMNAL:\n\nRushmore -- best school in country.\n\nrich kids -- bad?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nJust remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you.\n\nMr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.\n\nEXT. QUADRANGLE DAY\n\nMr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students.\n\nDr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back.\n\nTwo Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nAre you free for graduation, Herman? Maybe you could give us an encore. (whistles to the dogs) Nicholas! Copernicus!\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(lighting a cigarette)\n\nI don't give a shit. I paid for the whole damn natatorium. The least these little pricks can do is hear me out.\n\nMAX\n\nMr. Blume.\n\nMax has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him.\n\nMAX\n\nMy name's Max Fischer. I just wanted to tell you, I strongly agree with your views concerning Rushmore.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYou don't say. Tell me something. How long have you gone here?\n\nMAX\n\nTen years.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nThen you've been living in a dreamworld for ten years.\n\nMAX\n\nI know it, sir.\n\nMax smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are identical, neatly parted on the side.\n\nMAX\n\nYour speech was excellent. Except I disagree with your ideas about rich kids. Because. After all, we don't choose who our fathers are. But that's really my only criticism.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(hesitates)\n\nThank you.\n\nMr. Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly:\n\nDIRK\n\nHello.\n\nMAX\n\nThis is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(shakes Dirk's hand)\n\nNice to meet you, Dirk.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you for coming today, sir.\n\nMax shakes Mr. Blume's hand. Mr. Blume smiles. But Max doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.\n\nMAX\n\nI really. I think it is. You're right about Rushmore. Look around. It truly is a great school.\n\nMr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.\n\nMAX\n\nAnyway, nice to have met you.\n\nMax goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away with Dirk.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat's his name again?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nMax Fischer.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHe's a sharp little guy.\n\nDr. Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and his chapel partner. He says wistfully:\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nHe's one of the worst students we've got.\n\nINSERT COVER OF THE RUSHMORE YEARBOOK:\n\nIt is called the Rushmore Yankee. The masthead says Max is editor-in-chief. There is a photograph of him laughing, surrounded by his staff.\n\nWe cut to a series of pictures of:\n\nThe French Club, Debate Team, lacrosse, golf, drama, Astronomy Society, Glee Club, student council, Model United Nations, Stamp & Coin Club, Gun Club, Bombardment Society, calligraphy, fencing kung fu, beekeeping, and J.V. water polo.\n\nMax is president or captain of virtually every one of these.\n\nOther photographs show Max pole-vaulting, dancing at the Christmas ball, and giving a thumbs up from the cockpit of a Piper Club.\n\nTITLE:\n\nSeptember\n\nINT. DR. GUGGENHEIM'S OFFICE DAY\n\nA paneled room with wooden floors, an old electric fan in the windowsill, and paintings of ducks and geese on the walls. Dr. Guggenheim is seated at his little oak desk. Max sits across from him and in an antique leather armchair.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nWe're putting you on what we call sudden death academic probation.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nAnd what does that entail ?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nIt entails that if you fail another class, you are going to be asked to leave Rushmore.\n\nMAX\n\nI see.\n\n(raises an eyebrow)\n\nIn other words, I'll be expelled.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nRight.\n\nSilence.\n\nMAX\n\nDr. Guggenheim. I don't want to tell you how to do your job. But the fact is no matter how hard I try, I still might flunk another class. And if that means I have to stay on for a post-graduate year, then so be it. But if --\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nWe don't offer a postgraduate year.\n\nMAX\n\nWell. We don't offer it yet.\n\n(pause)\n\nAnd what about the fact that I'm probably dyslexic?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nYou're not dyslexic.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, I'm a terrible speller.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nJust bring up the grades.\n\nMax sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly:\n\nMAX\n\nDo you remember how I got into this school?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nYeah, I do. You wrote a play.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's right. A little one act. And my mother read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ?\n\nDr. Guggenheim nods.\n\nMAX\n\nDo you regret it?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nNo, I don't regret it. But I still might have to expel you.\n\nMax nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:\n\nMAX\n\nCouldn't we just let me float by? For old times' sake?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\n(grimly)\n\nCan't do it, Max.\n\nEXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY\n\nMax and Dirk come out the door into the cold. They head across the grass.\n\nMAX\n\nThey want to kick me out, Dirk.\n\nDIRK\n\n(concerned)\n\nOh, no. Not again. What are you going to do?\n\nMAX\n\nThe only thing I can do. Try and pull some strings with the administration, I guess.\n\nDIRK\n\n(pause)\n\nMaybe you ought to get a tutor.\n\nMAX\n\nI don't have time for a goddamn tutor. You know my schedule.\n\nINSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:\n\nBACKGAMMON CLUB.\n\nFounder: Max Fischer.\n\nINT. LIBRARY DAY\n\nA long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX.\n\nALEX\n\nDid you hear they're teaching Japanese next year?\n\nMAX\n\nThat's the rumor.\n\nALEX\n\nAnd they're canceling Latin.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat? I tried to get Latin canceled for five years. \"It's a dead language,\" I'd always say.\n\nALEX\n\nWell, I guess they finally heard you.\n\nMax shakes his head as this sinks in.\n\nMAX\n\nAt least I saved Dirk from the horror.\n\nMax turns the page of his book. There is a little note written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it.\n\nINSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK:\n\nwhich reminds me of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is lost.\n\nMax's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex.\n\nMAX\n\nWho's Henry James?\n\nALEX\n\nI don't know.\n\nMax looks back at the book. He studies the quote. He gets up and goes to the check-out counter. He shows the book to the LIBRARIAN.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe librarian reads the Henry James quote.\n\nLIBRARIAN\n\nIt means try to be worldly.\n\nMAX\n\nYou mean like smart.\n\nLIBRARIAN\n\nMore or less. Yeah.\n\nMAX\n\nI'd like to see a list of all the people who've checked out this book in the past year.\n\nThe librarian goes through the cards in a little wooden box.\n\nINSERT SCRAP OF PAPER:\n\nMiss. Cross, 1st grade, room 121\n\nINT. HALLWAY. DAY\n\nMax walks down a hallway in the lower school. He is carrying the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.\n\nHe looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables with scissors and paste. Kids watching a movie on science. Kids curled up on mats during naptime.\n\nAnd then he sees room 121. He goes up to the door and looks through the window.\n\nA class of first graders is sitting Indian-style in a little circle on the floor. The teacher is in a tiny little kids' chair, reading aloud from Kidnapped. She is twenty-eight. She wears a cardigan sweater and her hair pulled back like a ballet dancer. She is MISS CROSS.\n\nMax's eyes are glued to the glass. He cracks open the door an inch to listen to her voice.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI have seen wicked men and fools, a great many of both; and I believe they both get paid in the end.\n\n(darkly:)\n\nBut the fools first.\n\nShe looks up mysteriously. She turns the page and continues:\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nChapter fifteen. The Lad with the Silver Button.\n\nINT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE. DAY\n\nMr. Blume has a gigantic office with paintings of battle scenes and Viking ships, a coat of armor and a statue of a discus thrower. The concrete plant is outside the window.\n\nA portrait of the Blume family hangs on the wall behind Mr. Blume's desk. His wife and twin sons are all fair-skinned redheads. Mr. Blume is dark and sullen. He is smoking a cigarette in the painting.\n\nMr. Blume sits at his desk with a silver military issue. 45 automatic disassembled in front of him. He is cleaning it and drinking a Bloody Mary. His SECRETARY buzzes him on the speakerphone. Mr. Blume pushes a button on it.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYeah?\n\nSECRETARY\n\nMrs. Blume wants you to pick up the twins from school at --\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nTell them to take the fucking bus.\n\nSECRETARY\n\nOK.\n\nINT. CAR. DAY\n\nMax is sitting in a parked Jaguar with Dirk's mother, MRS. CALLOWAY. She is beautiful. She is dressed in tennis clothes and wears a terrycloth visor.\n\nMax is wearing a fluorescent orange crossing guard's belt with a badge at the shoulder that says Patrol Chief. He hands Mrs. Calloway his phone number.\n\nMRS. CALLOWAY\n\nThank you, Max. I told Mr. Calloway the other day how fortunate we are to have someone like you looking out for Dirk.\n\nMAX\n\nMy pleasure. I'm just trying to impart some of the experiences I've accrued to help Dirk. There he is now. Nice talking with you, Mrs. Calloway.\n\nThey shake hands. Max gets out of the car and puts his hand on Dirk's shoulder.\n\nMAX\n\nHow'd the math test go?\n\nDIRK\n\nWhat math test?\n\nMAX\n\nI thought you had a math test today.\n\nDIRK\n\nNo. Did you turn in your paper on the Berlin Airlift ?\n\nMAX\n\nYeah, I got an extension.\n\nDirk gets in the car and drives off. A seventh grader named BOBBY goes over to Max.\n\nBOBBY\n\nHow'd it go?\n\nMAX\n\nI shook hands with her.\n\nBOBBY\n\nBig deal.\n\nMAX\n\nAnd I gave her my phone number.\n\nBOBBY\n\nBuchan said he'd have already banged her by now.\n\nMAX\n\nHe said that?\n\nMax looks across he yard at MAGNUS BUCHAN, the burly foreign exchange student from Scotland. He is seventeen. He has a straw in his mouth and he shoots a little blowdart at a little kid's neck.\n\nHalf of Buchan's ear was blown-off in a hunting accident.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's a really crude thing to say. That's Dirk's mother.\n\nBOBBY\n\nBut I thought that's why you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.\n\nMAX\n\n(looks at Bobby, pause)\n\nWhat are you, a lawyer? All I'm saying is that gorilla is a guest at our school for the year, so respect our women the say way we would in his jerkwater country.\n\nMr. Blume pulls up in a brand new black Bentley.\n\nMAX\n\nMr. Blume!\n\nMax goes over to Mr. Blume's car.\n\nMAX\n\nIt's Max Fischer.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(weary)\n\nHi, Max.\n\nThey shake hands through the open car window.\n\nMAX\n\nHow's the concrete business?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nOh, I don't know. By the time you hit 45 you're been fucked over so many times you don't really care anymore.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm sorry to hear that.\n\nMr. Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat's the secret, Max?\n\nMAX\n\nThe secret?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYeah. You look like you've got it all figured out.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nI don't know. I think you just gotta find something you love to do, then do it for the rest of your life.\n\n(shrugs)\n\nFor me, it's going to Rushmore.\n\nMax looks very serious. Mr. Blume smiles and nods.\n\nMAX\n\nHey, Ronny. Hey, Donny.\n\nMr. Blume's red-headed twins RONNY and DONNY come over to the car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid.\n\nRONNY\n\nShotgun.\n\nDonny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers:\n\nRONNY\n\nI said shotgun, Donny!\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nGet in the back, Ronny.\n\nRONNY\n\nI said, \"Shotgun.\" Get in the back, Donny.\n\nDonny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank up the AC full blast. Mr. Blume's hair dances in the cold burst of air. He shuts off the AC.\n\nMAX\n\nSee you tomorrow, Mr. Blume.\n\n(looks off)\n\nMrs. Reynolds!\n\nMax goes over to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr. Blume looks at Max fondly.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nDid you invite that kid to your party?\n\nDONNY\n\n(shocked)\n\nMax Fischer?\n\nRONNY\n\nCome on, Dad. There's gonna be girls there.\n\nDONNY\n\nI'd rather die. Pull your head out of your ass.\n\nMr. Blume turns Donny quickly like he is going to attack him. Donny cowers grinning in the backseat with his fists up. Ronny pipes in:\n\nRONNY\n\nRemember what Mom said. Hugs not hits.\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM. DAY\n\nThe school auditorium. The stage is bare except for two folding chairs. A tall senior plays FRANK. He is wearing a stocking cap and sunglasses. A fat kid plays WILLIE.\n\nFRANK\n\nWait a second. What time did the old lady place the 911 call?\n\nWILLIE\n\nTen-fifteen.\n\nFRANK\n\n(snaps his fingers)\n\nThat's it.\n\nFrank jumps out of his seat.\n\nFRANK\n\nMeet me on the corner in ten minutes.\n\nWILLIE\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nFRANK\n\nI'll tell you in the squad car.\n\nHe heads towards the wings, then stops.\n\nFRANK\n\nOh, and, Willie. You were wrong about Enrique Sanchez. He died in his sleep.\n\nHe exits.\n\nMAX\n\nExcellent!\n\nWillie looks into the darkness beyond the stage. Max emerges and quickly climbs the steps onto the stage. He is followed by Dirk who is holding a script.\n\nMAX\n\nExcellent. Irving?\n\nThe stage manager is a wavy-haired sophomore named IRVING. He comes out from the backstage. Max pulls some money out of his pocket and hands it to him.\n\nMAX\n\nGet some rootbeers for anybody who wants one. I don't want one. OK. Next scene. (looks at Dirk's script) Frank, you enter stage right with a bag of cocaine.\n\nINT. BARBERSHOP. DAY\n\nA small, clean barbershop. MR. FISCHER is a white-haired man of sixty-five in a white a white barber's shirt. He has finished giving a buzzcut to a twelve year-old boy named GORDON.\n\nGORDON\n\nMay I see the back, please?\n\nMr. Fischer holds up a hand mirror so Gordon can see the back. Gordon nods. Max comes in rolling a Japanese ten-speed at his side.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nHey, Max. How was your day?\n\nMAX\n\nHm. I'd say\n\n(thinks for a second)\n\n98% good, 2% not so good. I need a signature on this geometry test, by the way.\n\nMax leaves his test on the counter and rolls his bike into the back room. Gordon gives Mr. Fischer ten dollars.\n\nGORDON\n\nThank you very much.\n\nGordon goes out the door. Mr. Fischer looks at the geometry test. Max comes out of the back room drinking a glass of chocolate milk with a straw.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nHm.\n\nMAX\n\nI know.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nA 37.\n\nMAX\n\nPathetic. Just pathetic.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nWell. It could have been worse. You were right more than a third of the time.\n\nMAX\n\n(exploding)\n\nCome on, Dad! That stinks! I can do better than that!\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nOf course, you can.\n\nMAX\n\nFor once, will you please try not to look on the bright side?\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nSit down and let me give you a trim.\n\nMax sighs deeply. He sits down. Mr. Fischer signs the geometry test. He puts a pale blue smoke over Max and gives him a haircut.\n\nMAX\n\nDo you think I'm stupid?\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nNo! You're just not very good at math.\n\nMAX\n\nBut I'm failing English and History, too.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\n(pause)\n\nWell. Maybe you'd be better off at a school where there's not so much emphasis on academics.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat, like barber college?\n\nMr. Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly:\n\nMAX\n\nNo, I love Rushmore. I don't want to go someplace second rate. Besides, it would ruin my chances of getting into Oxford.\n\nSilence. Mr. Fischer looks very sad.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nI wish I knew how to help you. But I just don't. I'm sorry, Max.\n\nMax looks at his dad. Mr. Fischer looks down at the floor.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nYou want to see the back?\n\nMAX\n\nNo, thanks. You know how I like it.\n\nINT. THE FISCHER'S HOUSE. NIGHT\n\nAn Archie Bunker-type house. Max and Mr. Fischer sit on the sofa in front of the TV having TV dinners.\n\nMAX\n\nYou think I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays?\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nI don't know. It's possible.\n\nMAX\n\nI should probably be trying harder to score chicks. That's the only thing anybody really cares about. (sighs deeply) But it's not my forte, unfortunately.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nIt'll happen, Max. It's just. You're like one of those clipper ship captains. You're married to the sea.\n\nMAX\n\nYes, that's true.\n\n(pause)\n\nBut I've been out to sea for a long time.\n\nEXT. SOCCER FIELD. DAY\n\nMiss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and searches in her pocket for a lighter.\n\nA lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it. He is wearing a maroon beret, Miss Cross looks at him curiously.\n\nMAX\n\nHello.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHi.\n\nMiss Cross lights her cigarette on Max's match.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI like your hat.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you. You're a teacher here, aren't you?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nUh-huh.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat subject do you teach?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, I teach first grade, so I do all the subjects. Except music.\n\nMAX\n\nAnd this is your first year at Rushmore, I take it.\n\nMiss Cross nods.\n\nMAX\n\nI see. How long have you been a smoker, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(surprised)\n\nHm. Let's see. How old are you?\n\nMAX\n\nFifteen.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nSince I was your age.\n\nMAX\n\n(shocked)\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nMiss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this.\n\nMAX\n\nYou should quit.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou're right.\n\nMAX\n\n(going back to his book)\n\nAnd I should mind my own business.\n\nMiss Cross laughs. Max looks back up.\n\nMAX\n\nWhere'd you go to school, by the way?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHarvard.\n\nMAX\n\nReally? That's a coincidence. My top schools where I want to apply to are Oxford and The Sorbonne. But my safety is Harvard.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(smiles)\n\nThat's very ambitious.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWhat are you going to major in?\n\nMAX\n\nWell. I haven't decided for sure. But probably a double major in Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was your major?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLatin-American studies.\n\nMAX\n\nAh, that's interesting. Did you hear they're not going to teach Latin here anymore?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThis was more like Central America.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nSure. Central America and whatnot. But moving on: they're gonna cancel Latin. They've got to make room for Japanese.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nReally? That's too bad. All the Romance Languages come from Latin.\n\nMAX\n\nThey do, don't they?\n\n(pause)\n\nLike French, probably.\n\nShe nods. She smiles.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nNihilo sanctum estne?\n\nMAX\n\nThat's Latin, isn't it?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYeah.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nIs nothing sacred?\n\nLong pause. Looking right at her.\n\nMAX\n\nSic transit gloria. Glory fades. I'm Max Fischer.\n\nMax slides down the bench and puts out his hand.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHi.\n\nThey shake hands.\n\nINT. LUNCHROOM. DAY\n\nA crowd of MIDDLE SCHOOLERS has gathered around Max. He is holding a clipboard. One of the kids finishes signing a piece of paper on it.\n\nMAX\n\nGood. Now you.\n\n(points to the next kid)\n\nSign here.\n\nThe kid signs.\n\nINSERT PIECE OF PAPER:\n\nA long list of signatures. Many of them are written in little kid's handwriting. Some are neater. Across the top, it says PETITION. This is written in calligraphy.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nThe administration conference room. TEN TEACHERS sit in chairs around a long table. Max stands before them finishing a speech. The petition is tacked-up on the wall behind him.\n\nMAX\n\nIn summation, I have only one question: is Latin dead? Nisilum sacnus (pause, looks at his notecards) estne? Only you can say. Thank you for your time.\n\nApplause.\n\nINSERT ANNOUCEMENT:\n\nThanks to part of the efforts of 10th class member Max Fischer, Latin will now be a required course for grades 7 through\n\nINT. HALLWAY. DAY\n\nMax and a bunch of other kids are reading this announcement on the bulletin board. Max is smiling serenely. The others are cursing and looking at Max with angry faces. Magnus Buchan is one of them. He has a strong Scottish accent.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nBugger off, Fischer. Ya bleedin' little bollocks.\n\nMAX\n\nIs that Latin?\n\nNot bad, Buchan. Maybe you'll place out of your first year.\n\nINT. GYM. DAY\n\nMr. Blume's son Ronny is in a wrestling mach. He has his opponent in a chokehold and is slowly strangling him. Mr. Blume looks on distastefully from the stands. Max is at his side.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat does your dad do, Max?\n\nMAX\n\n(frankly)\n\nHe's a neurosurgeon. Over at St. Joseph's. Personally, I could never see myself cutting open somebody's brain. But he seems to enjoy it.\n\nMax shrugs. Mr. Blume nods.\n\nMAX\n\nYou were in Vietnam, if I'm not mistaken, weren't you?\n\nMr. Blume nods. Max thinks for a minute.\n\nMAX\n\nWere you in the shit?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYeah. I was in the shit.\n\nThey look back out at the wrestling match. Ronny is crushing his opponent's face into the mat with his fist. Mr. Blume shakes his head.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nTell me something, Max. What do you think of Ronny and Donny?\n\nMAX\n\n(automatically)\n\nI like them.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(surprised)\n\nReally?\n\nMAX\n\nSure.\n\nRonny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with his body. Donny screams encouragement.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nNo. You're right. They're good kids.\n\nMax nods solemnly.\n\nWRESTLER\n\nSee you Sunday, Mr. Blume.\n\nA stocky Wrestler with an ice pack on his arm walks by on his way to the showers. Mr. Blume nods to him without looking up.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat's Sunday?\n\nMr. Blume looks to Max. Silence.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nThe twins are having a birthday party. And I'd love it if -\n\nMAX\n\nOh, that's right. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to make it to that one.\n\nMax smiles very sincerely. Silence.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nCome work for me.\n\nMAX\n\n(stiffens)\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI mean, I could use somebody like you. I could -\n\nMAX\n\nI may not be rich, Mr. Blume. And my father may only be a doctor. But we manage.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(hesitates)\n\nI didn't mean it like that. I just -\n\nMAX\n\nNo, thank you. I mean, I appreciate the offer. But I've got everything I need right here at Rushmore. Besides, it wouldn't be fair.\n\nREFEREE\n\n110s!\n\nMAX\n\nExcuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking with you.\n\nMax pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights underneath. Mr. Blume looks surprised.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYou're on the team?\n\nMAX\n\n(shrugs)\n\nI'm an alternate.\n\nMax heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr. Blume calls after him:\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat wouldn't be fair, Max?\n\nMAX\n\n(smiles crookedly)\n\nWe'd make way too much money working on the same team.\n\nMr. Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his match. Max is outclassed and quickly gets pinned.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nMiss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom. They are singing a song as they walk down the corridor. Across the hall, a fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Guggenheim, comes out of her classroom. She is a handsome woman in her late sixties with black and silver hair.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHello, Mrs. Guggenheim.\n\nMRS GUGGENHEIM\n\nHi, Rosemary. Did you find a place?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, I'm just staying over at Edward's parents' house for now. They're out of town.\n\nMRS GUGGENEHIM\n\nOh. That's good.\n\n(pause)\n\nEdward was one of my students, you know.\n\nMiss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points to a photograph in a collage on a wall.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI think I met that boy yesterday.\n\nMrs. Guggenheim looks at the picture.\n\nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH:\n\nIt is black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a show tune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top hat in one hand and cane in the other.\n\nMRS GUGGENHEIM\n\n(frowns)\n\nThat's Max Fischer. How'd you get mixed up with him?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHe introduced himself to me. I liked him, actually.\n\nMRS GUGGENHEIM\n\n(resigned)\n\nYeah, I know. So do I.\n\nEXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nRonny and Donny set upon a pile of birthday presents at a table by the pool. They are surrounded by kids in swimsuits.\n\nMr. Blume sits alone at the next table drinking a whiskey in front of the demolished birthday cake. He has a tattoo on his shoulder that says Semper Fi. There is a bucket of golf balls in front of him and he absently tosses them into the pool one at a time.\n\nHe looks over at Mrs. Blume. She has red hair just like the twins. She is flirting with a pretty boy Tennis Pro. She looks back to Mr. Blume coldly.\n\nMr. Blume gets up and walks around the pool. He pauses to shake hands with a Big Man drinking a glass of Scotch. The big man gives Mr. Blume a sudden shove toward the pool, but hangs on to him so he doesn't fall in. The big man laughs.\n\nMr. Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He sets down his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs his knee hard on the edge of the board. He gets up quickly. There is a bad cut on his knee and he is bleeding. He looks out at the birthday party down below.\n\nPeople begin to notice him up there.\n\nHe sprints down the board, bounces once as high as he can, and sails out long through the air. He tucks into a cannon ball. He nails the water with a huge splash.\n\nMrs. Blume gets up with a bitter look on her face and heads for the ladies' room.\n\nKids gather at the edge of the pool to look down at Mr. Blume playing dead at the bottom with golf balls all around him. A little boy in a Speedo underwear swims to examine Mr. Blume. Their eyes meet. The boy turns and swims away.\n\nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nMiss Cross' classroom. The walls are lined with fish tanks that glow blue and make bubbling sounds. There are maps and pictures everywhere. A model of a 747 hangs from the ceiling. A record player plays the Vienna Boys' Choir at a low volume.\n\nThere is only one Kid in the room. He is taking a test. Miss Cross sits at her desk grading papers.\n\nMax cracks open the door.\n\nMAX\n\nMiss Cross?\n\nMiss Cross and the kid look back at Max. Miss Cross holds her finger to her lips and gets up. As she walks past the kid, she puts her hand on the top of his head. She goes to Max at the door. She whispers:\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHe's taking a make-up test.\n\nMAX\n\nThese guys have tests?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOf course.\n\nMAX\n\nI thought they just did coloring and stuff.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOh, no. They're good readers.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm Max Fischer. We met the other day.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI know who you are. How are you?\n\nMAX\n\nFine, thank you.\n\nMax just stands there.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou want to help me feed the fish?\n\nMAX\n\nYes, please.\n\nMax follows her from tank to tank as she shakes out fish food. They continue to whisper to each other:\n\nMAX\n\nI thought I would just let you know, as per our conversation the other day -\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLatin?\n\nMAX\n\nRight. The Romance Languages. I gave a little speech -\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI heard about this.\n\nMAX\n\nYou did?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nUh-huh. I understand you made a very convincing argument.\n\nMAX\n\nI thought you'd be pleased to hear they're going to continue the Latin program.\n\nShe looks at Max. She sets down the fish food and shakes his hand.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI'm very impressed.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMax picks up the can of fish food and shakes some into one of the aquariums.\n\nMAX\n\nYou need an assistant?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(smiles)\n\nDo we get to have assistants around here?\n\nMAX\n\nI doubt it. I'm on scholarship, though. Academic scholarship. So sometimes, I get to do odd jobs.\n\n(pause)\n\nHow did you decide to teach at Rushmore?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMy husband went here.\n\nMax drops the can of fish food into the tank. He quickly fishes it out.\n\nHe picks some little bits of fish food out of the water and throws them away. Pause.\n\nMAX\n\nI didn't know you were married.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, he's dead now. So I'm not actually married.\n\nMAX\n\nWhen did he die?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLast year.\n\nMax nods. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nMy mother's dead.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOh. I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nMAX\n\nShe died when I was seven. (raising an eyebrow)\n\nSo we both have dead people in our families.\n\nThey look at each other for a minute.\n\nMAX\n\nNow what's going on in here?\n\nMax kneels down and looks into one of the fish tanks. There are a hundred little seahorses swimming around in it.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThose were just born.\n\nA look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the blue water.\n\nMAX\n\nYou really love fish, don't you?\n\nMiss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass.\n\nMAX\n\nHow much do these cost?\n\nINT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE - DAY\n\nMr. Blume's office. HE is talking on the telephone. Max sits in a chair across from him.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI don't want any alloys. I want steel.\n\n(pause)\n\nI don't give a rat's ass if he did. (pause) Steel, Harry.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYou change your mind? You want the job?\n\nMAX\n\nNo. But I've got an idea. And need some money.\n\nMr. Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone.\n\nSECRETARY\n\nMr. Blume, they're ready for you in Hydraulics.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nCome with me. Let's hear your idea.\n\nINT. FACTORY - DAY\n\nMax, Mr. Blume, and a big foreman named Ernie race across the factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're squeezed together with Max in the middle.\n\nMAX\n\nRushmore deserves an aquarium. A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture, and students can study marine life in their natural -\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI don't know. What do you think, Ernie?\n\nERNIE\n\n(skeptical)\n\nAn aquarium?\n\nMAX\n\nA huge aquarium. An entire building.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat kind of fish?\n\nINT. FACTORY - DAY\n\nMr. Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a scaffolding overlooking a huge cat of bubbling concrete.\n\nMAX\n\n(shouting)\n\nElectric eels. Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nPiranhas?\n\nMAX\n\nThat's right. Piranhas. I talked to a man in South America.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nReally. So you might have piranhas.\n\nMAX\n\nWe will have piranhas.\n\nINT. MR BLUME'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nBack in Mr. Blume's office. They're seated as before. Max is still wearing his hard hat.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat does Guggenheim say?\n\nMAX\n\nNothing. I felt I should go to you first.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhy?\n\nMAX\n\nBecause at this moment I feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile. The more preparation I can do, the stronger our case will be when we go to the administration.\n\nLong pause.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHow much do you want?\n\nMAX\n\n$35.000 for the initial plans.\n\nMax holds Mr. Blume's gaze. Mr. Blume picks up a pen.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI'll give you $2500.\n\nMax nods. Mr. Blume writes out a check, tears it off, and hands it to Max. Max sticks it in his pocket like it is a five-dollar bill.\n\nRESEARCH MONTAGE:\n\nAll of the following events occur during school hours.\n\nMax strides across the quadrangle with a determined expression. He's got an armload of books on marine life.\n\nMax watches a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in an empty classroom. Dirk runs the projector.\n\nMax visits a marine research facility and talks with a Scientist. Max holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth.\n\nMax flies over Rushmore in a chopper with Mr. Blume. He shouts out details of the landscape and Mr. Blume nods enthusiastically. They are both eating sandwiches.\n\nThey set down on the soccer field. Kids come running out to meet them. Max waves to them as he jumps out of the chopper. He looks back to Mr. Blume and gives him a thumbs-up. Mr. Blume smiles and waves as the chopper takes off.\n\nMax walks with a young Architect among the trees between the gym and the baseball diamond. They look at some blueprints. Max pulls up third base and slides it over a few feet.\n\nMax points to some beautiful fish in an aquarium in a pet shop. The pet shop Owner reaches in with a little net.\n\nMax pokes his head into Miss Cross's classroom. He holds up two plastic baggies full of water with tropical fish swimming around inside them.\n\nKids gather all around them as they put the new fish into the aquariums. Max smiles mysteriously.\n\nMAX\n\nYou need any help grading papers or anything?\n\nINSERT BOOK REPORT:\n\nThe title is 'Young Ben Franklin'. Miss Cross writes Magnificent! Keep up the good work! And draws two stars across the top of the page with a red pen.\n\nINT. MISS CROSS'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nMax is staring at Miss Cross in a strange from a desk opposite hers in the empty classroom. She looks up at him. He continues to stare at her as if she were a statue.\n\nMiss Cross rubs her eyes and sighs. She sets down her red pen. She looks back at Max. He is still staring at her.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMax?\n\nMax looks quickly down to his papers.\n\nMAX\n\nUh-huh?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nCan I ask you something?\n\nMAX\n\nSure.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHas it ever crossed your mind that you're way too young for me?\n\nMax looks up. Miss Cross smiles faintly. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nIt's crossed by mind that you might consider that a possibility, yes.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nNot to mention that you're a student -\n\nMAX\n\nAnd you're a teacher. And never the twain shall meet. I know, I'm not trying to pressure you into anything, Miss Cross. I'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI just want to make sure -\n\nMAX\n\nWe've become friends, haven't we?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYes.\n\nMAX\n\nGood. That's all that matters to me.\n\nMax thinks for a second, then presses on:\n\nMAX\n\nAnd the truth is neither one of us has the slightest idea where this relationships is going. We can't predict the future.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWe don't have a relationship, Max.\n\nMAX\n\nBut we're friends.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYes. And that's all we're going to be.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's what I meant by relationship. You want me to grab a dictionary?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI just want to make sure we understand each other.\n\nMAX\n\nI understand. You're not attracted to me. C'est la vie. I'm a big boy.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMax. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it.\n\nMAX\n\nIf you say so. All I'm getting at is I've never met anyone like you. Take that for whatever it's worth.\n\nShe thinks about this for a minute.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI think I can safely say I've never met anyone like you, either.\n\nMAX\n\nYou haven't, have you?\n\nMiss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly:\n\nMAX\n\nYou want to shake hands?\n\nShe puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk. But they don't let go. They just look at each other.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm glad we had this conversation.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMe too.\n\nThey finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided.\n\nMAX\n\nBy the way. Are you free? Thursday night?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nFree for what?\n\nMAX\n\nDinner.\n\nShe looks at Max strangely.\n\nMAX\n\nWe're getting a group together after the play.\n\nINSERT PLAYBILL:\n\nSERPICO\n\nA new play by Max Fischer.\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nA very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment.\n\nFour men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'Reilly, Burnum and Fields.

They're feeling me up every day!\n\nO'REILLY\n\nCome on, Frank. You'll have complete protection.\n\nFRANK\n\n(walking off)\n\nI've heard that one before. I got to go put a dime in the meter.\n\nBURNUM\n\nLook, Officer Serpico. If you agree to testify in open court -\n\nFrank wheels around and knocks the clipboard out of O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields instinctively draws his firearm.\n\nFRANK\n\nPromise me one thing, O'Reilly. You're going to follow this all the way. To the end (snaps) Of the line, (snaps) where I got to be.\n\nO'REILLY\n\n(looking Frank right in the eye)\n\nSo help me, God.\n\nThe audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are sitting on the floor very front.\n\nMax watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience.\n\nHe sees Mr. Blume smiling proudly in the third row.\n\nHe sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired Medical Student in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and whispers something back.\n\nMax stares at them blankly as a shoot-out erupts onstage.\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\n\nFrank comes offstage with a bandage of his cheek and a cane in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat happened to the cannoli line?\n\nMax follows Frank as Frank walks quietly toward the dressing room.\n\nMAX\n\nYou're supposed to say, \"Forget about it, Sanchez -\"\n\nFRANK\n\n(very angry)\n\nI made a mistake, all right? It doesn't make any difference, anyway.\n\nMAX\n\nHey, I'm letting it go. But don't tell me it doesn't matter. Every line matters.\n\nFRANK\n\n(yelling)\n\nGet off my back!\n\nMAX\n\nDon't fuck with my play!\n\nFrank turns around and punches Max in the nose. Max takes a swing and misses and they wrestle as people try to break it up.\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nThe whole cast is onstage bowing as the audience applauds. Some of the actors motion to the wings.\n\nMax walks out on the stage. He has a bloody Kleenex in each nostril. He waves to the audience. The applause roars.\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe crowded dressing rooms. Actors are taking off their make- up. Max is drinking a champagne cocktail and talking with his father and an elderly Woman.\n\nWOMAN\n\nI thought the acting tonight was excellent.\n\nMAX\n\nIt was better in rehearsals.\n\n(to his father)\n\nI'll catch up with you later, Dad. I've got a dinner to go to.\n\nMR FISCHER\n\n(interested)\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nYeah. Cast and crew only.\n\nMr. Fischer feels left out but tries not to show it.\n\nMR FISCHER\n\nOK. Well, have a good time.\n\nMiss Cross walks over to Max through the crowd. Her friend the medical student follows behind her. Max's expression is polite but inscrutable.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThat was great, Max.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm so glad you could come.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI want you to meet a friend of mine. John Coats. Max Fischer.\n\nMAX\n\n(not looking at him)\n\nWho's this guy?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(pause)\n\nJohn.\n\nMax looks at John. John smiles. Pause.\n\nJOHN\n\nI really liked your play, man. It was really cool.\n\nMax nods. He drinks a long sip of his champagne cocktail.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWhat happened to your nose?\n\nMAX\n\nI got punched in the face.\n\n(to John)\n\nWhat's your excuse?\n\nMr. Blume comes over to them.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nAm I going to get to meet your dad tonight, Max?\n\nMAX\n\nNah. The old man's on call tonight. Mr. Blume, I'd like you to meet Miss Cross, and I didn't catch this young gentleman's name.\n\nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nA fancy restaurant. Max is having dinner with Mr. Blume, Miss Cross and John. Max is drunk.\n\nMAX\n\nI like your nurse's uniform, guy.\n\nJOHN\n\nThey're OR scrubs.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nOR they?\n\nMr. Blume laughs suddenly and wine goes up his nose. Max glances to him slyly, then looks back at John.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, they're totally inappropriate for the occasion.\n\nJOHN\n\nWell, I didn't know we were going to dinner.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's because you weren't invited.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nTake it easy, Max.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(angry)\n\nYou're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat's wrong with that? I can write a hit play. Why can't I have a drink when I want to unwind a little? So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross?\n\nJOHN\n\nWe went to Harvard together.\n\nMAX\n\n(shrugs)\n\nAnd I wrote a hit play. And directed it. So I'm not sweating it, either.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(signaling the waiter)\n\nI'm going to get the check.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat do you think you're doing?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI'm getting the -\n\nMAX\n\nNo, you're not.\n\nThe Waiter comes over. Max intercepts him:\n\nMAX\n\nI just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us. We only expected to be a party of three, but somebody invited himself along. I apologize.\n\nWAITER\n\nThat's perfectly all right.\n\nThe waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou're being rude, Max.\n\nMAX\n\nNo I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out why you brought this gentleman to my play. And my dinner, which was invitation only.\n\nJohn reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his spoon and swats John on the back of the hand.\n\nMAX\n\nWould you like me to pass you the butter?\n\nMax hands John the butter.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\nMAX\n\n(raising his voice)\n\nWhat's wrong with YOU?\n\nMax is making a scene. People all over the restaurant are watching. Max stares at Miss Cross.\n\nMAX\n\nYou hurt my feelings. This night was important to me.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHow did I hurt your feelings?\n\nMAX\n\nI wrote a hit play!\n\n(pause)\n\nAnd I'm in love with you.\n\nJohn looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max looks drunk and dejected.\n\nMAX\n\nHow do you like that, Curly?\n\nEXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY\n\nMiss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting pictures.

I shouldn't have let him drink.\n\nMiss Cross nods. Silence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI don't think I should see Max anymore.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHe's not going to like the sound of that.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI know. But I think I let him get too attached.\n\nMr. Blume nods.

Max stands with his architect, smiling for the yearbook photographer. They are holding a banner that says 'Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory Fund-raiser'. Max has on a hard hat. There are two pick-up trucks and a porta-can at the back of the vacant lot.\n\nMax digs into the ground with a gold shovel. The shovel has a ribbon around it. Flashbulbs go off. Everyone claps. Max waves Dirk over.\n\nMAX\n\nDid you see her?\n\nDIRK\n\nShe's not here.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, see if she's in her classroom.\n\nThe Contractor walks over to Max.\n\nCONTRACTOR\n\nShould we go ahead and take care of this tree?\n\nMAX\n\nLet's wait a few minutes.\n\nCoach Beck goes over to Max. He is six four and wears a John Newcombe mustache and an Adidas warm-up. He is frowning.\n\nCOACH BECK\n\nWhat's going on here, Maxie?\n\nMAX\n\nCoach Beck. Good to see you. This is where they're building the new aquarium. I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it.\n\nCOACH BECK\n\nThis is the baseball diamond.\n\nMAX\n\nI believe it's being relocated a few feet over.\n\nCOACH BECK\n\n(frowns)\n\nI should've been informed about that.\n\nCoach Beck walks off. Max answers some questions for the School Reporters.\n\nREPORTER\n\nIs it true the aquarium will have piranhas?\n\nMAX\n\n(smiles)\n\nWhere'd you hear that?\n\nREPORTER\n\nMy source indicated that it was a possibility.\n\nMAX\n\nYes, it's true. Excuse me, George.\n\nDirk has returned.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nDIRK\n\n(a little wary)\n\nShe has a substitute teacher today.\n\nMAX\n\nWhy?\n\nDIRK\n\nShe probably got sick.\n\nMAX\n\n(looks away)\n\nYou know she's not sick. Give me the phone.\n\nMax dials on a cellular phone.\n\nMAX\n\nHi, Janet. It's Max Fischer.\n\nIs Mr. Blume there?\n\n(pause)\n\nWell, where is he?\n\n(pause)\n\nGoddammit, he's supposed to be here.\n\nLet me know if you find him, please.\n\nMax hangs up. He looks off and says in a steely voice:\n\nMAX\n\nI'm going anyway.\n\nMax goes over to the contractor.\n\nMAX\n\nChop it down, Mr. Chandler! We've got an aquarium to build.\n\nMax talks to another reporter.\n\nMAX\n\nI don't give a shit about barracudas. But fuck it. I'm building it anyway.\n\nThe sound of power saws fills the air as Dr. Guggenheim appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a Security Guard with a walkie-talkie. DR Guggenheim screams:\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nMax!\n\nDR. Guggenheim sees the chopped-down trees and mangles baseball field as he strides on to the lot.\n\nMAX\n\nNice to see you, Dr. Gugg-\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nMax!\n\n(seizing Max by the arm)\n\nWhat do you think you're doing?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nWe're having a fund-raiser for-\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nShut those damn things off!\n\nThey turn off the power saws.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nTell me this isn't happening.\n\nMAX\n\nDr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have this conversation in front of the crew.\n\nEXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY\n\nDirk waits nervously on the steps in front of DR. Guggenheim's office. He holds a hamster in his hands.\n\nHe gets up and goes to the windows. He looks inside.\n\nMax is sitting in a little chair in the middle of the room with his hard hat on. DR. Guggenheim and several other faculty members sit around him. DR. Guggenheim is screaming at him across his desk. Max is crying.\n\nDirk looks scared.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nMax kneels on the floor in the hallway, emptying out his locker. Papers and trash are scattered all around him. There is a trashcan beside him. He is throwing away his books, one at a time.\n\nMr. Blume opens the door at the end of the hallway. Max looks up at him. Silence. Max looks up back to his locker and starts throwing his books in the trash again.\n\nMr. Blume walks over to Max. He looks very sad. He kneels down beside Max. He starts helping him pick up the trash off the floor and put it in the trashcan.\n\nTITLE:\n\nOctober.\n\nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n\nGrover Cleveland is a public high school with two thousand five hundred students.\n\nMax sits in a front row of a math classroom. He is dressed in his Rushmore uniform, with coat and tie, but his clothes are wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a marine's. His eyes have dark circles around them. He has a little stack of index cards in his hand.\n\nThe teacher, Mrs. Whitney, stands at the front of the room. She is about fifty with a horn-rimmed glasses and a slight English accent. She has a bemused expression on her face.\n\nMRS WHITNEY\n\nWe have a new student with us today. His name's Max Fischer and he's actually asked to say a few words to the class. Max? You want to take it away?\n\nMAX\n\n(standing up)\n\nSure. Thanks very much. I just wanted to introduce myself.\n\nMax looks quickly at his notecards.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm Max Fischer. I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy, which I recently got expelled from.\n\nMax flips to the next notecard.\n\nMAX\n\nThis is my first time in a public school. And I know you probably think I was born with a silverspoon in my mouth. But I'm no elitist. I think you've got some great facilities, and I'm really looking forward to making the best of it over here at Grover Cleveland.\n\nMax sighs deeply. He rubs his eyes. His Classmates have no idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back row is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The spine of one of her book covers says Margaret Yang.\n\nMAX\n\nOne footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team. I'm going to start one up. Let me know if you'd like to join. Thanks.\n\nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n\nThe wide halls of Grover Cleveland High School are lined with orange lockers. A banner stretched down the wall says 'Murder the Mustangs'. A bustling throng of high schoolers rush to class.\n\nMax walks slowly, alone, down the middle of the hall. A blonde cheerleader-type Girl asks him:\n\nGIRL\n\nWhy are you so dressed up?\n\nMax looks down at his clothes. Max looks back to the girl.\n\nMAX\n\nAre you insane?\n\nThe girl walks off. Margaret Yang catches up to Max.\n\nMARGARET\n\nMax?\n\nMAX\n\nYes?\n\nMARGARET\n\nHi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class. I just wanted to tell you I liked your speech. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking to give a speech in class before.\n\nMAX\n\nHow unfortunate.\n\nMARGARET\n\nThe silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way. But I think I know how you meant it.\n\nMAX\n\nGlad to hear it. Goodbye, Miss Chang.\n\nMax ducks into the men's room. Margaret walks quietly away.\n\nINT. GYMNASIUM - DAY\n\nA tiny figure dressed all in white stands alone at the far end of the huge gymnasium with a fencing oil. He lunges, parries, and thrusts.\n\nThe basketball team suddenly floods dribbling into the gymnasium, throwing passes and taking free throws. Max stops fencing as they take over the room. He watches them in silence. He shakes his head. He walks off the court.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nMax puts a quarter in a pay phone. He is still wearing his fencing costume.\n\nMAX\n\nJanet. Max Fischer. Is he in?\n\nEXT. RUSHMORE - DAY\n\nMr. Blume answers on his cellular phone as he gets out of his car and walks across the lawn at Rushmore.\n\nWe intercut the two of them.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHey, Max. How's it going over there?\n\nMAX\n\nTerrible. Tell me something. When you talk to Miss Cross the other\n\nday, did you get the feeling-\n\nThe hall monitor Mr. Holstead comes down the hall toward Max. He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a striped tie and his sleeves rolled up.\n\nMR HOLSTEAD\n\n(loudly)\n\nDo you have a telephone pass?\n\nMax holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume.\n\nMr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms. Kids look out at him curiously.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI got to tell you, Max. I don't know what you see in her. I don't think she's right for you.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nMr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares at her in a glance. He whispers:\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWell, she's not that beautiful. She's not that interesting. I mean, sure, there's something about her. But I see you with someone-\n\nMAX\n\nLook, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable, but let's get to the point. Will she see me again? Yes or no?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(pause)\n\nNo.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm going to go see her. Hang on.\n\nMax looks to Mr. Holstead.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm talking on the telephone.\n\nMr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone.\n\nMAX\n\nCome on, man. That's rude.\n\nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n\nMrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window at:\n\nMax opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away.\n\nEXT. RUSHMORE - DAY\n\nMax rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward the bike racks standing on one pedal.\n\nMax locks up his bike and walks across the lawn.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nYou better beat it, laddie.\n\nMax looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife.\n\nMAX\n\nI hope you fall out of that tree and get stick in the ass, Buchan.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nYou know, I've watched you, Fischer. Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk cause his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere. Like everything you do. Big show. No results.\n\nMAX\n\nAnd what do you call getting a hand job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar?\n\nMAGNUS\n\nA bloody lie.\n\nMAX\n\nYou think I got kicked out for just the aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It was the hand job. And I'll tell you another thing. It was worth it. So eat your heard out, mick. I got business to attend to.\n\nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nMiss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon and digs in her bag for the keys.\n\nMAX\n\nOr do you want me to go?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(looks around, sighs)\n\nYou can talk to me.\n\nMiss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and they stand there in silence.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThat's OK.\n\nMAX\n\nNo, it's not. And please apologize to what's his name for me.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI will. Are you OK?\n\nMAX\n\nI'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I miss the seasons. And watching the leaves change.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nBut it's only three blocks away.\n\nMAX\n\nI know. I miss seeing you.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(pause)\n\nI miss you, too.\n\nMax looks off into the trees. A squirrel leaps from one branch to another. Max smiles and shakes his head. A crashing noise is heard from the roof of the planetarium. Someone ducks for cover, but Max and Miss Cross don't see him.\n\nMax reaches into his backpack and says mysteriously:\n\nMAX\n\nBy the way, what time does the library close? I got an overdue book to turn in.\n\nMax takes out the Jacques Cousteau library book and hands it to Miss Cross. She looks at it and starts to say something but she stops. She opens the book and looks at it in silence.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's your handwriting, isn't it?\n\nMax shows her the Henry James quote. Miss Cross nods.\n\nMAX\n\nNot bad. Except it's probably bad form for a teacher to write in a library book.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nIt wasn't a library book when I wrote in it.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI gave this book to Rushmore.\n\nMax looks puzzled. Miss Cross shows him a little card inside the front cover of the book.\n\nINSERT LIBRARY BOOK:\n\nIn Memory of EDWARD APPLEBY\n\nClass of '87\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMy husband gave me this book in the seventh grade. And he went to Rushmore. So when he died I put it in the library here.\n\nMAX\n\nSo that's who that is. Edward Appleby.\n\n(looks to Miss Cross)\n\nYou already knew him in the seventh grade?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI knew him all my life.\n\n(looks to Max)\n\nYou remind me of him, you know?\n\nMAX\n\nI do? How?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell. Weren't you in the Rushmore Beekeepers?\n\nMAX\n\n(frowns)\n\nYeah. I was President of them.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHe founded that club.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nI get your meaning. I founded a few clubs myself in my day.\n\nAn acorn falls on Max's head. He looks up. There is no one there, but a scurrying sound is heard. Max frowns.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat was that? A squirrel?\n\nMr. Blume is crouched just out of view on the roof. He looks back over his shoulder and sees a small, white-haired, Indian GROUNDSKEEPER looking at him. The groundskeeper is holding a rake. Mr. Blume rises slowly. He whispers:\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nIs this the natatorium?\n\nThe groundskeeper frowns and shakes his head.\n\nMAX\n\nDo you think we can be friends again, Miss Cross? In a strictly platonic way?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOf course, I do. Do you think you can make a go of it and settle down at Grover Cleveland?\n\nMAX\n\nYeah. But I need a tutor.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI'll be your tutor.\n\nMAX\n\n(looking into her eyes)\n\nYou will?\n\nMiss Cross smiles and nods.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you.\n\n(pause)\n\nWhat are you doing tomorrow?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nMr. Blume sitting at the desk in his office. Max yells at him over the speakerphone:\n\nMAX\n\nShe's taking me to a field trip!\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(hesitates)\n\nGreat! You need anybody to chaperone?\n\nMAX\n\nYou'd take time out of your business to do that?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nBusiness schmizness.\n\nOCTOBER MONTAGE:\n\nMax and Miss Cross ride in the backseat of a van full of first graders. Max is telling a story and everyone is laughing. Mr. Blume is up front quietly driving the van. One of the first graders sits in the passenger seat staring at him. They go through the front gates of the zoo.\n\nMiss Cross stands at the front of her classroom drawing a complicated geometric proof on the chalkboard. Max sits alone across from her nodding earnestly and taking notes.\n\nMax and Miss Cross play doubles against Mr. Blume and Dirk on the court in the Blume's backyard. Max coaches Miss Cross on her backhand. Mr. Blume watches her from across the net. Mrs. Blume watches all of them from an upstairs window.\n\nThe Grover Cleveland Science Fair. Max sits proudly in front of his project. It is a paper mache tidal wave looming over a little coastal village with screaming peasants.\n\nMargaret Yang is across the aisle being photographed with a trophy for Best of Show. Her project is called Light, Color, Sound and Magnetism. She is staring at Max, but he doesn't notice her.\n\nMrs. Whitney hands Max a geometry test. It has a C+ on it. Max looks quickly to Mrs. Whitney, surprised. She smiles and shakes his hand.\n\nA huge banner for the Grover Cleveland Owls is stretched across the endzone of the football field. Max, dressed in a shiny blue and grey jumpsuit, bursts through the banner and onto the field doing cartwheels and flips. The football teams scrambles out behind him.\n\nMax points out to different parts of the crows and yells football cheers. Dirk is sitting in between Mr. Blume and Miss Cross in the stands. Mr. Blume stares at Miss Cross. Miss Cross looks back and Mr. Blume and smiles. Dirk says significantly:\n\nDIRK\n\nWhere's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume?\n\nAnd your sons Ronny and Donny?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI haven't the slightest idea, Dirk.\n\nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL.

She is very nicely dressed in a grey turtleneck.\n\nMARGARET\n\nHi, Max.\n\nMAX\n\nHi.\n\nMax keeps walking.\n\nHe stops. He turns back to Margaret Yang. He looks her up and down. She is slightly uneasy. Max looks to Woody. Woody shrugs. Max looks back to Margaret.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat was your name again?\n\nMARGARET\n\nMargaret Yang.\n\nMAX\n\nAre you free seventh period?\n\nMARGARET\n\nWell, I'm supposed to have guitar lessons.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nClassical?\n\nMARGARET\n\nRock.\n\nMAX\n\nYou can get out of it.\n\n(to Woody)\n\nput Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody.\n\nMax turns away and walks briskly down the hall with his entourage. He calls back to Margaret:\n\nMAX\n\nAnd bring a headshot.\n\nEXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. DAY\n\nA nice two story house with a wide lawn and lots of trees. Mr. Blume knocks on the front door and waits nervously. He looks around the yard with his hands in his pockets.\n\nThe door opens. Miss Cross is holding a plate of sliced carrots. She looks at Mr. Blume curiously and smiles.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHi, Herman.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHow are you, Rosemary?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nFine, thanks. I just got home and I'm having a little snack.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHaving some carrots.\n\nMiss Cross nods. Mr. Blume looks up at the house.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nNice house.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYeah, This isn't mine. I'm' just kind of housesitting.\n\n(pause)\n\nWere you in the neighborhood?\n\nMr. Blume nods. There is an awkward silence.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nDidn't Max have anything planned for us today? A trip to the museum or something?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nDid he? I thought he was rehearsing this evening.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nOh. That's right. His new play. He's going to be in this one, isn't he?\n\nMiss Cross nods. Mr. Blume shakes his head.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHe's really making a go of it over at Grover Cleveland.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI think he's on track. It's nice, isn't it?\n\nMr. Blume nods. Silence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou want a carrot?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYeah. I'll have one of those.\n\nMr. Blume takes one of the carrots and has a bite of it. Miss Cross watches him chewing. She smiles slightly.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWell. Max had said something about us all going to the horseraces, so I'm sure I'll see you soon.\n\nMiss Cross nods. Mr. Blume takes another bite of his carrot and throws the rest of it into the yard. Miss Cross laughs. Mr. Blume smiles and shrugs. He starts to go.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOr we could go for a walk, if you want.\n\nMr. Blume stops and turns around quickly.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nSure.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nIt's nice out, don't you think?\n\nKind of brisk.\n\nMr. Blume nods.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLet me get a sweater. I'll be right back.\n\nShe goes inside.

DAY\n\nMr. Blume is parked at the curb, staring off into space. Ronny and Donny jump into the car and slam the doors.\n\nRONNY\n\nLet's go.\n\nMr. Blume automatically puts the car in gear. He slams on the brakes. Dirk is standing in front of the car, blocking them. He stares at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume rolls down his window.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nDirk?\n\nDirk does not budge. Mr. Blume gets out of the car and leaves it idling. He closes the door.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nDirk? What's wrong?\n\nDIRK\n\nI know about you and the teacher.\n\nSilence. Mr. Blume looks very worried.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nDoes Max know?\n\nDIRK\n\nNo. And I don't want him to know. I just want it to stop. Right now.\n\nThey stare at each other.\n\nDIRK\n\nYou're a married man, Blume. And you're supposed to be his friend.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nLook, Dirk. I am his friend -\n\nDIRK\n\nYeah. And with friends like you, who needs friends?\n\nDirk turns and walks off. Mr. Blume looks puzzled.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nMr. Blume sighs. He turns around and tries to open the car door. Ronny and Donny have locked him out of the car. He can see them inside laughing. He says fiercely:\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nUnlock it!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nDirk walking across the lawn with a hard look on his face. He walks past Magnus Buchan. Magnus is throwing Chinese throwing stars at a tree trunk.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nLittle Calloway\n\nDirk stops and looks to Magnus.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nYou're standing up for the wrong bloke. Fischer ain't your mate.\n\nDIRK\n\n(angry)\n\nWhat are you talking about, Buchan?\n\nMAGNUS\n\n(shrugs)\n\nHe thinks your mum's good for a bonk. That's why he picked you as his chapel partner.\n\nDirk looks deeply wounded. But he doesn't want to believe it:\n\nDIRK\n\nWho sold you that crock?\n\nMAGNUS\n\nHe told me himself. He says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.\n\nDIRK\n\nMax would never say that.\n\nMAGNUS\n\n(smiles)\n\nYeah. You're probably right. After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody.\n\nBuchan laughs wickedly and fires off another throwing star.\n\nINT. GROVE CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL.

OK.\n\n(pointing to the messenger)\n\nIs that for me?\n\nThe messenger gives Max the envelope. Max opens it.\n\nINSERT LETTER:\n\nWritten neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm.\n\nDear Max,\n\nI'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I saw them frenching at the museum, and then I knew for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because you're such a good friend. Take care, pal.\n\nFondly,\n\nDirk Calloway\n\nEXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT\n\nMr. Blume puts on his jacket as he walks down the front path from Miss Cross' house. He gets in his Bentley and starts the engine.

Are you comfortable, Max? I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(frowns)\n\nWe never went skipping dipping.\n\nMAX\n\nSure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(pause)\n\nI'm in love with her.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, I was in love with her first. And all that crap about, I don't think she's that great, I don't think she's right for you, Max. That was all bullshit, wasn't it?\n\nSilence.\n\nMAX\n\nDo you think she's in love with you?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI don't know.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, I guarantee you she's not.\n\nAnd she never will be.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nLook, Max -\n\nMAX\n\nI saved Latin!\n\nMax glares at Mr. Blume.

A LAWN CREW is raking in the background.\n\nMax strikes a match, throws it on the leaves, and watches sadly as the leaves burn and smoke rises black into the crisp autumn air. He takes off his Rushmore blazer and throws it on the fire. He looks up at the sky and says quietly:\n\nMAX\n\nSic transit gloria, Mr. Blume.\n\nSic transit gloria.\n\nEXT. PARK. DAY\n\nA cold day. Dry leaves fall from the trees in the park.\n\nMr. Blume comes down the path to Max sitting alone on a bench. Max is dressed in blue jeans, a plaid shirt, a ski cap, and huge down parka.

As you know, Mr. Blume and I used to be friends.\n\nMRS. BLUME\n\nI have no idea what the relationship is between you and Herman. Honestly, I find it very bizarre.\n\nMAX\n\n(taken aback)\n\nWhat do you mean to imply?\n\nMRS. BLUME\n\nI'm not implying anything. You make a very strange couple. It's too bad Herman doesn't have that kind of affection for his own children.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, I'm sure he does.\n\nMRS. BLUME\n\nNo, he doesn't.\n\nMAX\n\nI know you don't really mean that.\n\nMRS.

Get to the point.\n\nMAX\n\nGladly. Your husband's fucking a schoolteacher, pardon my French. I thought you should know.\n\nSilence.\n\nMRS. BLUME\n\nWhy are you telling me this? Are you trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you trying to hurt me?\n\nMAX\n\nI have no reason to want to hurt you.\n\nMRS. BLUME\n\nThen you're trying to hurt Herman.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's correct.\n\nINT.

I might want to take a dip before dinner.\n\nCONCIERGE\n\nIt's on the roof, sir.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nTerrific!\n\nMr. Blume gets on the elevator with the bellman. The bellman looks at him and smiles.\n\nBELLMAN\n\nYou certainly seem happy today, sir.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYou bet your little ass I am, shorty. I lost my family. But I gained a woman I love.\n\nBELLMAN\n\nNot a bad tradeoff.\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY\n\nThe living room of Mr. Blume's suite.

He swats it away and keeps reading.\n\nTwo more bugs come buzzing around him. Mr. Blume looks up and frowns. They're bees. Mr. Blume slaps at his neck and jumps to his feet as he gets stung.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nShit!\n\nBees are circling all over the room. Mr. Blume looks around frantically. He sees something at the bottom of the front door. It is a little plastic tube with bees crawling out of it and taking off.\n\nINT. BASEMENT.

The car pops through a wooden fence and rolls across the grass into the quadrangle.\n\nThe Indian groundskeeper is raking leaves as the car goes past him. He watches as it crunches over some bushes and scrapes against a stone wall. It rolls to a stop in the middle of the quad.\n\nMr. Blume gets out of the car and looks at the damage.

It is Halloween and there is a jack-o-lantern on the steps. Lots of kids are dressed in costumes.\n\nSuddenly, Max is being pelted with rocks. He looks around frantically and sees Dirk and a longhaired kid named TOMMY STALLINGS as they set upon him.\n\nDirk is dressed as a sorcerer. Tommy has on a karate outfit with a black belt. Max runs for cover behind some bushes.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat are you doing? Are you crazy?\n\nDIRK\n\nYou're trespassing! This is private property!\n\nMore rocks sail past Max. A pinecone hits him on the head.\n\nMAX\n\nWait a minute! Stop!\n\nMax raises his hands in the air. Dirk motions for Tommy to hold his fire. Max slowly stands up.\n\nMAX\n\nLet's have a truce for a second. I want to talk.\n\nThey meet out in the open. Tommy follows with a rock in each hand. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat's this all about?\n\nDirk stares at Max or along minute.\n\nDIRK\n\nDid you say my mother gave you a hand job?\n\nMAX\n\n(shocked)\n\nWhat?\n\nDIRK\n\n(steely)\n\nDid you say it?\n\nMAX\n\nWho told you that goddamn lie?\n\nSilence.\n\nMAX\n\nNever mind.

He stares at Max stonily. There is a manila envelope on the table in between them.\n\nMAX\n\nDid you receive the package?\n\nDr. Guggenheim motions to the envelope. Max nods.\n\nMAX\n\nGood. I just wanted to inform you about what's going on.\n\nDr. Guggenheim stares at Max with contempt.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nI never took you for an informer, Max.\n\nMAX\n\n(frowns)\n\nWhat's that suppose to mean?\n\nSilence. Max reaches out to take the envelope. Dr. Guggenheim slams his hand on it and leans across the table at Max.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\n(fiercely)\n\nShe resigned this morning.\n\nBefore I even got your little snapshots. So your latest attempt at sabotage has backfired.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nBut she's one of the best teachers you've got.\n\n(yelling)\n\nHow could you let her resign?\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nWhy are you trying to get her fired?\n\nMAX\n\nYou stupid old fool! I'm trying to win her back!\n\nDr. Guggenheim starts coughing and turning red.

Silence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHi, Max.\n\nMAX\n\nYou need any help?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nNo. I have it.\n\nShe pricks her finger and holds it to her mouth.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nDammit.\n\nMax starts to go in the room to help her.\n\nMAX\n\nHere. Let me see.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nNo. Please, don't come in here. Look. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you. But just. Please, Max.\n\nMiss Cross has tears in her eyes. Max goes slowly toward her.\n\nMAX\n\nYou honestly believe you love Blume instead of me?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYes.\n\nMAX\n\nYou'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nStop. If you don't stop with that ping-pong talk, I'm going to lose it. Do you understand me?\n\nMax takes Miss Cross' hand and kisses it. She pulls her and away. Max tries to embrace her. They struggle and Miss Cross overpowers Max. She holds his arms behind his back.\n\nMAX\n\nLet me go!\n\nMax struggles some more. Miss Cross pushes him hard across the room. Max smashes into some chairs and knocks over a desk. He yells at her:\n\nMAX\n\nI got kicked out because of you!\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou got kicked out because -\n\nMAX\n\nRushmore was my life. Now you are!\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThat's bullshit!\n\nSilence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWhat do you really think is going to happen between us? You think we're going to have sex?\n\nMax looks shocked.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\n(pause)\n\nNot if you've never fucked before, it isn't.\n\nMAX\n\n(stunned)\n\nOh, my God.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHow would you put it to your friends? Do you want to finger me? Or maybe I could give you a hand job in the back of a Jaguar. Would that put an end to all of this?\n\nMiss Cross moves towards Max with her hand outstretched. Max retreats backwards, banging into desks and chairs. Miss Cross stops.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nPlease. Get out of my room.\n\nMax walks out of the room and stands in the doorway.\n\nMiss Cross turns away and goes back to taking down her maps from the wall. Max watches her for a minute.\n\nMax leaves.\n\nEXT. QUADRANLGE. DAY\n\nMax comes out the door of the lower school in a daze. Magnus Buchan is sitting on a bench eating some candy.

BLUME\n\nYou wanted to meet?\n\nMAX\n\nWhen?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nRight now. You said you wanted to meet to put an end to this nonsense.\n\nMAX\n\nOh. Yeah. I was going to try and have that oak tree fall on you.\n\nMax jerks him thumb over his shoulder. Mr. Blume looks at a massive oak tree hanging precariously by the roots.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nThat big one? That would have really pancaked me.\n\n(pause)\n\nWhat stopped you?\n\nMAX\n\n(shrugs)\n\nWhat's the use? She loves you.\n\nMax gets up. They look at each other in silence.\n\nMAX\n\nSo long Mr. Blume.\n\nMax starts to walk away. Mr. Blume calls after him.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nShe's my Rushmore, Max.\n\nMAX\n\n(without stopping)\n\nYeah, I know. She was mine, too.\n\nMax leaves the cemetery. Mr. Blume stands alone. He goes over to the tree and taps it.

FISCHER\n\nIt's been nice having your company here at the shop, Max.\n\nMax nods.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nHave you put anymore thought into giving school another shot?\n\nMax shakes his head. Mr. Fischer puts on a hunting cap with earflaps and a down parka. He zips it up. Pause.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nMax, I like being a barber. I'm good at it and I enjoy it. But I always thought you'd try a different line of work.\n\nMAX\n\nLike what?\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nI don't know. You talked about being a diplomat. Or a senator.\n\nMAX\n\nPipe dreams Dad. Nothing but pipe dreams. I'm a barber's son.\n\nMax turns on the radio and goes back into washing the combs and scissors. Mr. Fischer sighs. He puts on his gloves.

How are you?\n\nMAX\n\n(desolate)\n\nFine, thanks.\n\nMax starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. Max is caught a little offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek.\n\nMRS. GUGGENHEIM\n\nThese are glorious. Let me put them in some water. Sit down.\n\nShe takes the flowers and points to a chair beside the bed. Max sits down and stares at Dr. Guggenheim while Mrs. Guggenheim puts the violets in a vase.\n\nMAX\n\nShould I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim? Or can he not hear anything?\n\nMRS. GUGGENHEIM\n\nOh, no.

Then I hear -\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI never dumped you because we were never going out.\n\nMAX\n\nBut it doesn't make any sense. I -\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, I am confused, too. But why don't we just deal with getting you -\n\nMAX\n\nBecause it would help me if you would talk to me for a minute. And tell me what happened.\n\nSilence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nOK.\n\n(pause)\n\nWell. A. He's a married man.\n\nAnd B. He hates himself.\n\nI mean. He smashed your bicycle, didn't he?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nMy previous bicycle. Yes.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, what kind of person does something like that?\n\nMAX\n\nI don't know.\n\n(pause)\n\nWar does funny things to men.\n\nSilence. Miss Cross sits down in a rocking chair beside the bed. She opens the bottle of hydrogen peroxide.\n\nMAX\n\nHe thinks you dumped him because of Edward Appleby.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nMAX\n\nI don't know. I mean. You live in this room.\n\nMax looks around the room. There are trophies and ribbons, a chemistry set, a poster from the Olympics, three large fish tanks, a picture of Jacques Cousteau, and some model planes in dogfights hanging from the ceiling.\n\nMAX\n\nWith all his stuff. It's kind of --\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI was married to him.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nI know you were.\n\nSilence.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nAlthough I will say Edward has more spark and character and imagination in one fingernail than Herman Blume has in his entire body.\n\nMAX\n\nOne dead fingernail.\n\nMiss Cross fixes Max with a hard stare.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nRight. One dead fingernail.\n\nSilence.\n\nMAX\n\nHow'd he die?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHe drowned.\n\n(pause)\n\nHow'd your mother die?\n\nMAX\n\nShe got cancer.\n\nMiss Cross nods. She sighs.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLie still for a minute, OK?\n\nMAX\n\nOK.\n\nMiss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with a cotton ball. She stops.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nIs this fake blood?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nYes, it is.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're little children. Let me show you to the door.\n\nMax gets up and goes over to the window. He climbs out onto the roof. He looks back to Miss Cross.\n\nMAX\n\nThat wasn't a very satisfying conversation.\n\nMiss Cross shrugs. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nAll right. Goodbye, Miss Cross.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nGoodbye, Max.\n\nMax disappears into the darkness.\n\nEXT. FROZEN POND. DAY\n\nA few ICE SKATERS race around and do figure-8's on the little frozen pond at the edge of town. Dirk is sitting on his tackle box, fishing from a hole in the ice. He stomps his feet, and even with his mittens on he has to blow into his hands to keep warm.\n\nMax sits with his bare hands resting on the ice.\n\nMAX\n\nPeople hate me.\n\nDIRK\n\nThat's not true.\n\nMAX\n\nGuggenheim tried to spit on me.\n\nPoor old guy couldn't even spit.\n\nAnd Blume and Cross?\n\n(shakes his head)\n\nThey can't stand me.\n\nI ruined their whole relationship.\n\nDirk looks down at Max's red hands.\n\nDIRK\n\nYou should put your mittens on.\n\nMAX\n\n(absently)\n\nOh. They're already numb. I'm surprised you don't spit on me, Dirk.\n\nDIRK\n\nYou're my friend, Max.\n\nTear's starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm sorry about what I said about your mother giving me a hand job. I just --\n\nDIRK\n\nI know, Max. Listen. I'm sorry I didn't take your hand when Buchan kicked your ass.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nI got a few licks in. At the very least, he'll think twice about spreading that kind of garbage.\n\nDIRK\n\nYou should stand up.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm awfully comfortable.\n\nSilence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt right in front of them.\n\nThe skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half of her face. She says to Max:\n\nSKATER\n\nIs this your handwriting?\n\nShe holds out a little piece of paper torn out from a spiral notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written on it in blue crayon.\n\nINSERT PIECE OF PAPER:\n\nPlease come to the frozen pond at 3:30 PM this afternoon. Thank you very much.\n\nMax looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook.\n\nMAX\n\nNo. But it looks familiar.\n\nMax gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang.\n\nMAX\n\nDo you know Dirk Calloway?\n\nMARGARET\n\nI don't think so.\n\nMAX\n\nDirk, this is Margaret Yang.\n\nDirk nods. Margaret waves to him. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nI heard about your science fair project on Action 13 the other day. They said the Navy was going to buy it from you.\n\nMargaret is polite but cold.\n\nMARGARET\n\nNot anymore.\n\nMAX\n\nWhy not?\n\nMARGARET\n\nBecause it was fake.\n\nMAX\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMARGARET\n\n(sighs)\n\nI faked all the results.\n\nMAX\n\nWhy?\n\nMARGARET\n\nBecause it didn't work. I thought it would but it didn't.\n\nMAX\n\n(in disbelief)\n\nYou mean it was all bullshit?\n\nMARGARET\n\nNot all of it. Just the parts I didn't get right.\n\nMax stares at her. It is as if he is seeing her for the first time. He says quietly:\n\nMAX\n\nThat's exactly the way I would have handled that situation.\n\nMARGARET\n\nWell. It's nothing to be proud of.\n\nMAX\n\nBut it's true.\n\nMax is completely hypnotized by her.\n\nMARGARET\n\nYou were a real jerk to me.\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nI know. I'm sorry, Margaret.\n\nSilence.\n\nMARGARET\n\nWell. Anyway. Nice to see you.\n\nMAX\n\nYeah. Nice to see you, too.\n\nMargaret starts skating slowly away backwards. Max waves to her. She spins and skates off full-speed. Max watches her go. Silence.\n\nMAX\n\nYou set me up.\n\nDirk nods. Max says wistfully:\n\nMAX\n\nNot bad, not bad. The child has become the father of the man.\n\nMax looks out across the frozen pond. He pulls off his ski cap and feels the cold air against his cheeks. Snowflakes catch in his eyelashes.\n\nMAX\n\nWe might have to get some hockey skates, Dirk.\n\nDIRK\n\nI already got you some.\n\nDirk reaches into his backpack and takes out a pair of skates. He hands them to Max. Max looks at them for a minute. He nods slowly. Something begins to change in his face. He says with quiet intensity:\n\nMAX\n\nDo me a favor, will you?\n\nDIRK\n\nSure. What?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nPack up your goddamn tackle box.\n\nDirk smiles. Max grabs Dirk's fig pole and starts walking. Dirk calls after him:\n\nDIRK\n\nYou sure you don't want to stay here and feel sorry for yourself?\n\nMAX\n\nI'll take a rain check.\n\nDirk grabs his tackle box and follows Max briskly off the ice.\n\nEXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY\n\nMr. Blume stands on the sidewalk in front of the barbershop. He stares off into the distance. He has his hands in his pockets and his hair is blowing in the wind.\n\nMr. Fischer is inside reading the sports page.\n\nA cab pulls up and splashes water on Mr. Blume, but he does not appear to notice. Max gets out of the cab. He is dressed in a beautiful green velvet suit and bow tie. He smiles.\n\nMAX\n\nThanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nMax hands Mr. Blume a little white cardboard box. Mr. Blume frowns.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhat's this?\n\nMax shrugs. Mr. Blume starts to open the box. Max flinches away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens the box. There are two little pins inside.\n\nMAX\n\nThat's the Perfect Attendance awards and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore. I thought you could choose which one you like more, and you could wear that one and I could wear the other.\n\nMr. Blume's face softens. He nods slowly. He studies the pins and says quietly:\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI'll take punctuality.\n\nMAX\n\nOK.\n\nThey put their pins in their lapels.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nThank you.\n\nMax nods. He smiles.\n\nMAX\n\nCome on. Let's go inside.\n\nMax motions to the barbershop. Mr. Blume looks confused.\n\nINT. BARBERSHOP. DAY\n\nMr. Blume follows Max into the barbershop. Mr. Fischer looks up from his newspaper.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nWell, looks what the cat dragged in.\n\nMAX\n\nSorry, I'm late. I want you to meet somebody.\n\n(looks to Mr. Blume)\n\nMr. Blume, this is my father, Bert Fischer.\n\nSilence. Mr. Blume nods slowly.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nNice to meet you, Mr. Fischer.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\n(smiles)\n\nMr. Fischer's my father's name. Call me Bert.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(pause)\n\nOK, Bert.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nMax tells me you could use a haircut.\n\nMr. Blume hesitates.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nLet's have a look at you.\n\nMr. Blume sits down in one of the barber's chairs and looks in the mirror. Max and Mr. Fischer stand on either side of him. Mr. Blume looks terrible. He sighs deeply.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI don't know, Bert.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nDon't worry. We might have to throw in a shave, too. Max? Why don't you get Mr. Blume a cup of coffee?\n\nEXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY\n\nMax and Mr. Blume come out of the barbershop and walk quickly down the sidewalk. Mr. Blume's hair is crisply cut and neatly combed, but his clothes still look very disheveled.\n\nMAX\n\nHow much are you worth, by the way?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI don't know.\n\nMAX\n\nOver ten million?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nYeah. I guess so.\n\nMAX\n\nGood, good.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nWhy?\n\nMAX\n\nCause we're going to need all of it.\n\nDECEMBER MONTAGE:\n\nChristmas decorations are evident throughout the following scenes.\n\nMax and Mr. Blume watch a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in Mr. Blume's office. Ernie runs the projector.\n\nMax and Mr. Blume visit a marine research facility. Mr. Blume holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth.\n\nMax and Mr. Blume sprint down the street and through the park in warm-up suits. They hurdle bushes and dodge traffic. They run into an empty football stadium and race up the bleachers.\n\nMax's young architect shows Max and Mr. Blume a miniature baseball diamond field. The architect slides over the diamond an inch and puts model of a building labeled The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory in its place.\n\nMax and Dirk skate around on the frozen pond during complicated tricks and jumps.\n\nEXT. VACANT LOT. DAY\n\nA large crowd of Rushmore student, parents and faculty has gathered around the vacant lot beside the baseball field. A huge banner says The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory. There is a huge bulldozer and a cement truck at the back of the lot.\n\nMax and Mr. Blume shake hands for the yearbook photographer. Mr. Blume is holding a gold shovel with a ribbon around it.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nShe's not coming, is she?\n\nMAX\n\n(pause)\n\nIt doesn't look good.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nAh, shit, man. What the hell am I doing here?\n\nMr. Blume throws down his shovel and starts to walk off. Max yells at him:\n\nMAX\n\nDammit, Blume! How the hell did you ever get so rich? You're a quitter!\n\nMr. Blume looks at Max in shock.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nThis cost me eight million dollars!\n\nMAX\n\n(hesitates)\n\nAnd that's all you're prepared to spend?\n\nSilence.\n\nEXT. THE FISCHER'S HOUSE. DAY\n\nMax carries as old leather typewriter case in the backyard. He sets it down on a picnic table. The case has an inscription on it in gold letters.\n\nINSERT TYPEWRITER CASE:\n\nBravo, Max! Love, Mom.\n\nMax unzips the case. There is an old portable manual typewriter inside. Max rolls a piece of paper into it and starts typing furiously. He pauses to drink a sip of hot chocolate. He starts typing again.\n\nTITLE:\n\nJanuary.\n\nEXT. WEBSTER SMALLEY SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. DAY\n\nWebster Smalley is Rushmore's sister school. The doors to the lower school burst open and twenty-five first-grade girls in plaid jumpers run yelling onto the playground.\n\nMiss Cross comes out of the building after the girls. She sees Max coming down the hill in his green suit.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nI like your suit.\n\nMAX\n\nThanks.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nIs that velvet?\n\nMax nods. Miss Cross feels his lapel. It has a Perfect Attendance Award pin in it.\n\nMAX\n\nSorry you couldn't make it to our little groundbreaking the other day. It's kind of a shame, since he's building it for you.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, you know, I never asked anybody to build me an aquarium. I'm not sure how that rumor got started.\n\nMAX\n\nHm. Me, neither. You think Edward Appleby would've built you one?\n\nMiss Cross thinks for a minute. She sounds surprised at her on response.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYeah. He probably would've. If he had the money.\n\nMAX\n\n(smiles)\n\nThat's what I thought. Blume's got a little more spark and vitality than you expected, doesn't he?\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nBut the aquarium was your idea.\n\nMax smiles and shrugs his shoulder.\n\nMAX\n\nWell, I gave it to my friend.\n\nMax turns and starts walking away. He looks back over his shoulder and says:\n\nMAX\n\nBy the way, I still haven't fucked anybody yet. But I guess that's just the way it goes.\n\nMiss Cross smiles sadly.\n\nINSERT TEACHER' MAILBOXES:\n\nA cabinet of little slots where teachers get their mail and memos. Someone puts a little envelope into the slot marked Rosemary Cross.\n\nINT. WAREHOUSE. DAY\n\nMax stands at the counter in a huge construction supply warehouse. A SALESMAN says:\n\nSALESMAN\n\nFifteen sticks?\n\nMAX\n\nYes, please. And make the order out to Ready Demolition, Tuscon.\n\nMax holds up a driver's license. The salesman looks at it and writes something on a clipboard. Max walks out of the warehouse with several large boxes over his shoulder. The boxes say DYNAMITE on them in large red letters.\n\nEXT. STREET. DAY\n\nDirk comes out of a hiding place in the bushes as Max walks over with the dynamite. Dirk is holding a pellet gun.\n\nMAX\n\nMake sure these don't get wet.\n\nMax hands Dirk the boxes and takes the pellet gun.\n\nMAX\n\nI'll see you at 3:15.\n\nMax starts walking away down the sidewalk.\n\nDIRK\n\nWhere you going?\n\nMAX\n\n9without stopping)\n\nRushmore. I got one last piece of unfinished business I got to attend to.\n\nEXT. RUSHMORE. DAY\n\nMax pumps his pellet gun shot about twenty times. He raises the stock to his shoulder as Magnus Buchan walks onto the quadrangle. He draws a bead on him and follows him in his sight as he passes be. He fires.\n\nMagnus screams and grabs his only good ear. He spins around and sees Max cocking a pellet gun.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nFischer! Ya fuck!\n\nMAX\n\nHello, Magnus. I'd have shot you in the other ear, but it got blown off a long time ago.\n\nMagnus starts to come at Max. Max points his weapon at him.\n\nMAX\n\nNot so fast.\n\nMagnus stops.\n\nMAX\n\nI owed you that one. Now we're even.\n\nMAGNUS\n\n(smiles crookedly)\n\nNot for long, kemosabe.\n\nMAX\n\n(shrugs)\n\nWe'll see.\n\nSilence. Max holds Magnus at gunpoint.\n\nMAX\n\nI got a proposition for you.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nShove it up your mother's arse, ya little prick.\n\nMAX\n\nI've got to hand it to you, Magnus. You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play?\n\nMAGNUS\n\n(puzzled)\n\nDon't piss with me, Fischer.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm not pissing with you.\n\n(reaching in his backpack)\n\nI brought you a script.\n\nMax hands Magnus a script with a red cover.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nWhat's all this shite?\n\nMAX\n\nNothing. I just think you're right for the part.\n\nMagnus stares at Max. He says quietly:\n\nMAGNUS\n\nI always wanted to be in one of those frickin' plays of yours.\n\nMAX\n\nI know you did, mate.\n\nMagnus looks at the script.\n\nINSERT COVER OF PLAY:\n\nHEAVEN AND HELL\n\na new play by Max Fischer\n\nrevised draft\n\nDramatists Guild registered\n\nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT\n\nThe school auditorium.\n\nWe see many familiar faces in the audience: Mr. Fischer, Dr. Guggenheim in his wheelchair, Mrs. Guggenheim, Mrs. Calloway, Mrs. Whitney, the Indian groundskeeper, the yearbook photographer, Coach Beck, Ernie, Mr. Holstead, Mr. Adams, the police who arrested Max, some old men from the barbershop. They are all dressed nicely in evening clothes.\n\nMiss Cross' friend John, whom Max humiliated at dinner after the Serpico play, is seated in the third row. He is dressed in a coat and tie.\n\nAn USHER directs Miss cross to her seat. She is surprised to see that it is right nest to Mr. Blume's. She reluctantly sits down beside him. Mr. Blume sees her.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHi, Herman.\n\nMr. Blume nods. He pulls his ticket out of his inside pocket and checks the seat number. He looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross smiles.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nLooks like Max pulled a fast one on us.\n\nMr. Blume nods.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHow's your aquarium coming along?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nNot too bad. It should be finished in October.\n\nMiss Cross nods.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nI just made a deal with a guy in Singapore for half a dozen electric eels.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nThat sounds good.\n\nThe lights go down. A spotlight appears and Max walks onstage in a tuxedo. He goes to a microphone in the middle of the stage.\n\nMAX\n\nI don't usually do this, but this play means a lot to me, and I wanted to make a dedication. So I'll just say that this play is dedicated to the memory of my mother, Eloise Fischer. And to Edward Appleby. A friend of a friend.\n\nNeither Mr. Fischer nor Miss Cross were expecting this announcement, and they are moved by it.\n\nMAX\n\nAlso you'll find a pair of safety glasses and some earplugs underneath your seats. Please feel free to use them. Thank you very much.\n\nMax exits the stage and the audience applauds. There is a moment of rustling and whispering in the dark theater.\n\nThe curtain opens on:\n\nVietnam. Napalm smolders in the sky above the jungle.\n\nDirk runs onstage dressed in a Green Beret uniform and sunglasses. He has an M-16. He yells to Max as Max shimmies down out of a palm tree:\n\nDIRK\n\nLet's rock, Esposito!\n\nMAX\n\nLock and load, Surf Boy!\n\nThere is an explosion and Max and Dirk run through the smoke. Suddenly the stage is swarmed by VC regulars. Everyone starts shooting at once.\n\nBursts of gunfire light-up the audience's faces and smoke floats over their heads as we hear the sounds of jets flying over, bombs exploding, choppers taking off, and a SOLDIER'S voice screaming into his radio:\n\nSOLDIER\n\nMayday! Mayday! Seven niner Almighty! Adjust your coordinates!\n\nSome members of the audience put on their safety glasses and earplugs. Woody stands nervously in the wings with a fire extinguisher.\n\nOne of the extras accidentally clubs Max in the temple with the butt of his rifle. Max's eyes close. He crumples to the floor. The fighting stops. The audience begins to murmur.\n\nMax opens his eyes. He sees the frightened soldiers looking down at him.\n\nHe grabs his M-16 and opens fire. The battle resumes.\n\nINSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:\n\nIntermission.\n\nThe sign is leaning on an easel in front of the curtain. Little roses and tulips are painted around its edges.\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT\n\nActors run around frantically backstage. Max has a band-aid on his forehead. He is touching-up a gory makeup effect over Dirk's eye. He turns to Woody.\n\nMAX\n\nHow much time we got, Wood?\n\nWODDY\n\n(checks his watch)\n\nTwo minutes.\n\nMAX\n\nBring me some more ketchup.\n\n(points to the band-aid on his head)\n\nAnd make this look real.\n\nEXT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT\n\nThe lobby of the auditorium is buzzing with people talking about the play and having drinks.\n\nMr. Blume is standing alone outside, smoking a cigarette. It is snowing softly. Miss Cross comes out with a cup of coffee in each hand. Mr. Blume turns around and looks at her.\n\nShe goes over to him and hands him one of the coffees.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(sadly)\n\nThank you.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHold this one, too, Herman.\n\nHe holds both coffees while Miss Cross pours some little containers of cream into then and stirs them with a plastic straw. She takes back her cup of coffee.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nSo what do you think of Max's latest opus?\n\nMr. Blume gives a thumbs up and stares out into the snow.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nLet's just hope it's got a happy ending.\n\nMiss Cross smiles. She smoothes her hand across Mr. Blume's hair. He looks into her eyes. She links arms wit him gently and they drink their coffees together.\n\nINT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT\n\nMax and Magnus Buchan, with a three-day beard and a cigar, stand together among the fallen bodies and smoldering trees.\n\nMAX\n\nI want you to have something, Sarge.\n\nMax hands Magnus Mr. Blume's silver .45 automatic.\n\nMAX\n\nI won't be needing this anymore.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nSemper fi, Esposito. Semper fi.\n\nMAX\n\nSic transit gloria, sir.\n\nMax looks out to Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume looks back at him.\n\nMAX\n\nSay a prayer for Surf Boy. Wherever he is.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nGood luck, soldier.\n\nMagnus salutes Max and walks off. We hear his voice as he goes into the wings:\n\nMAGNUS\n\nTag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD!\n\nMax throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife.\n\nBut then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell.\n\nMARGARET\n\nHello, Esposito.\n\nMax drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her.\n\nMiss Cross smiles sadly.\n\nMax looks into Margaret Yang's eyes.\n\nMAX\n\nWill you marry me, Le-Chahn?\n\nMARGARET\n\n(instantly)\n\nYou bet I will.\n\nWagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause.\n\nMrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit.\n\nThe Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically.\n\nINT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT\n\nThe gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion.\n\nDirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of the Army barracks motif.\n\nMiss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nMax sent you an invitation?\n\nJOHN\n\nYeah. And he told me to wear a tie.\n\nMax and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG.\n\nMAX\n\nThank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore.\n\nMRS. YANG\n\nWhy? Too political?\n\nMAX\n\nNo. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals.\n\nMax sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching.\n\nMAX\n\nMiss Cross, this is my father Bert Fischer. He's a barber.\n\n(to Mr. Fischer)\n\nThis is my friend Rosemary Cross.\n\nMr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nHi, Rosemary.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nNice to finally meet you, Bert.\n\nMAX\n\nAnd, of course, you know Mr. Blume. I also want everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret.\n\nMiss Cross and Margaret smile at each other.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nHello, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET\n\nHello, Miss Cross.\n\nThe Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie.\n\nCOACH BECK\n\nI'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard.\n\nERNIE\n\nWell, last year he tried to raise piranhas.\n\nCOACH BECK\n\nWhat'd you think of the play, Mr. Littlejeans?\n\nGROUNDSKEEPER\n\nBest play all year, man.\n\nMr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook photographer are having a conversation.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nWell, Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' lines.\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nReally? I didn't notice.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHER\n\nAre Ronny and Donny having a good time at military school?\n\nMR. BLUME\n\n(instantly)\n\nThey love it.\n\nMAGNUS\n\nLucky bastards.\n\nMr. Fischer is talking with John.\n\nJOHN\n\nI understand you're a neurosurgeon.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nNo. I'm a barber. But a lot of people make that mistake.\n\nMr. Fischer laughs.\n\nDirk and Dr. Guggenheim watch Max laughing and dancing with Margaret Yang. Max points to Dr. Guggenheim. Dr. Guggenheim smiles and points back to him. He says in a hoarse whisper:\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\nWho's the Chinaman with Fisher?\n\nDIRK\n\nThat's Margaret Yang. She's actually Korean.\n\nDR. GUGGENHEIM\n\n(pleasantly surprised)\n\nI know the Koreans. They're good people.\n\nMax and Margaret are talking as they dance:\n\nMAX\n\nYou were incredible tonight, Margaret. You were that poor girl.\n\nMARGARET\n\nThank you. I loved it when you grabbed onto the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.\n\nMAX\n\nThat was totally improvised.\n\nMargaret nods. They look at each other smiling.\n\nMAX\n\nCan I ask you a question?\n\nMARGARET\n\nOf course.\n\nMAX\n\nCan you do an Australian accent?\n\nMargaret looks puzzled. Max smiles.\n\nMAX\n\nI'm working on something that's set in the outback.\n\nMr. Fischer is sitting at a table having a glass of champagne with Max's math teacher, Mrs. Whitney. She has a slight English accent. Mr. Fischer wears a sky blue blazer.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nThat's a beautiful dress, by the way.\n\nMRS. WHITNEY\n\nWhy, thank you, Bert. That sportscoat is rather smashing in its own right.\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\nI know it's a little loud. But I feel like celebrating.\n\nMRS. WHITNEY\n\nWould you care to dance?\n\nMR. FISCHER\n\n(surprised)\n\nI'd love to.\n\nMr. Blume brings Miss Cross a glass of champagne as Max and Margaret dance by.\n\nMARGARET\n\nHello, Mr. Blume!\n\nMR. BLUME\n\nHi, Margaret!\n\n(to Max)\n\nMay I cut in? I haven't had a change to cut a rug with your new girlfriend yet.\n\nMAX\n\n(embarrassed)\n\nNew girlfriend.\n\nMARGARET\n\nYes, I am. And find your own partner, Mr. Blume. No offense, but I'm spoken for.\n\nMAX\n\nNo, it's OK. He's my friend.\n\nMargaret and Mr. Blume dance off together. Max and Miss Cross are left alone.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nWell, you pulled it off.\n\nMAX\n\n(shrugs)\n\nIt went OK. At least nobody got hurt.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nExcept for you.\n\nMAX\n\n(smiles sadly)\n\nNah. I didn't get hurt that bad.\n\nMax looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross sips her champagne. She looks back at Max for a minute. She smiles. Mr. Fischer calls out to them as he dances by with Mrs. Whitney:\n\nMR. FISHCER\n\nCome on, you two! Shake a leg!\n\nThey wave to Mr. Fischer. Miss Cross looks to Max.\n\nMISS CROSS\n\nYou want to dance?\n\nMAX\n\nCertainly. But let's see if we can get the DJ to play something with a lithe ---\n\nMax snaps his fingers. He turns to the DJ and yells:\n\nMAX\n\nRueben!\n\nThe DJ looks to Max. Max makes a little gesture that seems to say, This is the one. The DJ nods.\n\nThe music cuts off in the middle of the song. Everyone stops dancing. They look around wondering what's going on.\n\nA new song starts up. It is the saddest song of the night.\n\nMax looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross puts out her hand. Max takes it and walks with her onto the dance floor, into the crowd, as everyone slowly begins to dance. \n\n\n\nRushmore\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Wes Anderson\u00a0\u00a0Owen Wilson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:28.838031"}
