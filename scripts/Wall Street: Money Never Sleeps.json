In 1973 he went out on\r\n           his own to establish a spectacular\r\n           career as a independent trader then an\r\n           active participant in the LBO craze of\r\n           the 1980s.\r\n\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           In 1988, he was indicted for insider\r\n           trading and then charged with other\r\n           various forms of securities fraud and\r\n           IRS violations. In one of the most\r\n           harshest sentences ever given to a\r\n           white collar criminal... he served\r\n           fourteen years in a maximum security\r\n           prison and he wants me to stress that\r\n           it was not a country club.\r\n          Again laughter from the floor.\r\n\r\n                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)\r\n           Since his release in 2002, he has\r\n           written and has spoken publicly about\r\n           what he refers to as the current state\r\n           of the world economy. He is not\r\n           allowed to trade on the US exchanges.\r\n           His new book \"Moral Hazard!

I don't think people get\r\n           it. And I know the financial center\r\n           of the world doesn't get it... which\r\n           happens to be Washington DC now.\r\n          As he takes to a pace...\r\n\r\n           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)\r\n           To understand where we are, we need to\r\n           understand how we got here. No good\r\n           deed goes unpunished, all fires start\r\n           with a well meaning spark and we\r\n           wanted Americans to be able to afford\r\n           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try\r\n           to get the middle and lower classes\r\n           into homes they can own. So we made\r\n           money cheap and lowered restrictions\r\n           on mortgage lending.\r\n          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...\r\n\r\n           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)\r\n           Somebody reminded me the other night\r\n           that I once said \"greed is good.\" I\r\n           swear I don't remember it but it\r\n           sounds like something I would say in\r\n           the Eighties.\r\n\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           And I was right then. Greed was good.\r\n           America needed greed and risk-taking\r\n           and leverage to get to become the\r\n           superpower we are... or were. And\r\n           capitalism needed greed and risk and\r\n           leverage to become the economic\r\n           platform it has become... but those\r\n           same attributes that got us there are\r\n           now the liabilities that threaten to\r\n           destroy us.\r\n          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it.
