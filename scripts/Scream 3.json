He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have \npaid attention to Christine he might have known this.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t VOICE\n\t\t\tCome on. Don't you know?\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t BEN\n\t\t\t\t  (hesitating)\n\t\t\tIt's CICI! Cici's the name of the character \n\t\t\tshe plays in the movie!\n\n\t\t\t\t VOICE\n\t\t\tVery good. Now we play ROUND 2. \n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tWhat?! But I did everything you said to do!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tThat's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're \n\t\t\ttaking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me \n\t\t\tbeneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. \n\t\t\tI'll have your girlfriend.

You listen to me, if you're not where I want\n\t\t\tyou in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.\n\t\t\tDo you understand? \n\nIN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.\n\nThe killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV \ninto gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car \nscreeches down the off ramp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n\nBen comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. \nSparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the \nawaiting b.g.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT\n\nThe SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps \nout of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing \nahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into \nhis SUV, gets an idea.\n\nTHE BACK --\n\n--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not \ngonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE \nSLUGGER with \"ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER\" written across it. \n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t   (to himself)\n\t\t\tThank God I decided to do some community service.\n\nBen takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards \nthe sign when suddenly --\n\nHIS CELL RINGS.\n\nBen answers the call.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t  (into phone)\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tVery good. You follow directions well.\n\t\t\tNow for the final part of the game.\n\t\t\tPut down the bat and approach the sign,\n\t\t\tslowly.\n\nBen makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the \nsign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t  (into phone)\n\t\t\tWhere are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tCloser than you think.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t  (into phone)\n\t\t\tAlright I'm here. What the fuck do you want\n\t\t\tfrom me?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tTo see your reaction.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tReaction to what?\n\nBen passes under the huge, pallid \"H\" in the sign. What seems at first like a \ngentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs \nturning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tOHMYGOD! NO!\n\t\t\tCHRISTINE --\n\nHas been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in \nthe \"H\" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the \nSouthern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, \nnot seeing --\n\nTHE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal \nstab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, \nface to face with his attacker.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t  (screaming)\n\t\t\tBUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHE GHOST\n\t\t\tYou just lost the role Ben.\n\t\t\tConsider this your parting gift.\n\nAND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, \ncausing a vicious eruption of crimson.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tTITLE CARD.   \"SCREAM 3\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPEN ON:\n\n\tEXT.

And today\n\t\t\tofficially starts the Summer movie\n\t\t\tseason.

Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea \nof white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.\n\n\t\t\t\t GALE\n\t\t\tWell I see a lot of the audience has dressed\n\t\t\tto the occasion. Today we have director of the\n\t\t\tupcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman\n\t\t\tBridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice\n\t\t\twelcome to the set of Total Entertainment.\n\t\nThe crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, \nravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy \nwhite suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee \nmug beside Gale's hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tGood morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tIt's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\t   (addressing audience)\n\t\t\tWell it's a honor to be here amongst so\n\t\t\tmany fans of the genre. And I must say\n\t\t\tthat any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,\n\t\t\tor Tori or David not returning to complete\n\t\t\tthe STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is\n\t\t\there. Aided with my excellent cast of\n\t\t\tnewcomers I believe we're going to pull\n\t\t\toff one of the best Stabs yet.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tRoman, from your enthusiasm it certainly\n\t\t\tseems that way.\n\t\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\t\tHonestly though, \n\t\t\t\t(smiles) \n\t\t\ttell us, what's\tyour favorite scary movie?\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\t  (a long pause)\n\t\t\tHonestly, my life.\n\nA eclectic hush falls over the crowd.

The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into \napplause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second \nrate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of \nthe set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her \nimagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as \nif the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.\n\nA LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign \nhanging over the stage. THE WORD \"COMMERCIAL BREAK\" is illuminated in flashing \nred light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to \nRoman.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tWould you excuse me for a moment?\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\t  (smiling)\n\t\t\tSure.\n\nGale bolts for --\n\nINT.

Any way, the \n\t\t\tsecond one, Christine Perkins, she had a part \n\t\t\tin Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE KINCAID\n\t\t\tBoth of them were found brutally murdered this \n\t\t\tmorning under the Hollywood sign.

STAB 3 SET - DAY\n\nA huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane \nhanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes.

In \nother regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the \nWoodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.\n\nDEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --\n\nTOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy \nof Dewey at best.

She won her part in STAB 3 \nplaying Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark \nhair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.\n\nAnd also the loveable\n\nTYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.\n\nThe three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the \nproduction.\n\n\t\t\t\t SARAH\n\t\t\tGoddamnit I am getting so fed up with\n\t\t\tthese re-writes.

She's decked out in the flashy neon \ngreen ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on \nher right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't \nreally want to be in her company very long.\n\n\t\t\t\tGale\n\t\t\tShit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJennifer\n\t\t\tListen, I know we've never met, and \n\t\t\tI don't mind you never returning my calls, \n\t\t\tbut I have to tell you that after two films \n\t\t\tI feel like I am in your mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tGale\n\t\t\tWell, that would explain my constant headaches.  \n\n\t\t\t\tJennifer\n\t\t\t  (defensively)\n\t\t\tYou know I'm sorry that things didn't work out \n\t\t\ton '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' \n\t\t\tthat's a pretty good fall back.\n\n\t\t\t\tGale\n\t\t\tThank you.

Listen I gotta get back to \n\t\t\ttrying to get hold of Sid.\n\t\t\tBesides, she's more important than you ever were.\n\n\t\t\t\tGale\n\t\t\tWait! Dewey we can work on this together!\n\t\t\tAs a team!

Kincaid enters frame, \ttalking to two \nproducers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man \nwith gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy \nfifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, \nignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their \nconversation.\n\n\t\t\t\tMILTON\n\t\t\tI can assure you that security on the set\n\t\t\twill be at an all time high. Again, the\n\t\t\tdeaths are sheer tragedy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE KINCAID\n\t\t\tWell, I'd hate to see the production shut down.\n\t\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\t\tI myself am a big STAB fan.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t\tReally?\n\t\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\t\tHave you ever thought about acting?\n\t\t\tYou've got just the right face.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE KINCAID\n\t\t\tI am kind of dedicated to my job.\n\t\t\tAlthough I do enjoy taking acting\n \t\t\tclasses on my weekends.

Why the hostility?\n\n\t\t\t\tMILTON\n\t\t\tListen Lois Lane, I love your show and \n\t\t\tall but last month I happened to catch \n\t\t\tyour little segment on me and how my wife \n\t\t\tleft me because I'm a sex addict who \n\t\t\tenjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. \n\t\t\tIt was a real eye opener my lawyers are \n\t\t\tstill thinking about bringing to your \n\t\t\tsuperior's attentions.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\t  (shit-eating smile on her face)\n\t\t\tThey're the ones who approved it.\n\nMilton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at \nKincaid.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tAlright Kincaid, no where to?\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE KINCAID\n\t\t\tI go to the police station and do my job,\n\t\t\tand you go back to being Gale Weathers.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tOh.

Lying in a pool of blood at his feet \nis ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --\n\n  THE GHOST --\n\n\t\t\t\tTOM\n\t\t\tYou fucker!\n\n The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The \nghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to \nlift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom \ngags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  \ntrickle of blood down his lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOM\n\t\t\t  (gagging)\n\t\t\tFucker!\n\nTHE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the \ncloset. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST \nsteps back, admiring his work.\n\n  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nJennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\tShit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\t I don't know.

Dewey looks at the \nfront door.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tSsh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.\n\t\t\tI'll get it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\tWhat if it's the killer?\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tOh use your brain drama queen!\n\t\t\tDo the killers ever knock on the fucking door? \n\t\t\tEver see Jason do that before burying an axe in \n\t\t\tsome big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or \n\t\t\tChucky? Huh?\n\nJennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked \naway under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tDon't worry. I'm prepared for anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tAmen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!\n\nDewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer \nhuddle together, follow close behind.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\tDo you smell something?\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\t  (smirking)\n\t\t\tIt's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.\n\nGale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. \nDewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, \nturns it when suddenly --\n\nTHE POWER SIZZLES OUT!\n\nEVERYONE SCREAMS!\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tAlright don't panic! Just a fuse.\n\nDewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A \nSYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tHurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!\n\nDewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading \noutside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tWho's phone?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\tOh shit it's my cell!\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tAnswer it!\n\nJennifer answers her cellular.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t  (into phone)\n\t\t\tHello?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tHello Jennifer.

Jennifer \nscreams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up \nhis gun, fires.\n\nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs\nIn the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey \nbacks into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\tGod damn it you two! Run! Hurry!\n\t\t\tHe's dead!\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tNo! He's not dead! He's still breathing!\n\t\t\tLook!\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tGale he's dead. Come on.

Dewey winds back, \nkicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through \nthe chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the \nhardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --\n\nJENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\t\tDIE MOTHER FUCKER!\n\t\t\tDIE! DIE! DIE!\n\nJennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her. \nHelps her up.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tCome on!\n\nTHE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a \ntrail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell \nJennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame \ntrail lunges towards the two women. They scream.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tOH SHIT! RUN!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nJennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! \nTHE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.\n\nA HUGE CONFLAGRATION!

Maybe there is a \n\t\t\tthird killer.  Sidney Might know something \n\nKincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tI told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  \n\t\t\tAnd even if there was a third killer, \n\t\t\tSidney doesn't know about it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE KINCAID\n\t\t\tThat is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,\n\t\t\tshe is a key element in this case.

TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY\n\nSidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, \ncramped trailer watching the tape. \n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\t Oh MY god.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDY\n\t\t\tWell, if you're watching this tape, it means \n\t\t\tas I feared, I did not survive these killings \n\t\t\there at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason \n\t\t\tI am here is to help you, so that my death \n\t\t\twill not be in vain.  That my life's work, will \n\t\t\thelp save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  \n\t\t\tIf this killer does come back, and he's for real, \n\t\t\tthere are a few things that you gotta remember.  \n\t\t\tIs this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same \n\t\t\trules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you \n\t\t\tfind yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, \n\t\t\tand a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel \n\t\t\trules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing \n\t\t\twith a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding \n\t\t\tchapter of a trilogy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tA trilogy?\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDY\n\t\t\tThat's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, \n\t\t\tbut it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned \n\t\t\twith, because true trilogies are all about going back \n\t\t\tto the beginning and discovering something that wasn't \n\t\t\ttrue from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed \n\t\t\tsomething that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So \n\t\t\tif it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some \n\t\t\tsuper trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be \n\t\t\tsuper human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him \n\t\t\twon't work, basically in the third one, you gotta \n\t\t\tcryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him \n\t\t\tup.   Number two; anyone including the main character can \n\t\t\tdie.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final \n\t\t\tchapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the \n\t\t\ttime this thing is through.  Number three; the past \n\t\t\twill come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you \n\t\t\tthink you know about the past, forget it.  The past is \n\t\t\tnot at rest, any sins you think were committed in \n\t\t\tthe past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER \n\t\t\tFOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off \n\t\t\tby yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us \n\t\t\tanything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, \n\t\t\tyou're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your \n\t\t\tback. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, \n\t\t\tand for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules \n\t\t\tsay, some of you ain't gonna make it.

There's not gonna be another film. \n\t\t\tWell, at least not for you.\n\n\nTHE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, \nJohn's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. \nA pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--\n\nTHE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.\n\nTHE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.\n\n CUT TO:\n\nINT.

The lock's smashed off.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tShit. That's gonna leave a mark.\n\nGale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder.

Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST \njams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops \nto the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream.

HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT\n\nGale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of \nthem locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the \"down\" button.  The door opens \nwith a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --\n\nMILTON --\n\n--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to \ngullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. \n\nGALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.\n\nHER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.\n\nGALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, \ngiving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale \nraces out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked \n\"stairs\".

The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, \nslashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the \nhood of his car, dead.\n\nGALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife \nmenacingly.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tI wouldn't run if I were you Gale.\n\t\t\tIt's only gonna end up with you getting\n\t\t\tSkewered like a fucking pig.

Sidney's deathly quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN \n\t\t\t Roman Bridger, director. And brother.\n\t\t\t  (a beat)\n\t\t\tShe slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was \n\t\t\tRina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, \n\t\t\twhat a good idea! So I watched her, made a little \n\t\t\thome movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, \n\t\t\tmom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one \n\t\t\tthing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, \n\t\t\tthat was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing \n\t\t\this daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And \n\t\t\tonce I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was \n\t\t\ta few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case \n\t\t\tyou get caught, find someone to frame, it was like \n\t\t\ther was making a movie.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tAll the nightmares. All the hell I went through \n\t\t\twas because of you, you spineless bastard!\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tI'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, \n\t\t\tAngelina over there,\n\t\t\t  (Angelina smiles)\n\t\t\tShe's my partner. I can convince her to do \n\t\t\tanything.  We've been dating since I met her in \n\t\t\tWoodsboro.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\t  (dryly)\n\t\t\tOh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?\n\n\t\t\t\tANGELINA\n\t\t\tThat's me Sid. I always idolized you. You\n\t\t\twere always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. \n\t\t\tI wanted to make you proud.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tAnd I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of\n\t\t\ta turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every\n\t\t\ttime I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\t   (repulsed)\n\t\t\tListen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit \n\t\t\tbefore! So lets get on with it!\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tWait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.\n\t\t\tYou haven't seen the best part.\n\t\t\t  (pulls out tape recorder)\n\t\t\tWith the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've \n\t\t\tbeen able to steal your voice.\n\t\t\t  (presses play)\n\t\t\tAin't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna \n\t\t\tfind next to your lifeless, mutilated body.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\t   (off tape recorder)\n\t\t\tI can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation\n\t\t\tof the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to \n\t\t\tmake you all repent for your sins, and now\n\t\t\tI'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.\n\nSid squirms.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\t   (clicking off tape recorder)\n\t\t\tAwesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that \n\t\t\tJohn Milton, was my daddy?\n\t\t\tYep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.\n\t\t\t His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!\n\t\t\tThat's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.\n\t\t\tMommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone\n\t\t\tin this world. What a good reason to --\n\t\t\tSTAB MYSELF!\n\nRoman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's \narms.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tSee Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,\n\t\t\tthey laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,\n\t\t\tthey also set the stage for you! Introducing\n\t\t\tto the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the\n\t\t\tsurvivor! Sidney the star!\n\nRoman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. \nBleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\tSee Sid, now comes the part where we get away\n\t\t\twith it! The part where we win! Cause face it\n\t\t\tSidney, in this world, the bad guys win!\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tRoman knock it off! Do you people even know why you\n\t\t\tkill people? You kill people cause you choose to and\n\t\t\tnot because of any other fucking reason!\n\n\t\t\t\tANGELINA\n\t\t\t  (screaming)\n\t\t\tRoman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's\n\t\t\tfreaking me out!\n\n\t\t\t\tROMAN\n\t\t\t   (screaming)\n\t\t\tGod damn it Sidney!\n\nRoman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls \nherself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. \n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\t  (coughing)\n\t\t\tHey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain \n\t\t\tGale Weathers.\n\nGale pops off the handcuffs.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\t  (leaping up)\n\t\t\tI know all the tricks!\n\nGale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has \na chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.\n\nMEANWHILE --\n\nROMAN,\n\n--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. \nHe's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE \ncontinues.\n\nGALE AND ANGELINA,\n\nContinue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood \nfloor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, \nbegins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the \nknife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.\n\nSIDNEY--\n\nComes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.\n\nSUDDENLY,\n\nWHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. \nHe buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. \nSidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --\n\nIT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his \nwounds.\n\nDewey and Sid embrace.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tDewey my God I thought you were dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\t Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.\n\nSCREAMING O.S.  \n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tDEWEY! IT'S GALE!\n\nSidney and Dewey race into --\n\nLIVING ROOM --\n\nGale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.\n\n\t\t\t\t GALE\n\t\t\t  (screaming)\n\t\t\tTHIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!\n\t\t\tBITCH!\n\nGale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. \nAngelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high \nvoltage.\n\nSID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and \nDewey embrace tightly.\n\nANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.\n\nSIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.\n\n--FOYER --\n\nTHE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tWatch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always \n\t\t\tsuperhuman.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tHe wasn't superhuman Dewey.\n\t\t\tHe wasn't superhuman at all.\n\nTHEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.\n\nANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried \nmess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, \nhitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and \nbrain matter onto the wall behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\tWHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!\n\nSid turns to Roman's lifeless body.\n\nPOV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\t  (pissed)\n\t\t\tThis shit is really getting repetitive,\n\t\t\tyou know?\n\nSID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT \nSHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.\n\nSid drops the gun, walks off set.\n\n   CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING\n\nThe police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.\n\nDewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.\n\nINT.  AMBULANCE \n\nGale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEWEY\n\t\t\tGale, I know this is a bad time and all but what \n\t\t\tif we try it out again.\n\t\t\tThe whole relationship thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tGALE\n\t\t\t  (smiles)\n\t\t\tSure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.\n\nDewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.\n\n CUT TO:\n\nWALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WALLACE\n\t\t\tJesus Christ what happened?\n\t\t\tI leave for two seconds to take my\n\t\t\tkid to the doctor, I come back and it's\n\t\t\tthe fucking WILD BUNCH.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tIt was just something that's been itching \n\t\t\tto be completed for the past four years.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WALLACE\n\t\t\tI guess so.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY\n\t\t\tTake care Detective. Give my regards\n\t\t\tto the wife and kids.\n\nWallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun \nrising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we \ncrane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD.
