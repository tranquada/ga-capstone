The\n            music morphs into an OMINOUS SCORE. \n\n            With a thunderous BOOM, comes a TITLE CARD reading \"HANUKKAH\n            PAST.\"\n\n            EXT. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY\n\n            We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE\n            down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy\n            standing nervously at the foot of the statue.\n\n            Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase \"HANUKKAH IS\n            4 HOMOS\" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax\n            lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got\n            quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age.\n\n            We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school.\n            Superimposed over the picture are the words, \"ST. PETER,\n            PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.\" \n\n            Mordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school.\n\n            EXT. SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR\n            GENTILE CHILDREN.\n\n                                GENTILE BOY 1\n                      Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny.\n\n            He drops a penny. The other children cackle.\n\n            The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels.\n\n                                GENTILE GIRL 1\n                      Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel?\n\n            Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking.\n\n                                GENTILE BOY 2\n                      Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us.\n\n            More laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We\n            PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically \n            dressed child as she turns to face the camera.\n\n                                GENTILE GIRL 2\n                      Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your\n                      people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as\n                      your lord and savior you're all going to\n                      burn in hell.\n\n            Dead silence. The other children exchange \"Now that went a\n            little over the line\" looks.\n\n            The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty\n            gathers himself, and walks off.\n\n            INT. CLASSROOM - LATER\n\n            As Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear\n            a tinny version of the song Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel. \n\n            He tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL. He\n            looks at his gift, and then looks off-screen. We PAN with his\n            look to reveal...\n\n            A group of Christian children congregating around a large,\n            garishly decorated Christmas tree. A very Vegas Merry\n            Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of\n            the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children\n            festively slap high fives as they open their presents.\n\n            We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his\n            brand new ATC motorbike.\n\n            We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an \"I\n            Love Jesus\" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow\n            affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face.\n\n            We cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic\n            excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears. \n\n            Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC.  \n\n                                GENTILE BOY 1\n                      Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai got.\n                      Nice spinning top Morty. \n\n            The other children take notice of Mordechai's gift and begin\n            to laugh. \n\n            Mordechai is crushed. MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly\n            Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and\n            appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has\n            weathered. She walks over to comfort him.\n\n                                MRS. HIGHSMITH\n                      Now, now class let's not make fun of\n                      Mordechai's spinning top. We need to all\n                      learn the importance of tolerance and\n                      understanding. Isn't that right\n                      Mordechai?\n\n                                MORDECHAI\n                      Yes Mrs. Highsmith.\n\n                                MRS. HIGHSMITH\n                      So class, in honor of Mordechai's special\n                      day, I'd like for all of us to wish Morty\n                      a heartfelt Merry... \n\n            She looks to Mordechai for confirmation on the word.\n\n                                MRS.

HIGHSMITH (CONT'D)\n                      Very good class. I hope you've all\n                      learned an important lesson today. Just\n                      because Mordechai's people are different\n                      from us...just because they might appear\n                      strange to us with their furry hats,\n                      their beady eyes, and their long\n                      sideburns...not to mention their bizarre\n                      customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny\n                      sounding names...just because they\n                      control all of the worlds' money, yet are\n                      too cheap to buy their children anything\n                      better than spinning tops for presents,\n                      does not mean that we can't learn to\n                      respect and love them as our equals.\n\n            She squeezes his cheek.\n\n                                MRS. HIGHSMITH (CONT'D)\n                      Happy Chanoo-juah-kah Day 7 Morty.\n\n            A reaction shot of the mortified Morty.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            EXT. GHETTO STREET - NIGHT\n\n            A sullen Mordechai wanders the streets. Absurd XMAS\n            DECORATIONS, horrific in their appearance blanket the street. \n\n            Morty glances a GROTESQUE FAUX REINDEER with fangs. We hear a\n            growling noise as it lights up. He walks quickly away in fear\n            past... \n\n            A STOREFRONT\n\n            We track with Morty as he passes a storefront window. Inside,\n            the CLERK turns a sign outwards reading, \"JEWS NOT WELCOME.\"\n            We continue with Morty as he passes by a second storefront. A\n            similar sign reading, \"KYKES GO HOME\" is turned outwards by\n            ANOTHER CLERK. He continues past yet another building as a\n            sign reading, \"MONOTHEISTS NEED NOT APPLY\" is displayed by a\n            THIRD CLERK for Morty's benefit.\n\n            Morty looks across the street.\n\n            A sign hangs from a storefront reading \"JEWS OK FOR ABOUT 5\n            MINUTES.\" The FOURTH CLERK gives him the thumbs up.\n\n            Morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and\n            pulls out his dreidel. \n\n            He spins it, and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats\n            as Morty stares at in wonderment. \n\n            Suddenly, a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame\n            and smashes the little dreidel. Mordechai slowly looks up. \n\n            A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger, and exits frame\n            as we hear him sadistically laugh O.S. the words \"Ho, ho, ho\"\n            at Morty.\n\n            We start CLOSE on Mordechai. Rage fills every inch of his\n            face. As we SLOWLY CRANE AWAY, the opening CREDITS begin as\n            the HEBREW HAMMER THEME SONG kicks into full gear.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            TITLE SEQUENCE\n\n            As the Jewxploitation music pumps, metallic slashes rip\n            through the screen line by line, spinning into place to form\n            a Star Of David. The title, \"The Hebrew Hammer\" SLAMS into\n            frame.\n\n            TITLE CARD: HANUKKAH PRESENT\n\n            EXT. THE CHOOD - DAY\n\n            We start CLOSE on a gift wrapped Hanukkah present. We pull\n            back a bit as MORDECHAI JEFFERSON CARVER (29), AKA THE HEBREW\n            HAMMER, a baaad Jewish brother spins the package in his hands\n            as he saunters down the street past a latke stand. He's a\n            Semitic super stud straight out of a 70's Blaxploitation\n            flick. He tosses the gift to MACCABEE, a young Hasidic boy. \n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.\n\n            Macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift -\n            a Hebrew Hammer action figure. He beams.\n\n            We cut back to the Hammer as he smiles back. From O.C., we\n            hear Maccabee say...\n\n                                MACCABEE (O.C.)\n                      Thanks Hammer!\n\n            The Hammer smiles back and walks off frame.\n\n            ANOTHER PART OF THE CHOOD\n\n            We begin on the Hammer's black boots and slowly TILT up as we\n            DOLLY back with him.\n\n            The Hammer passes a line of THREE JEWISH PRINCESSES who swoon\n            as he passes. \n\n            He stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads, \"100%\n            KOSHER MEAT.\" We PUSH into his CLOSE UP as he blows them all\n            a kiss.\n\n            The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony.\n\n            The Hammer winks back.\n\n            An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second\n            story flat. \n\n                                OLD WOMAN\n                      Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for\n                      Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now.\n                      God willing, you should settle down and\n                      marry.\n\n            We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer\n            takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl\n            wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair\n            oversized librarian's glasses.\n\n            The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but\n                      right now G dash d's the only one for me. \n\n                                OLD WOMAN\n                      I can dig it.\n\n            The Hammer continues on down the street. The old woman and\n            Miriam are framed in the BG.\n\n                                OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)\n                      Hammer, you're the baaddest Hebe this\n                      side of Tel Aviv.\n\n            The Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                          (To himself)\n                      Shabat Shalom!\n\n             He walks off frame.\n\n            EXT. GHETTO ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke\n            belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid.\n\n                                SHLOMO\n                      Give it back!

He looks up, and we cut to his...  \n\n            POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn\n            big and pissed off from this angle.\n\n            The Teenage Gentile  begins to shake and stammer.\n\n                                TEENAGE GENTILE (CONT'D)\n                      We...we were going to give it back.

He's wearing a yarmulke.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      So, what's shakin' Yenta.\n\n                                TIKVA\n                      Well, for stahters, your mother called.\n                      She said to remind you that you're having\n                      Shabat Dinner by her tomorrow, and also\n                      to remind you to bring the Manischewitz,\n                      and she wanted me to relate the following\n                      information to you. \n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Okay, what's the information?\n\n                                TIKVA\n                      She said to remind you that you're having\n                      Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to\n                      remind you to bring the Manischewitz.\n\n            The Hammer lets this sink in. \n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Anything else?\n\n                                TIKVA\n                      Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office\n                      from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a\n                      terrible yeast infection and I need to\n                      see my gynecologist.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      But we're not open on Sundays.\n\n                                TIKVA\n                      I understand that. I just thought that\n                      you might want to know.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                          (Beat)\n                      I'll be in my office.\n\n            The Hammer walks into his private office and shuts the\n            frosted glass door. We hold on what's stenciled on the\n            outside of the door. The lettering reads, \"Mordechai\n            Jefferson Carver - Certified Circumcised Dick - State of New\n            York.\"\n\n                                                   YET TBD TRANSITION TO:\n\n            EXT. NORTH POLE - DAY\n\n            An establishing shot of Santa's Workshop. The lettering\n            \"NORTH POLE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP\" is superimposed over the\n            picture.\n\n            INT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (O.S.)\n                      I want to start by thanking all of you\n                      for pulling yourselves away from the\n                      workshop to make this emergency meeting.\n                      I know it's the busiest time of the year\n                      for all of you, so I'll try and be brief.\n\n            As Santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and\n            frightened looking Santa Claus. His eyes look fearfully to\n            his right.  Below the picture frame is a plaque reading \"St.\n            Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941\", we continue a slow DOLLY to the\n            right on to the next picture.\n\n            We see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his\n            appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of\n            Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, \"St.\n            Nick The Nasty 1941-1970.\"\n\n            We continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a\n            painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the\n            plaque reads, \"St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present.\"\n\n            We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice\n            Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of\n            ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their\n            nameplates hang from their necks - \"BLITZEN\" and \"RUDOLPH.\"\n\n            At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAMIAN,\n            quite a nasty looking man. \n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      My father, often referred to as St. Nick\n                      The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was\n                      obsessed with making Christmas the only\n                      holiday anyone could celebrate before the\n                      New Year.\n                      Since his death, I've prided myself on\n                      ensuring that the Christmas season is one\n                      of tolerance and understanding between\n                      all races and religions. It's always been\n                      my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa\n                      deserve the same respect as Christmas. \n\n            Damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side, and then\n            makes the JERKING OFF motion with his hand. \n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      Lights please.\n\n            As Rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room. Santa\n            picks up a remote in his hand, and turns on a SLIDE\n            PROJECTOR.\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      Over the course of my career as Santa\n                      Claus, I've made it my mission to ensure\n                      that Jews, Christians, and African\n                      Americans could all observe their\n                      respective holidays in harmony.\n\n            We see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER, an African American man\n            (Mohammed), and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner in a\n            mall reading \"HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\"\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      I was responsible for pushing the Happy\n                      Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry\n                      Christmas signage was replaced by the\n                      Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase\n                      'Happy Holidays.'\n\n            We see another slide in which an assembly of SCHOOLCHILDREN\n            are singing.\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      It was nearly a decade ago, in\n                      conjunction with our friends in the\n                      Jewish and African American communities \n                      that I supported a bill that mandated\n                      that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm\n                      dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught\n                      and sung in elementary schools along with\n                      the Christmas standards 'Frosty The\n                      Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.' \n                      Which is why upon examination of my\n                      annual naughty and nice list it shocked\n                      me to discover that my own son, Damian...\n\n            Damian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to\n            light, looks up in response to his name.\n            A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front\n            of him. We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on\n            the slide projection screen behind him.\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      The heir to the Red Suit could be so\n                      filled with hate. \n\n            Santa addresses Damian.\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n                      Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous\n                      scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first\n                      reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm\n                      only filled with sadness and\n                      disappointment. Disappointed that I\n                      failed to teach you the true meaning of\n                      Christmas. What do you have to say for\n                      yourself?\n\n            We being a SLOW PUSH into Damian as he ponders the question.\n            The cigarette dangles from his lips. \n\n            Rudolph nods to Blitzen. Blitzen returns the gesture with a\n            nod of acknowledgment.\n\n            With a slow and measured pace Damian says...\n\n                                DAMIAN\n                      Ho. Ho. Ho.\n\n            On the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the\n            silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa\n            through the chest with their antlers. Damian cringes.\n\n            Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath\n            he utters the words...\n\n                                SANTA CLAUS\n                      Et tu, Blitzen?\n\n            Santa falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him\n            with bloodied antlers is Blitzen. \n\n            Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his\n            bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. From\n            this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be referred\n            to as SANTA.\n\n            The elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at\n            their new master in horror.\n\n                                SANTA \n                      What are you fucking midgets looking at!?\n                      Get back to work!

THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY\n\n            A building resembling the Pentagon with the exception that\n            it's shaped like the Star Of David. Superimposed over the\n            picture are the words, \"JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE.\"\n\n            INT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY\n\n            A smoky chamber reminiscent of the Senate or the United\n            Nations. A GIANT BANNER reading \"HANUKKAH NOW!,\" illustrated\n            with a Hasid in silhouette with his fist raised, covers the\n            back wall behind the men.\n\n            As with the Senate House Committee, various factions of the\n            JDL sit behind plaques describing the group they represent.\n            We see members from: The Anti-Defamation League, Jews Against\n            Drunk Driving, etc. A chair belonging to THE COALITION OF\n            JEWISH ATHLETES is empty.\n\n            The floor is chaotic. The JDL Chief bangs his gavel and\n            yells...\n\n                                CHIEF\n                      Gentleman! \n\n            His pleas for silence are ignored.\n\n                                CHIEF (CONT'D)\n                      Gentleman!

We predict\n                      that the St. Nick Day Massacre will put\n                      Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at\n                      least a hundred years. With this\n                      meshuggena new Santa Claus in power,\n                      Hanukkah is in jeopardy.

A complicated and\n            charismatic package of the following qualities rolled into\n            human female form: intense, judgmental, overbearing,\n            manipulative, lacking boundaries, yet fiercely involved,\n            loving, and protective of her children. Got it?\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      Mordechai!

And you also brought a nice\n                      girl to come eat by us.\n\n            Mrs. Carver forcefully grabs Esther into an embrace\n            resembling a bear hug, and begins to plaster her with sloppy\n            kisses. Esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the\n            kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long.\n\n            Mrs. Carver places her tongue into Esther's ear canal as a\n            sign of affection, forcing Esther to break the embrace. Mrs.\n            Carver and Esther look at one another strangely for an\n            awkward few moments.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      So.

CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      Mordechai!?\n                          (Beat)\n                      So, Esther, how did you and Mordechai\n                      meet. You know they call him the Hebrew\n                      Hammer for a reason.\n\n            Esther coughs up some of her food. The Hammer interjects.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent\n                      her to try and recruit me back to save\n                      Hanukkah for them. What she doesn't seem\n                      to understand is that nothing, not even\n                      god himself could convince me to ever\n                      work for them again.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      But Hanukkah's in dan...\n\n            The Hammer cuts her off.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Not my problem. If you'll excuse me now,\n                      I need to use the bathroom.\n\n            He stands and leaves.\n\n            Mrs. Carver stares lovingly at Esther.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      You like my Mordechai, yes?\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      He's...he's very nice. \t\n                          (Desperately)\n                      But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah\n                      rests solely in his hands. Please, you\n                      have to help me.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one\n                      of the high holidays. What concerns me\n                      more is that my boychick is almost\n                      thirty, and has yet to settle down with a\n                      nice Jewish girl. \n                          (Beat)\n                      I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with\n                      your little Hanukkah problem if you help\n                      me with my Mordechai. \n\n                                ESTHER\n                          (Confused)\n                      What do you want me to do?\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      He works too much. God forbid he should\n                      have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him\n                      once in a while. Take his mind off his\n                      work. Maybe a blowjob here and there. \n\n            Esther begins to choke again.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      Is this something you could do for me?\n\n            The Hammer calls out from the bathroom.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mom, where do you keep the plunger?\n\n                                MRS.

CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      So, do we have a deal?\n\n            In the BG, we hear the toilet FLUSH. The Hammer begins his\n            walk back to the table.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Deal.\n\n            The Hammer sits down.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      So, what did you two ladies discuss while\n                      I was gone.\n\n            Esther begins to speak, but Mrs. Carver interrupts.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      I was just telling your nice friend\n                      Esther about how I used to have such a\n                      problem with the gas.\n                          (To Esther)\n                      So, once I started taking two charcoal\n                      pills before I ate, the gas cleared\n                      itself right up. \n\n            Esther plays along.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Thanks. That's...good to know.\n\n            Mrs. Carver turns her attention towards her son.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      Mordechai.

I do good things\n                      for this community. I help people.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      When I play bridge with all the girls,\n                      everyone has what to talk about with\n                      their sons. They show pictures. Their\n                      sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis.\n                      Why can't I show a picture?  \n\n                                HAMMER\n                          (Angered)\n                      So don't show a picture.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the\n                      investment banker? He paid for her entire\n                      retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he\n                      is. Instead of schleping to save\n                      Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back\n                      to business school and get an MBA. Maybe\n                      then you could send me to Boca, too.\n\n            This puts the Hammer into a neurotic fit.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Oh. Oh, What. So, all of a sudden my\n                      saving Hanukkah's not good enough for\n                      you? Is that what your saying?\n\n            Mrs. Carver throws her arms up in resignation.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      I don't want to argue with you. Let's\n                      just eat in peace.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know\n                      what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just\n                      to spite you. And when my face is all\n                      over the television. When your friends\n                      are opening their Hanukkah gifts next\n                      year, don't mention it to them, okay? I\n                      wouldn't want you to have to show my\n                      picture.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER\n                      Do what you must. \n\n            Mrs. Carver looks at Esther and winks.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                          (To Esther)\n                      Such a good boy he is.\n\n            The Hammer shakes his head in frustration.\n\n            Mrs. Carver becomes very animated.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      Mazel Tov!\n\n            MAZEL TOV, a tabby with two paralyzed back legs wearing a\n            diaper slides itself across the floor. With each writhing\n            motion we hear a very distinct SWISHING NOISE. \n\n            Mrs. Carver picks the cat up and places it in her lap. Mazel\n            Tov makes a strange, UNHAPPY NOISE. \n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                      What's that Mazel Tov? Your diaper needs\n                      changing?\n\n            Mrs. Carver pulls off Mazel Tov's diaper while it still sits\n            in her lap. She plays with undiapered cat's two good paws.\n\n                                MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)\n                          (To Mazel Tov)\n                      Let's let your tuchus breathe.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mom, why don't you put that cat out of\n                      its misery?\n\n                                MRS.

No.\n                      Mazel Tov will lead a full life just like\n                      the rest of us. Isn't that right Mazel\n                      Tov?\n\n            The cat purrs back at her. She takes the cat from her lap and\n            places it on the floor.\n\n            BROWN STREAKS cover her white blouse.\n\n                                MRS.

JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE FRONT GATE - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The exterior resembles any walled private residence with a\n            front gate. The Hammer stands in front of the large, metallic\n            Star Of David vault-like gate and pushes the button next to\n            it. A COMPUTERIZED VOICE begins...\n\n                                COMPUTERIZED VOICE\n                      Jew Confirmation Test initiated.\n\n            He's clearly irritated by this.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      You've gotta be kidding me.

The gate shuts behind him, and he finds\n            himself in an all white room. A microphone is placed by\n            another massive door directly in front of him. \n\n                                COMPUTERIZED VOICE\n                      Please state the six dishes found on the\n                      Passover Seder plate in alphabetical\n                      order?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas,\n                      Maror, and Zeroa.\n\n            The second door slides open, and Morty steps forward into the\n            next room. Inside this room lies a single violin in a case.\n\n                                COMPUTERIZED VOICE\n                      Please demonstrate musical aptitude.\n\n            The Hammer picks up the violin and begins to play 'Hava\n            Nagila.' He's pretty damn good at it. The next door slides\n            open, and Hammer steps forward into yet another room.\n\n            A drape, about four feet high off the floor, is stretched\n            into a semi-circle against the wall of the room. \n\n                                COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D)\n                      Please step forward and remove your\n                      undergarments.\n\n            The Hammer steps inside the drape, and drops his pants.\n\n            A panel on the wall opens, and a metal probe heads for his\n            shmekel. He is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of\n            testing.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Oooh.

The room is completely\n            empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front\n            wall by the door.\n\n                                COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D)\n                      Final test initiated.\n\n            Nothing happens. The Hammer waits a few seconds, but quickly\n            becomes agitated.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Hello? Can anybody hear me?

The Chief observes\n            the Hammer as he continues to whine. Next to them, a METER\n            with the label \"WHINING SCALE\" slowly grows in magnitude as\n            the Hammer continues to rant. The meter bars go from red to\n            yellow in color.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      I am so unhappy with this situation.

Before I left, I was packin' up my\n                      shit and I overheard the nigga talkin' to\n                      some business pahtnah or something. Sayin\n                      that he'd meet him today at some joint\n                      called Duke's. Round five o'clock if my\n                      memory serves. When he got off the phone\n                      and jetted, I scoped the room for some\n                      jewelry, cash, whatevers. You know, a\n                      severance package. Didn't find any\n                      duckets, but I did snatch this.\n\n            Jamal pulls out a matchbbok from his pocket. The front cover\n            reads, \"DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN.\" He hands it to the\n            Hammer.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Thanks little brother, you've been a big\n                      help.\n\n                                JAMAL\n                      Shit fool, ain't no thang.

We hear\n            the sounds of bursting flames. \n\n            The Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past\n            the camera.\n\n            We pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the\n            shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn.\n\n                                                          FADE TO BLACK.\n\n            PUSHERMAN MONTAGE\n\n            Curtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a\n            STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys\n            in an a alley.

The Hammer looks out his left\n            window. TWO Hasidic CHILDREN decorate a giant Christmas tree\n            on the street. \n\n            He looks to his right. A GROUP of HASIDIC kids sing Christmas\n            Carols.\n\n            The Hammer looks through his front windshield. A kid is\n            standing right in the middle of the road! \n\n            The Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just\n            inches from the kid. It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer\n            helped with the Yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange\n            glazed look in his eyes. Shlomo holds a videocassette in his\n            hand.\n\n            The Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open.\n            We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Shlomo, you okay?\n\n                                SHLOMO\n                          (Dreamily)\n                      Mommy says that every time you hear the\n                      sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets\n                      his wings!\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Huh.\n\n            The car door beeps again.

You see Esther, the\n                      trick to undercover work is to try and\n                      blend in. Act as a Gentile would.\n\n            The two pass a samples booth. The FREE SAMPLES WOMAN solicits\n            the Hammer.  \n\n                                SAMPLES WOMAN\n                      Could I interest you in a free sample\n                      bacon cheeseburger? \n\n            We get a CU of the burger followed by a CU of the Hammer.\n            He's mortified, but he pulls it together.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      While I thank you, Gentile friend, for\n                      your generous offer of that deliciously\n                      unkosher snack, I sadly have to decline\n                      for I stuffed myself full of meat and\n                      milk product at a prior lunch engagement.\n\n            The Sample Woman looks at him strangely as the Hammer and\n            Esther walk on.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      You're good.\n\n            The two take their place at the end of the line in to see\n            Santa.\n\n            Tony performs the two fingered whistle.\n\n                                TONY\n                      Can I have everyone's attention please.\n                      In fifteen minutes, Santa's gonna have to\n                      leave.\n\n            The kids all vocalize their disappointment.\n\n                                TONY (CONT'D)\n                      Ah, don't be like that kids. We gotta lot\n                      work to do if we're gonna get all those\n                      presents out in time.\n\n            The kids aren't buying it. More boos and protests of\n            disapproval.\n\n                                TONY (CONT'D)\n                      Hey! Hey! You want shitty ass presents\n                      for Christmas? You want Barbies with\n                      heads screwed on backwards? You want\n                      remote control cars without the batteries\n                      included. Then be my fucking guest!\n\n            Tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to\n            take his place in front of the velvet ropes.\n\n            Esther surveys their place in line. It's about fifteen deep.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      What are we going to do? We're at least\n                      an hour from the front.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      C'mon follow me.\n\n            The two make their way up to the front of the line. They pass\n            a man who looks eerily like ex-rapping god, MC HAMMER.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                          (To Hammer)\n                      Is that...? No, couldn't be.\n\n                                TONY\n                      Hey, hey! Not so fast.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      We have to get through. It's an\n                      emergency.\n\n                                TONY\n                      Sorry pal, you're gonna have to wait in\n                      line just like all the other parents.\n\n            Esther adjusts her bust. She's incredibly sexy in her tight\n            fitting denim jacket. She smiles flirtatiously at the Elves.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      We're so sorry to have to cut, but our\n                      beautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us\n                      in line.\n\n            She puts her hand on Tony's bicep and smiles once again.\n\n                                ESTHER (CONT'D)\n                      It would mean so much to Paul and I if\n                      you'd let us through to see Santa.\n\n            Tony is putty in her hands.\n\n                                TONY\n                      Well...umm, when you put it that way.\n                      Sure go on through.\n\n            Tony unhinges the rope, and the two pass. The Hammer leans\n            over to Esther.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      You're good!\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            INSIDE THE CURTAIN\n\n            JIMMY, an adorable six year old sits on Santa's lap. Santa's\n            assistants, two busty blondes named BAMBI and TAWNI, flank\n            his chair. \n\n                                SANTA\n                      And what do the Jewish people do during\n                      Hanukkah?\n\n                                JIMMY\n                      They worship the devil and sacrifice\n                      small Gentile children like me in\n                      bizarre, sadistic rituals.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      That's right. Santa can tell that you've\n                      been a very good boy this year. Run along\n                      now Jimmy.\n\n            Bambi and Tawni escort Jimmy out, and re-enter with Esther\n            and the Hammer. Santa's confused.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Sorry folks, I don't do couples.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      If you keep your mouth shut and come with\n                      me, you won't get hurt.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a\n                      look around you. Do you even know who I\n                      am?\n\n            The Hammer rips off his baseball hat and T-shirt. Santa\n            gasps.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Let me guess, you're the goy who stole\n                      Hanukkah.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.\n\n            The Hammer takes out his gun and points it Santa.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What's your shpiel, Santa? \n\n                                SANTA\n                      Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is\n                      this any way to treat an old family\n                      friend? Let's cut out all the\n                      unpleasantness. I admit, I went way\n                      overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing.\n                      Let me make it up to you. How about a\n                      peace offering?\n                          (To Bambi and Tawni)\n                      Girls.\n\n            Santa snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themselves\n            on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Bambi. Tawni. I'd like for you to meet\n                      world renown Semitic super stud,\n                      Mordechai Jefferson Carver. \n\n            Bambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl.\n\n                                BAMBI\n                      Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men.\n                      They're so sensitive and well read.\n\n            Esther is clearly jealous.\n\n            The Hammer's enjoying the attention. He looks down at Bambi's\n            breasts. We're talking HUGE, obviously augmented boobolas. A\n            large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in\n            between the mounds of silicone. We hear the requisite DING as\n            it sparkles.\n\n            The Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the Gentile\n            Seductress.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Sorry Santa. I like my women like my\n                      matzah. Unleavened. \n\n            The girls move away from the Hammer. Esther smiles at the\n            Hammer's resolve.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      This is where you go down.\n\n            Suddenly, Tony draws the curtain back.\n\n                                TONY\n                      Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch\n                      of kids...\n\n            He sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santa's head.\n\n                                TONY (CONT'D)\n                      Oh shit!\n\n            Esther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Back it up buddy!\n\n            He does. The entire crowd of children can now see what's\n            happening. Hushed, fearful whispers. MC Hammer steps out of\n            line and pleads...\n\n                                MC HAMMER\n                      Please Hammer, don't hurt em'!\n\n            The Hammer does a double take. MC Hammer gives a \"Did I just\n            say that?\" expression.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Let's do this clean. I don't want to make\n                      a scene Santa.\n\n            Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Well, it's a bit too late for that now,\n                      isn't it? Excuse me children, if I could\n                      have your attention for a moment.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What are you doing?\n\n                                SANTA\n                      I'm just calming the kiddies. \n                          (To children)\n                      There's no need to worry about Santa.\n                      He's just having a peaceful, adult\n                      conversation with his nice Jewish friend,\n                      The Hebrew Hammer.\n\n            The Hammer plays along, raising his hand to keep the children\n            calm.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?\n\n                                SANTA\n                      In fact, he's just informed me that he\n                      personally plans on cancelling Christmas\n                      this year. \n\n            The Hammer and Esther look to one another. This riles the\n            masses. Trouble.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Why don't we show him how that makes us\n                      feel.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            AN EMPTY SECTION OF THE MALL - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            We hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked\n            portion of the mall. \n\n            Suddenly, Esther and the Hammer haul ass around the corner,\n            running for their lives.\n\n            A second or two pass, and an ANGRY MOB of about twenty\n            Gentile children round the corner after them. They're\n            definitely not in the Christmas spirit.\n\n            The Hammer and Esther take another turn. From the other\n            direction a SECOND MOB OF CHILDREN head straight at them. \n\n            The Hammer spots another corridor in front of them.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      C'mon!\n\n            They run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall. A dead\n            end! O.S. we can hear the throng of children nearing in the\n            BG.\n\n                                THRONG (O.S.)\n                      Where'd they go? I saw them go down that\n                      hallway. C'mon, let's get em'!\n\n            Hammer turns to Esther defeated.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      It's over. We're doomed.\n\n            The barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the \n            Biblical slave song, \"Let My People Go\" sounds as if it's\n            coming from within the walls of the mall. \n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Shh. Shh, listen. Do you hear that?\n\n            The Hammer tries to place the source.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What is that? \n\n            Suddenly, a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door.\n            The other side of the door is dark, but it has a cavernous\n            feel to it.\n\n            An elderly Jewish woman, HARRIET TUBBELMAN, appears from out\n            of the doorway. She smokes a corncob pipe.\n\n                                HARRIET TUBBELMAN\n                      Psst. Hammer, Esther. This way. Hurry! \n\n            Harriet escorts the two into the passageway, and the door\n            slides shut behind them.\n\n            INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an\n            'It's A Small World After All' type water ride. \n\n            Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the waiting\n            cars. The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket theme\n            going on. The 'Let My People Go' song, piped from unseen\n            speakers, is now at full strength.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      You saved our lives. Thank you. How can I\n                      ever repay you...?\n\n                                HARRIET TUBBELMAN\n                      ...My name is Harriet Tubbelman, but you\n                      can call me Moses. The only payment I ask\n                      Mordechai, is that you keep Hanukkah safe\n                      for us all.\n\n            She hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap\n            restraints for Hammer and Esther, testing them to make sure\n            they're secure.\n\n                                HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D)\n                      You should be safe from here on out. Just\n                      follow the river to it's conclusion.\n\n            She begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she\n            turns back to face them.\n\n                                HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D)\n                      Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs\n                      inside the water craft at all times.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Where are we? What is this place?\n\n            She smiles with great pride.\n\n                                HARRIET TUBBELMAN\n                      Welcome to the Underground Jewish\n                      Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy\n                      the ride.\n\n            The brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it\n            way from the loading dock.\n\n            Wide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings.\n\n            Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of\n            Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet\n            oddly entertaining way. \n\n            The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check\n            out the attraction in wonderment. \n\n            Esther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear\n            she's falling for him. \n\n            We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down\n            the river. A funkdafied version of the \"Let My People Go\"\n            song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride.\n\n            EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n            We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two\n            turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear\n            the muffled sounds of the gospel version of \"Let My People\n            Go.\" Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, \"HANUKKAH\n            NOW!\"\n\n            The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out\n            into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door,\n            and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley. \n\n                                HAMMER\n                      That got annoying fairly quickly.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Yeah, no kidding.\n\n            A CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground\n            Jewish Railroad' booth. \n\n                                CARNIVAL WORKER\n                      Tickets please.\n\n            The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets.\n\n                                CARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D)\n                      Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish\n                      Railroad. If you plan on returning today,\n                      please make sure to get you hands stamped\n                      before you leave the alley.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though.\n\n            The two walk past him. Esther turns to the Hammer.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      So, now what?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Now we wait for Santa to make his next\n                      move.\n\n            He gives her a once over. She is stunning.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      Want to get a drink?\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Sure. Why not.\n\n            EXT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - DAY\n\n            Your typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the\n            Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large\n            menorah shaped sign out front.\n\n            INT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS\n\n            We see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the\n            men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room,\n            stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly\n            demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections.\n\n            Onstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be\n            determined 70's funk classic.\n\n            Esther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the\n            BANDLEADER notices the two walk in...\n\n                                BANDLEADER\n                      Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody!\n\n            The Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. The entire bar\n            cheers and applauds.\n\n            Hammer escorts Esther to a table on the woman's side of the\n            wall, and then walks around to the other side of the divider\n            where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her.\n\n            The band begins a rousing version of \"Hava Nagila.\" A good\n            majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and\n            begin dancing zealously with one another.\n\n            Esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din\n            of the bar.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      So, do you come here often!?\n\n            The Hammer struggles to hear. He shouts back to her.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What was that!?\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      I said, do you come here often!?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Oh. Yeah, about once a week!\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      What!?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      I said, yeah, about once a week!\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Oh!\n\n            A HASIDIC BAR PATRON approaches the Hammer and smiles.\n\n                                HASIDIC BAR PATRON\n                      Would you like to dance?\n\n            We get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm, \n            on the dance floor.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      I'm okay right now. Thanks though.\n\n            As the Patron leaves, JOSHUA, another Hasidic man standing\n            directly behind him takes his place at the Hammer's table.\n\n                                JOSHUA\n                      Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Nah, I'm good. I'm kind of here with\n                      somebody.\n\n            The Hammer motions to the wall. Joshua looks as if his\n            feelings are hurt.\n\n                                JOSHUA\n                      Oh. Okay. Maybe next time.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it\n                      easy.\n\n            As Joshua leaves, we get a WIDER shot of the Hammer's table.\n            A LONG LINE OF MEN leads up to it.\n\n            CHAIM FEYGELE, an effeminate slick Hasidic man, chest hair\n            spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt,\n            neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the Hammer. He's\n            got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face. \n\n                                CHAIM FEYGELE\n                      Well Shalom there mister!\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Do we know each other?\n\n                                CHAIM FEYGELE\n                      No, but we have mutual friends.\n\n            Chaim points to the dance floor. Another shot of men dancing\n            with one another, arm in arm.\n\n                                CHAIM FEYGELE (CONT'D)\n                      The name's Feygele. Chaim Feygele.\n\n            This guy is clearly making the Hammer nervous.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mordechai. My friends call me Morty.\n\n                                CHAIM FEYGELE\n                      So Morty, I just love a man in a black\n                      suit. Care to dance.\n\n            Mordechai is flustered.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Uhhh. You know, I...have to go to the\n                      bathroom. I'll be right back.\n\n            The Hammer gets up quickly and leaves.\n\n            We cut to Esther's side of the wall. The Hammer walks behind\n            her while she checks out the band on stage.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      Hey there.\n\n            She turns around, pleasantly surprised.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Hey.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Do you want to get out of here? \n\n            She looks relieved.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      I would love to get out of here.\n\n            INT. THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT\n\n            A smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the\n            speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT\n            of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts\n            and moans a bit. \n\n            We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling\n            back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The\n            Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes,\n            forcing her into awkward positions, etc. \n\n            We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes\n            yet again.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Ouch!\n\n            Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Sorry. I'm better with men.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                          (Sensually)\n                      Maybe we should try a different kind of\n                      dancing.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      You mean like disco dancing or doing the\n                      funky chicke...Oh. I get it.\n\n            We see a TIGHT MEDIUM SHOT of Esther. Her erect nipples are\n            clearly outlined through her blouse. Now, the Hammer's really\n            getting it.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      Now we're talking Boobola.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Mordechai?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Yes Esther.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      I want you to talk dirty to me.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Oh. Okay.\n\n            He thinks for a moment.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      I want to have lots of children by you.\n                      Get a good paying, stable job. Settle\n                      down in Long Island somewhere. Someplace\n                      nice. Fancy. But not fancy schmancy. \n\n            She's warming up. \n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      I want for our children to go to private\n                      schools and take music lessons. Little\n                      Abraham will go to Stanford for college,\n                      Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Keep going.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Afterwards they'll make the decision as\n                      to whether or not they'd like to continue\n                      their religious studies in Israel.\n                      Because, hey, after all we'll have\n                      practiced the highly effective assertive\n                      democratic style of child rearing,\n                      sprinkled with a healthy dose of\n                      liberalism.\n\n            She's on fire for him.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Oh god, yes!

I feel something poking around down\n                      there. Maybe I should investigate. What\n                      do you think about that Mr. Certified\n                      Circumcised Dick?\n\n            She begins to unzip his pants. We cut to a shot of an excited\n            Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants\n            reach its conclusion. \n\n            A CU on her as she looks down at his Jewish Manhood. A wide\n            eyed, almost shocked reaction. She slowly looks back to him\n            and smiles slyly.\n\n                                ESTHER (CONT'D)\n                      Shabat Shalom!\n\n            As the two embrace, we RACK FOCUS from the two of them in the\n            BG to the Hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in\n            the FG.

And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires.\n\n            The camera makes it way up to reveal a large ROADSIDE\n            BILLBOARD ARROW, resembling the ones you might see\n            advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces \"THE\n            JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK. 20 Kilometers.\" \n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            EXT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - AFTERNOON\n\n            From the outside the J.A.C has the appearance of an\n            observatory. For no apparent reason, a small MOTORCYCLE RAMP\n            sits near the front door. \n\n            A single Fed-Y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot.\n\n            A gang of THUG ELVES spill out of the back of the truck as a\n            S.W.A.T. team would. \n\n                                HEAD ELF\n                      Go, go, go!\n\n            The Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            An ELF FLUNKY stand by a SMALL MOTORCYCLE RAMP, studying it\n            curiously.

I think it was left over from\n                      an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television\n                      special. You want me to get rid of it? \n\n                                HEAD ELF\n                      No time. Besides, it's not like someone's\n                      gonna jump their motorcycle into the\n                      building while we're inside.\n\n            The HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky.\n\n                                HEAD ELF (CONT'D)\n                      There's Santa now.\n\n            The Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an OVERHEAD PUSH\n            DOWN ON THEM as helicopter force winds blow their hats off. \n\n            The carriage of SANTA'S SLEIGH touches down on the ground. \n\n            Tiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits\n            violently over the other side. Santa finishes up, and wipes\n            his mouth with his hand.\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      You okay?\n\n                                SANTA\n                      No. I'm airsick you asshole!

Why don't you ask them sir.\n\n            Santa takes this in.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            Santa paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of\n            harnessed reindeer. They're shivering in their hooves.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Who's the leader of this operation?\n\n            More scared reindeer faces. Comet furtively motions towards\n            Rudolph with his antlers. Santa sees this, marches quickly up\n            to Rudolph, and gets in his face.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      What's your major malfunction, dumbfuck!?\n\n            Rudolph's scared shitless.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Step forward son!\n\n            Rudolph attempts to move forward, but the harness attachments\n            prevent him from doing so.\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      Uh, he can't sir. The harnesses.\n\n            You can feel the Robert Deniro-esque intensity boiling inside\n            of Santa.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      You gonna learn to guide this sled right?\n                      You gonna make sure your men follow suit?\n                      Because if I'm puking down chimneys come\n                      Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have your hide.\n                      We clear?\n\n            Rudolph shakes his head. The bells on his harness tinkle.\n\n            Santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away.\n            Rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at\n            Santa as he makes his way out of frame. The expression on\n            Rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily\n            follows the O.S. Santa.\n\n            Suddenly, Santa charges right back into frame, and places his\n            drawn gun to Rudolph's temple.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      You eyeballin' me son!?\n\n            Rudolph quickly looks away. Santa puts his gun back into his\n            belt, and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his\n            composure.\n\n            Without warning, Santa throws a fake punch at Rudolph's face,\n            forcing the reindeer to flinch.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      I didn't think so.\n\n            INT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Santa and his gang bust through the front doors, taking the\n            TWO GUARDS by surprise. \n\n            Santa's men quickly tie them up and duct tape their mouths\n            shut as if out of 'Gulliver's travels.' The guards are\n            dragged away out of frame.\n\n            Santa steps towards camera and surveys the room.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      The Jewish Atomic Clock.\n\n            It's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an\n            observatory would be housed. The clock is breathtaking in its\n            size. On its face, in place of the standard numerals are the\n            names of Jewish holidays. For example, \"Yom Kipur\" is where\n            the twelve should be, followed by \"Passover\", etc. In the\n            center of the face, an odometer-like gauge reveals the year\n            '5734.' At its base, the brilliant blue Judeum glows\n            brightly. \n\n            Santa barks out orders.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Get moving! We've got work to do!\n\n            One of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the song\n            'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' begins to play.\n\n            A few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the Judeum\n            clock base and begin pumping.\n\n            EXT. ISRAELI HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n            The Hammer is moments away from the J.A.C. compound. He spots\n            the motorcycle ramp, and then guns his engine. He's close!\n\n            INT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Inside, Santa and his thugs hear the sound of the Chopper\n            growing in strength. The ROAR of the engines is piercingly\n            loud! And then nothing.\n\n            A beat passes, and then the Hammer's motorcycle busts open\n            the front door. \n\n            An INSERT of the Hammer's bike skidding to a stop. \n\n            As Santa goes for his gun, the Hammer interrupts him...\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Uh. Can you just give me one second?\n\n            Santa is confused.\n\n            Still on the bike, the Hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the\n            motorcycle to the doorway. Looks of bewilderment from Santa\n            and his gang.\n\n            The Hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand. A John\n            Wooish SLO-MO shot as the Hammer touches his hand to the\n            mezuzah nailed to the doorframe. \n\n            The Hammer jumps off the bike, and we get the requisite QUICK\n            push in on him as he pulls out two Uzi's from under his\n            jacket.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      Let's dance the hora!\n\n            Santa draws a pistol, and with a single shot from his Uzi,\n            the Hammer blows it out of his hand. \n\n            It lands on the other side of the room. Santa looks up from\n            his empty hand.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Get him boys!\n\n            Santa's Elf Thugs open a CHEST filled with LARGE SUB-MACHINE\n            GUNS. The chest is labeled \"HEAVY ARTILLERY.\" With great\n            difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of\n            the box. \n\n            The Hammer, mildly amused, watches them.\n\n            The Hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety.\n            The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant.\n\n            An Elf sneaks quietly towards Santa's gun.\n\n            Esther walks in through the front door and spots something\n            O.S. that gives her cause for concern.\n\n            Unbeknownst to the Hammer, the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santa's\n            gun.  He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Mordechai! Behind you!\n\n            The Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time.\n\n            Esther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the Hammer, and\n            the two fire off rounds.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What are you doing here?\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you\n                      do this alone.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking\n                      out yesterday. I was wrong.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      I forgive you.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Go check on the clock. I'll finish up\n                      here.\n\n            We do another QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he turns towards\n            Tiny Tim.\n\n            Tiny Tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his\n            arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights.\n\n            The Hammer grins mischievously.\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      Uh oh.\n\n            The Hammer begins firing.\n\n            In SLOW-MOTION, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an\n            overturned table, gunfire trailing him.\n            Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his\n            crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the\n            table.\n\n            He lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath the\n            table.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Get off of me you cripple!\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      What are we gonna do? He's got us on the\n                      ropes.\n\n            We DOLLY BACK with the Hammer as he approaches the camera,\n            firing rounds at the table.\n\n            We cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their chairs.\n            One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the\n            window. Fear fills both of their eyes.\n\n            We see what they see. Through the window, the SUN is quickly\n            setting behind the mountains.\n\n            We cut back to the Hammer. The speed with which he shoots\n            begins to slow.\n\n            Esther, checking the clock for damage calls to him. \n\n                                ESTHER\n                      What's the matter?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      I don't know. I'm feeling kind of tired.\n\n            We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table. We\n            HEAR the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases\n            altogether. Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      What's going on?

They look exhausted.\n\n            Tiny Tim drops back below the table.\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      Well, he's kinda just resting in the\n                      corner with his girlfriend.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Resting?\n\n            He thinks for a second.

We've got him\n                      beat.\n\n            The Hammer's POV as Santa and his thugs approach him\n            cautiously. \n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Well, well, well.

The line is pulled\n            taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe.\n\n            The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's\n            Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way\n            while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly\n            around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and\n            turns to him.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      You know, you don't have to hold on to my\n                      waist.

Indeed, he is\n            tied in.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      I knew that.\n\n            EXT. SANTA'S COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - OTHER SIDE - MOMENTS\n            LATER\n\n            The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground. The\n            Hammer looks around.\n\n            No guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked\n            \"BACK DOOR.\"\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      Well, that was easy.\n\n            Mo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Wait! Before we enter, you need to know\n                      that my research has determined that\n                      Santa's compound is wired with the XP\n                      2000 stereo type alarm system. \n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      A stereo type alarm system?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Take a look.\n\n            The Hammer points to above the door. Sure enough, there sit\n            TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      How do we bypass it?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      The alarm will trigger if the system\n                      detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies\n                      inside the building. For example, if you\n                      were to dribble a basketball, or eat\n                      watermelon, or use the word dawg...that\n                      is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the\n                      letter o...within the confines of this\n                      workshop, the alarm would sound.\n\n            This pisses Mo off.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      Listen cat, I'll have you know that I\n                      hate the taste of watermelon and am a\n                      terrible basketball player.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Well that's good news for us. It means\n                      the system is outdated. This should be\n                      easy. C'mon.\n\n            The two enter through the door. \n\n            INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The Hammer shuts the door behind them. So far, so good.\n\n            Suddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the\n            hall. They duck into a corner. \n\n            The sound of the footsteps passes. The Hammer makes the\n            silent military \"eyes\" gesture to Mo by pointing two fingers\n            at his eyes, indicating for him to check and see if the coast\n            is clear.\n\n            Mo bends out from the corner to look. Pennies fall from his\n            pockets.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      It's all clear. Let's go.\n\n            The Hammer bends down to pick up the change.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mo, I think you dropped some... \n\n            Mo's eyes widen in terror.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      Hammer, no!\n\n            The Hammer picks up the pennies, and the ear splitting alarm\n            system is triggered. Red Lights flash, and over the\n            loudspeakers we hear..\n\n                                LOUDSPEAKERS\n                      Jewdar alert! Jewdar alert!\n\n            Mo and The Hammer start running down the hallway. Doors line\n            the corridor.\n\n            The Hammer kicks open one of the doors, and enters as it\n            shuts behind him. The camera stays in the hallway with Mo,\n            who looks around nervously. From inside the room, we can hear\n            INTENSE GUNFIRE.\n\n            The Hammer exits the room.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Let's go!\n\n            The two continue on down the hall. The Hammer spots another\n            door, violently kicks it open, and enters. Again, the door\n            shuts behind him followed by the sound of more INTENSE\n            GUNFIRE. \n\n            The Hammer exits.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      C'mon, let's go!\n\n            Mo stops and looks at him.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      What are you doing?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic\n                      Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.\n\n            Mo shakes his head in understanding, and the two run on,\n            making a hard right out of frame at the corridor's end. A\n            beat passes, and then we hear MORE INTENSE GUNFIGHTING.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            ANOTHER CORRIDOR\n\n            Mo and the Hammer run into frame. Mo points to the other end\n            of the hall.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      There's Tiny Tim.\n\n            Tiny Tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in\n            the other direction.\n\n                                MOHAMMED (CONT'D)\n                      I'll take Tiny Tim. You go find your\n                      woman.\n\n            Mo runs down the hallway after Tiny Tim. The Hammer turns\n            towards the other direction to find...\n\n            TWO ELVES on multi-colored MOPEDS comin' right for him.\n\n            The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground.\n\n            Right before they reach him, the Hammer quickly pulls his\n            Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched,\n            clotheslining the two off of their mopeds. \n\n            The elves are out cold. The Hammer admires his work.\n\n            Santa, running for his life, rounds the corner. He stops dead\n            in his tracks as he spots the Hammer.\n\n            The two look at one another for a brief moment, and then\n            Santa points at something behind the Hammer.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Hey, what's that over there? Is that a\n                      bowl of Matzah Ball soup?\n\n            The Hammer looks behind him. Nothing. He turns back to find\n            Santa long gone.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Damn!\n\n            He takes off down the hall after Santa.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            ANOTHER CORRIDOR\n\n            Mo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock\n            the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side\n            with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away,\n            etc. \n\n            Realizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim\n            comes to a stop.\n\n            Mo trains his pistol on him.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      Now I'm gonna do to you what I should\n                      have done earlier.\n\n            Tiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst.\n\n            Mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs\n            off. Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down\n            against the wall. We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls to\n            Mo.\n\n                                TINY TIM\n                      My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches.\n\n            INT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Santa enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the\n            front door with anything he can find: a chair, a large\n            crucifix, a CART OF TOMATOES. Feeling confident that the door\n            is secure, he turns around to find the Hammer standing in\n            front of him.\n\n            The Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Where's my girlfriend Santa?\n\n                                SANTA\n                      I don't have to tell you anything Hammer!\n                      You're gonna have to kill me before I\n                      tell you!\n\n            The Hammer's confused.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      But if I kill you, then you'll be dead.\n\n            Santa thinks about this for a couple seconds.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Good point.\n\n            The Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign\n            taped to a door directly behind Santa. It reads, \"THE ROOM\n            WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS.\"\n\n            The Hammer grins mischievously at Santa.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Don't worry your pretty little head.\n\n            Hammer fires a single round past camera. RED SPLATTERS his\n            face.\n\n            We cut to the other side. Santa cowers by the cart of\n            TOMATOES.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      That was a warning shot.\n\n            We hear Esther screaming from inside the room.\n\n                                ESTHER (O.S.)\n                      Mordechai! I'm in here! Help! \n\n            The Hammer turns towards the sound.\n\n            Suddenly, Santa kicks the Hammer's gun out of his hand, and\n            then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at\n            him.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Looks like the tables have turned once\n                      again Hammer.\n\n            More screaming from Esther behind the door. \n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      And you won't even be able to say goodbye\n                      to your Esther. So sad. So long\n                      Mordechai. Give my father my regards.\n\n            Santa readies to fire.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Wait! I didn't want it to come to this,\n                      but you leave me no choice. I have no\n                      other option but to use the most powerful\n                      weapon in the Jewish arsenal.\n\n            The Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if\n            in meditation. Santa looks around nervously.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      What are you doing?\n\n            The Hammer meditates for a bit more. Suddenly, his eyes open\n            and he begins...\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      I shlepped all the way to the North Pole\n                      for this? I come to fight you, and you\n                      don't even put out anything to nosh on?\n                      What kind of arch nemesis are you?\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on\n                      me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.\n\n            Esther continues to scream for help. This makes the Hammer\n            even more determined.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      What sort of host would treat company\n                      this way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable\n                      in your guest room. I'm shvitizing from\n                      running around shooting people. And my\n                      feet. What kind of flooring is this\n                      anyway? My arches are killing me.\n\n            It's beginning to work on Santa.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      No. Stop it!\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      And to top it off, you didn't even have\n                      the courtesy to give me a proper hello\n                      when I entered the room. What have I ever\n                      done to you to be treated with such\n                      disrespect?\n\n            Santa's a wreck.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Please, make it stop. I'll do anything.\n                      Here take my gun.\n\n            He hands his piece to the Hammer and kneels on the ground,\n            pointing to his head.\n\n                                SANTA (CONT'D)\n                      Shoot me. Please, just one to the head.\n                      Put me out of misery.\n\n            Mo enters the room.\n\n                                MOHAMMED\n                      Hammer, you alright?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Everything's kosher. Watch him for me. \n\n            INT. ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS - MOMENTS\n            LATER\n\n            The Hammer kicks open the door.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Esther!\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Mordechai!\n\n            She is restrained to a chair. The Hammer quickly unties her,\n            and the two kiss.\n\n            As they continue kissing, we hear the sound of someone\n            CLEARING THEIR THROAT. The Hammer looks towards the source of\n            the noise to see none other than JOSEPH LIEBERMAN. Joe is\n            tied to a chair, and wears a Gore/Lieberman 2000 campaign\n            button.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Joseph Lieberman?\n\n            The Hammer begins to untie Joe.\n\n                                JOSEPH LIEBERMAN\n                      Mordechai! Thank god you're here.\n\n            Esther looks at the Hammer curiously.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      You two know each other?\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      We go to the same temple.\n\n            All three step back into Santa's Conference Room. Mo\n            continues to hold Santa at gunpoint.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      Mo, get him out of my sight.\n\n            Mo begins to take Santa away. \n\n            The Hammer turns around.\n\n                                HAMMER (CONT'D)\n                      No, wait. I need closure here.\n                          (To Santa)\n                      I just wanna say one thing. You know\n                      where you messed up Santa? You\n                      underestimated the true meaning of\n                      Hanukkah.\n\n            Santa's a broken man. He gets on his knees and inquires\n            earnestly...\n\n                                SANTA\n                      Please tell me. What is the true meaning\n                      of Hanukkah?\n\n            The Hammer thinks about this for a second. He's drawing a\n            blank. He looks to Esther, and she shrugs back at him. \n\n                                HAMMER\n                      That's...that's a very good question. And\n                      I do know that it does have something to\n                      do with...dreidels, and...\n\n            Esther chimes in.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      ...and latkes.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      And latkes! And some miracle oil that\n                      lasted eight days. And that my friend,\n                      should've been enough for you. Take him\n                      away Mo.\n\n            Mo drags Santa out of the room.\n\n                                SANTA\n                      I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was\n                      wrong. I'm...\n\n            And Santa's gone.\n\n            The Hammer turns to Esther, and gets down on one knee. He\n            places a ring on her finger.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you\n                      marry me?\n\n            She glows.\n\n                                ESTHER\n                      Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my\n                      last name to be with you.\n\n            The two kiss in celebration. \n\n            Joe pokes his head out into the Hallway.\n\n                                JOE LIEBERMAN\n                      What happened out there?\n\n            He looks to the Hammer. The Hammer shrugs his shoulders.\n\n                                JOE LIEBERMAN (CONT'D)\n                      Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest gore.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Well then maybe you should have thought\n                      about that before you ran with him.\n                      C'mon, let's get you back to Washington.\n\n            And we PULL out as the three make their way down the hallway.\n\n            TITLE CARD: ONE WEEK LATER. CHRISTMAS EVE.\n\n            INT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT\n\n            Mrs. Carver exits the kitchen, platters of food in hand.\n\n                                MRS.

Esther and Hammer gag from\n            the smell of it.\n\n            Mun Chi, a forkful of food inches from his mouth, gets a\n            whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration.\n\n                                HAMMER\n                      Mom!

To you, the cat pooping in\n                      his diaper is somehow better than my\n                      saving a Jewish holiday.\n                          (Giving up)\n                      Forget it.\n\n                                MRS.

And then,\n                      when we get back, Morty's been talking\n                      about taking a stable, good paying job as\n                      a consultant for the JDL.\n\n                                MRS.

C'mon.\n\n            The Hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to\n            the window. \n\n            We cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as\n            they try and get a better look outside.\n\n                                MRS.
