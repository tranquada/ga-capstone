He clutches his Sandy Koufax\n            lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got\n            quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age.\n\n            We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school.\n            Superimposed over the picture are the words, \"ST.

A very Vegas Merry\n            Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of\n            the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children\n            festively slap high fives as they open their presents.\n\n            We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his\n            brand new ATC motorbike.\n\n            We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an \"I\n            Love Jesus\" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow\n            affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face.\n\n            We cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic\n            excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears. \n\n            Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC.  \n\n<b>                                GENTILE BOY 1\n</b>                      Hey everybody!

MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly\n            Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and\n            appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has\n            weathered.

A\n            similar sign reading, \"KYKES GO HOME\" is turned outwards by\n            ANOTHER CLERK.

Mordechai slowly looks up. \n\n            A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger, and exits frame\n            as we hear him sadistically laugh O.S. the words \"Ho, ho, ho\"\n            at Morty.\n\n            We start CLOSE on Mordechai. Rage fills every inch of his\n            face.

His eyes look fearfully to\n            his right.  Below the picture frame is a plaque reading \"St.\n            Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941\", we continue a slow DOLLY to the\n            right on to the next picture.\n\n            We see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his\n            appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of\n            Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, \"St.\n            Nick The Nasty 1941-1970.\"\n\n            We continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a\n            painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the\n            plaque reads, \"St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present.\"\n\n            We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice\n            Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of\n            ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their\n            nameplates hang from their necks - \"BLITZEN\" and \"RUDOLPH.\"\n\n            At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAMIAN,\n            quite a nasty looking man. \n\n<b>                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n</b>                      My father, often referred to as St. Nick\n                      The Nasty, was a tyrannical man.

It's always been\n                      my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa\n                      deserve the same respect as Christmas. \n\n            Damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side, and then\n            makes the JERKING OFF motion with his hand. \n\n<b>                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n</b>                      Lights please.\n\n            As Rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room.

We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on\n            the slide projection screen behind him.\n\n<b>                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n</b>                      The heir to the Red Suit could be so\n                      filled with hate. \n\n            Santa addresses Damian.\n\n<b>                                SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)\n</b>                      Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous\n                      scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first\n                      reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm\n                      only filled with sadness and\n                      disappointment. Disappointed that I\n                      failed to teach you the true meaning of\n                      Christmas.

Blitzen returns the gesture with a\n            nod of acknowledgment.\n\n            With a slow and measured pace Damian says...\n\n<b>                                DAMIAN\n</b>                      Ho.

Damian cringes.\n\n            Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath\n            he utters the words...\n\n<b>                                SANTA CLAUS\n</b>                      Et tu, Blitzen?\n\n            Santa falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him\n            with bloodied antlers is Blitzen. \n\n            Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his\n            bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. From\n            this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be referred\n            to as SANTA.\n\n            The elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at\n            their new master in horror.\n\n<b>                                SANTA \n</b>                      What are you fucking midgets looking at!?\n                      Get back to work!

Hurry! \n\n            Harriet escorts the two into the passageway, and the door\n            slides shut behind them.\n\n<b>            INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n            We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an\n            'It's A Small World After All' type water ride. \n\n            Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the waiting\n            cars. The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket theme\n            going on. The 'Let My People Go' song, piped from unseen\n            speakers, is now at full strength.\n\n<b>                                HAMMER\n</b>                      You saved our lives. Thank you.

Just sit back, relax, and enjoy\n                      the ride.\n\n            The brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it\n            way from the loading dock.\n\n            Wide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings.\n\n            Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of\n            Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet\n            oddly entertaining way. \n\n            The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check\n            out the attraction in wonderment. \n\n            Esther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear\n            she's falling for him. \n\n            We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down\n            the river. A funkdafied version of the \"Let My People Go\"\n            song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride.\n\n<b>            EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\n            We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two\n            turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear\n            the muffled sounds of the gospel version of \"Let My People\n            Go.\" Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, \"HANUKKAH\n<b>            NOW!\"\n</b>\n            The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out\n            into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door,\n            and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley. \n\n<b>                                HAMMER\n</b>                      That got annoying fairly quickly.\n\n<b>                                ESTHER\n</b>                      Yeah, no kidding.\n\n            A CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground\n            Jewish Railroad' booth. \n\n<b>                                CARNIVAL WORKER\n</b>                      Tickets please.\n\n            The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets.\n\n<b>                                CARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D)\n</b>                      Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish\n                      Railroad.

It could easily pass for the\n            Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large\n            menorah shaped sign out front.\n\n<b>            INT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            We see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the\n            men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room,\n            stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly\n            demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections.\n\n            Onstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be\n            determined 70's funk classic.\n\n            Esther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the\n            BANDLEADER notices the two walk in...\n\n<b>                                BANDLEADER\n</b>                      Hey!

THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT\n</b>\n            A smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the\n            speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT\n            of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts\n            and moans a bit. \n\n            We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling\n            back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The\n            Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes,\n            forcing her into awkward positions, etc. \n\n            We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes\n            yet again.\n\n<b>                                ESTHER\n</b>                      Ouch!\n\n            Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer.\n\n<b>                                HAMMER\n</b>                      Sorry.

The line is pulled\n            taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe.\n\n            The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's\n            Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way\n            while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly\n            around his waist.

The Hammer makes the\n            silent military \"eyes\" gesture to Mo by pointing two fingers\n            at his eyes, indicating for him to check and see if the coast\n            is clear.\n\n            Mo bends out from the corner to look.
