FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY              \r\n\r\n    North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree-\r\n    lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex\r\n    set back from the curb.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n    Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30).\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               This is where where F. Scott\r\n               Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.\r\n\r\n    INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n               Fitzgerald was one of the truly great\r\n               American writers of the 20th century.\r\n               Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon.\r\n               This Side of Paradise. And, of course,\r\n               my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But\r\n               Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing\r\n               movies that never got made. Drinking\r\n               too much. Alienating people. Losing\r\n               his way.\r\n\r\n2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY             \r\n\r\n    Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope.\r\n    Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment,\r\n    more with reverence than curiosity.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: HENRY OBERT\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               I stop by here sometimes--out of\r\n               respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing\r\n               gift.\r\n\r\n3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS        \r\n\r\n    Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He\r\n    unlocks the car. Swings open the back door.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               But he wasted it. He wasted his\r\n               talent.\r\n\r\n    Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps\r\n    it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ.

Expensive\r\n    taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both\r\n    seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEY\r\n\r\n    They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera.\r\n\r\n                          ALAN\r\n              We thought this was going to be a\r\n              reality series.\r\n\r\n                          COLETTE\r\n              You know, like the Kardashians.\r\n\r\n    They listen.    Here comes the bad news.\r\n\r\n                          ALAN\r\n              Oh. Really? A documentary? This\r\n              is going to be a documentary about\r\n              our writing group?\r\n\r\n                          COLETTE\r\n              The whole group. Not just us, right?\r\n              Not that it should be just about\r\n              us...\r\n\r\n    Nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n                            ALAN\r\n              No.\r\n\r\n    They look at each other: A documentary?

ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - EVENING           \r\n\r\n    A POSTER BOARD SIGN--someone went to Kinko's--is posted\r\n    prominently reading: QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK.\r\n\r\n                          COLETTE (V.O.)\r\n                  (Reading)\r\n              ...consumed totally, completely,\r\n              absolutely, by endless thoughts of\r\n              Yuri fondling her breast, his other\r\n              hand groping her womanhood, knowing...\r\n\r\n    They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced\r\n    she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES.\r\n    The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize\r\n    Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious\r\n    notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming.\r\n\r\n    Three others round out the group:\r\n\r\n    Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the\r\n    coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCE\r\n\r\n    The OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms\r\n    folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZIN\r\n\r\n    Finally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening\r\n    intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on\r\n    her way here.\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI\r\n                                                                  4.\r\n\r\n                          COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n              ...Any second that she might explode,\r\n              her chastity spraying across the\r\n              ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling\r\n              like passionate graffiti. Natasha\r\n              never thought such a moment possible.\r\n              \"Have I satisfied you, Natasha?\"\r\n              Yuri had inquired after their fourth\r\n              round of vodka-soaked lovemaking.\r\n              \"Nyet, Not yet,\" Natasha stated,\r\n              exhausted, but grateful.\r\n\r\n    Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her\r\n    reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking\r\n    cheerful.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n              Well?   Comments?\r\n\r\n6   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       6\r\n\r\n    Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop\r\n    is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic\r\n    crates.\r\n\r\n    There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And\r\n    PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and\r\n    printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the\r\n    small apartment.\r\n\r\n    We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his\r\n    battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his\r\n    nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill\r\n    couch, watching TV.\r\n\r\n    Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out\r\n    a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his\r\n    accomplishment.\r\n\r\n                          HENRY (V.O.)\r\n              I graduated from the University of\r\n              Illinois. English major. Taught\r\n              high school for a couple years, but\r\n              hated it. Moved out here to be a\r\n              writer.\r\n\r\n7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             7\r\n\r\n    As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with\r\n    pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.\r\n\r\n                          HENRY (V.O.)\r\n              I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas\r\n              and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for\r\n              a writer.\r\n                                                                   5.\r\n\r\n8    INT.

HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       9\r\n\r\n     Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on\r\n     phrases like \"We regret to inform you,\" or \"Sorry, but this\r\n     story isn't right for us,\" or \"The Baxter Agency currently\r\n     isn't accepting new clients.\"\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               I have two unpublished novels.\r\n               Working on my third, Pizza to Go.\r\n               These are my rejection letters.\r\n               Rejected by agents. Rejected by\r\n               publishers. When you think about\r\n               it, it's pretty amazing how many\r\n               ways people can reject you.\r\n\r\n10   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               10\r\n\r\n     Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around\r\n     the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and\r\n     shrimp has been set out.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               Our writing group meets every Tuesday\r\n               night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's.\r\n               Sometimes we rotate.\r\n\r\n     John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to\r\n     some more.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n               I love coming to the group. Everyone\r\n               always has such constructive feedback.\r\n               It's like we're all in this together.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               I really like the way Yuri is\r\n               developing, Colette.\r\n\r\n                              COLETTE\r\n               You do?\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Well, if you ask John K. Butzin...\r\n\r\n     Can't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him.\r\n                                                              6.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n          You're still going to have to explain\r\n          why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on\r\n          her husband. Still kinda iffy to\r\n          me.\r\n\r\nAnother glance at the camera: Did you get that?\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          I was bothered by that, too. Why\r\n          would Natasha betray a reliable,\r\n          dependable husband for a washed-up\r\n          young punk?\r\n\r\nAll eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n                       COLETTE\r\n          Oh.   Well...um...um...\r\n\r\nAn uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go\r\ncreatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh God. I've been rewriting and\r\n          rewriting and rewriting and--\r\n\r\n                         ALAN\r\n          Poodles.     It's OK.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          No. It's not OK. I still can't\r\n          explain Natasha's motive. What's\r\n          the use? I'm not a writer.\r\n\r\nWilliam to the rescue.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM\r\n          Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's\r\n          good in bed. Trust me, that's all\r\n          the motive she needs.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three.\r\n          Blow it up.

Here it\r\n                really is all for one and one for\r\n                all.\r\n\r\n11   INT.

Meeting is over.\r\n\r\n     Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all\r\n     standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more\r\n     shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n                Who wants coffee?\r\n\r\n     Everybody does.

HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY                             13\r\n\r\n     Henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing\r\n     the Pizza Starz hat and shirt. Ready for work.\r\n\r\n                            HENRY (V.O.)\r\n                ...Haven't written a word in the\r\n                last two weeks. Not one.

ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               14\r\n\r\n     FLASHBACK to the last group meeting. Focus on Hannah. Her\r\n     smile. Her warmth. She listens and comments. Actively\r\n     engaged in the conversation.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (V.O.)\r\n               ...I keep thinking about her. She's\r\n               all I think about. Really would\r\n               like to ask her out.\r\n\r\n15   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      15\r\n\r\n     Hannah reaches for a pair of READING GLASSES and slips them\r\n     on. Talks to someone O.S.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               What do you think? On or off? Do\r\n               they make me look smarter? I need a\r\n               new pair.\r\n\r\n     She takes the glasses off. Puts them back on. Off again.\r\n     Debating. Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick\r\n     breaths and waves her hands in the air. Then she stares\r\n     directly into the camera.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               Hi. I'm originally from Prescott,\r\n               Arizona. Followed my mom out here\r\n               about four years ago. That's her\r\n               back there.\r\n\r\n     Camera picks up a wisp of a WOMAN (over 50)in the background,\r\n     waving, with an equally pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n     CAPTION: MAUREEN RINALDI\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               My parents are divorced. Not her\r\n               fault.\r\n\r\n16   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                           16\r\n\r\n     William favors jeans and faded tweed jacket. Sits in the\r\n     corner of a Valley restaurant, nursing a cup of coffee and\r\n     talks to the camera.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               What do you want to know about me?\r\n               I'm 27. Single. A virgin.\r\n\r\n     He flashes that wicked, seductive smile.\r\n                                                                  9.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               Just kidding. I'm actually 28.\r\n               Hometown is Modesto, California, A\r\n               sprawling junk heap of a town without\r\n               a soul. Why did I come to LA? Um,\r\n               because I knew you were here and\r\n               that you'd loan me a hundred bucks\r\n               if I needed it. Right?\r\n\r\n     WAITRESS #1 refills his coffee cup. Her reward is that smile.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               Thanks, babe.\r\n\r\n     She walks away.   William admires the view.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               I already got her number. Maybe I'll\r\n               text her. Maybe I won't.\r\n\r\n     Eyes back towards the camera.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               So 'bout that hundred bucks? What\r\n               d'ya think?\r\n\r\n     A hint of desperation in his voice.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               OK. What about fifty? C'mon, bro'.\r\n               Support the arts.\r\n\r\n17   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- DAY                                    17\r\n\r\n     Hannah continues talking to the camera.   Maureen still in\r\n     background.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               I've always had this knack for telling\r\n               stories. Ever since I was a kid.\r\n\r\n                           MAUREEN\r\n               She's a natural.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               Moved here. Took a couple writing\r\n               classes. Decided to go for it.\r\n               24/7. Total dedication to my craft.\r\n               The writing always comes first. My\r\n               latest effort is called Sleeping on\r\n               the Moon. It's about rejection. And\r\n               pain. Not really about the moon\r\n               itself. More of a...\r\n                                                                  10.\r\n\r\n     She searches for the word that escapes her.

I'm here because of Bukowski.\r\n               Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer\r\n               ever. Period.\r\n\r\n     INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Charles Bukowski.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               LA is his town, man. If I'm gonna\r\n               be a writer, then I have to walk in\r\n               Bukowski's shoes. Experience and\r\n               capture the plight of the working\r\n               class.\r\n\r\n     He waves to WAITRESS #1.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n               I like the people in the group. But\r\n               they can't write worth shit. But,\r\n               man, Hannah is something. She's the\r\n               only reason I keep going. Not because\r\n               I'm learning anything. Hell, no. I\r\n               just think she's hot.\r\n\r\n19   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- DAY                                     19\r\n\r\n     Hannah leans forward towards the camera, as if to hear better.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               My favorite writer? Favorite writer.\r\n               Favorite writer...\r\n\r\n     Hannah goes blank. The smile disappears as her face goes\r\n     into noticeable contortions. This is worse than Final\r\n     Jeopardy. She turns quiet, squirming.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've\r\n               studied Composition more than actual\r\n               Literature. Gee. I know Maureen\r\n               enjoys Jane...\r\n                                                               11.\r\n\r\n     Searching for a last name, Hannah looks back to Maureen for\r\n     help.\r\n\r\n                              MAUREEN\r\n               Jane Austen.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               That's the one. I hear she's good.\r\n               But my favorite writer? Let me think\r\n               about that a bit, OK?\r\n\r\n     Short beat. Hannah lowers her voice, almost a loud\r\n     confessional whisper.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               I didn't go to college.\r\n\r\n20   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                   20\r\n\r\n     John is holding court at his mobile home, showcasing the\r\n     finest in furniture from Sears. John stuffs his home with\r\n     various MILITARY ARTIFACTS--photos, equipment, books. He's\r\n     got it all. John talks to the camera.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Everything John K. Butzin knows\r\n               about writing comes down to two simple\r\n               words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom\r\n               Clancy. The man's a genius. Does\r\n               his research. All those nitty-gritty\r\n               technical details. Now that's writing!\r\n               John K. Butzin has one agent very\r\n               interested in Roaring Lion. And a\r\n               publisher up in Oxnard is looking at\r\n               it as we speak. Plus a certain\r\n               cousin's best friend has a neighbor\r\n               who has an in with Clint Eastwood,\r\n               so Hollywood might be calling soon.\r\n               Don't know how the other members of\r\n               the writing group will handle all\r\n               this success by one person. They\r\n               better not be pussies.\r\n\r\n21   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY              21\r\n\r\n     Alan and Colette remain on the couch. Talking to the camera.\r\n     All smiles. Much more comfortable with the camera.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               And I write full-time.\r\n                                                                 12.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Our last name's Mooney. You could\r\n               call us Mooneys. We get that joke\r\n               all the time.\r\n\r\n     The couple giggle at the joke. Forced.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Which writer do I admire? Hmmm. How\r\n               about John Grisham? Look at all\r\n               that money he's made! Just teasing,\r\n               John. We know you deserved every\r\n               dime, but, hey, John, could you spread\r\n               it around a bit, pal?\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               Alan likes to tease.\r\n\r\n     She gives her husband an affectionate squeeze.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Colette, here, is the real writer.\r\n               I'm more of an idea guy. I come up\r\n               with great ideas, but don't always\r\n               follow through. I'll show you.\r\n\r\n     He picks up his mini-digital Olympus RECORDER off the coffee\r\n     table. Thinks for a second.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n                   (To recorder)\r\n               Idea for romantic novel.\r\n\r\n     Alan catches himself.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               No. Make that, idea for romantic\r\n               ebook.\r\n\r\n     He winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Possible movie option, too: Frovers.\r\n               They couldn't be friends. They\r\n               couldn't be lovers. So they became\r\n               Frovers.\r\n\r\n     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.\r\n\r\n22   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       22\r\n\r\n     Colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a\r\n     beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows\r\n     her over to a solitary BENCH.\r\n                                                                 13.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n                This is where I come for inspiration.\r\n                I believe a writer must have quiet\r\n                and solitude. I'll meditate. Write\r\n                in my journal. Set out my creative\r\n                path for the day. This is my Walden\r\n                Pond.\r\n\r\n     Colette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n                Favorite author? I'd have to say\r\n                Joan Didion. Her writing sends\r\n                shivers down my spine. Though Joyce\r\n                Carol Oates has been known to bring\r\n                me to actual orgasm.\r\n\r\n23   EXT.

Colette appears to\r\n     be getting into the story just a bit too much.\r\n\r\n24   EXT.

They exchange puzzled looks.\r\n\r\n25   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       25\r\n\r\n     Back to the present. Camera picks up a FRAMED PHOTO OF OPRAH\r\n     from a corner of the bench. Holds it up for camera.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n                Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for\r\n                luck. She's done so much to help\r\n                writers. I know I'm going to be on\r\n                her television show one day. I just\r\n                know it.\r\n\r\n     Colette can already see the moment in her mind. Short beat.\r\n     Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n                What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show\r\n                anymore? Really? Since when?\r\n\r\n     Short beat as she hears the answer.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n                Oh...\r\n\r\n     Short beat as she tries to cover.\r\n                                                                    14.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n               I knew that.

I've got to take action.\r\n               Still stuck on Page 100. So I'm\r\n               asking Hannah out on a date tonight.\r\n               It'll be great. And I'll put this\r\n               writer's block behind me.\r\n\r\n     Checks his appearance one last time in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n               Wish me luck.\r\n\r\n27   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                 27\r\n\r\n     Alan sits in his favorite chair, talking directly to the\r\n     camera.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               I'm the group leader. After all,\r\n               getting together was my idea. They're\r\n               all my patients. That's how we met.\r\n               First one published gets a free eye\r\n               exam.\r\n\r\n     Alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke.    He listens to a\r\n     question being asked.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Why did I form the group? To help\r\n               Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the\r\n               creative process, but Colette?\r\n               Writing is her dream. I'd do anything\r\n               for her because...because she's my\r\n               dream. So there you have it.\r\n\r\n     Alan reaches for his tape recorder.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Possible names for future characters.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n                                                                 15.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Anthony Gilmore. No, wait. Make\r\n               that Anthony T. Gilmore. Much\r\n               better. Slate McCoy. Fletcher Peck.\r\n               Fiona Foxx. And...a man known simply\r\n               as Banjo.\r\n\r\n     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.\r\n\r\n28   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        28\r\n\r\n     Place is empty. Alan, Colette, William, John, and Henry\r\n     gather around the center table.\r\n\r\n     The WRITERS AT WORK poster is propped up against a nearby\r\n     empty chair. Hard not to notice the EMPTY CHAIR at the table.\r\n     Hannah is missing.\r\n\r\n     Waitress #1 pours coffee all around. Henry fidgets in his\r\n     chair, focused on the empty chair.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n                   (To William)\r\n               How come we never chow down at your\r\n               place?\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               This is my place. Close to the working\r\n               people.\r\n\r\n     John rolls his eyes.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               Where's Hannah? Anyone know?\r\n\r\n     Nobody responds. Alan checks his watch.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Time to get started.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               Shouldn't we wait for Hannah?\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               Let's go, people.

Henry eyes the empty chair.\r\n     Colette looks over William's pages. There are only three.\r\n     She has a puzzled look.\r\n                                                               16.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               William, aren't these the same pages\r\n               you read last time?\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               Nope, they're different.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               They look the same.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               They're different. I changed a word.\r\n\r\n                             HENRY\r\n               One word?\r\n\r\n                             COLETTE\r\n               That's it?\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               Writing is rewriting, Colette.\r\n               Bukowski said, \"Write five words.\r\n               Rewrite seven.\"\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               No. Dorothy Parker said that.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN\r\n               One word?

RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      29\r\n\r\n     The evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to\r\n     stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel.\r\n\r\n     HANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned.\r\n                                                             17.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          I wonder what happened to Hannah.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          It's not like her to miss.\r\n\r\nThe mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes\r\nHannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried.\r\n\r\n                       HANNAH\r\n          I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing\r\n          the meeting.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          What happened? Your car break down?\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          You oversleep?\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Maureen. Is Maureen OK?\r\n\r\n                     WILLIAM\r\n          People. C'mon. Look at her. That\r\n          glow. Hannah met a guy. She got\r\n          laid.\r\n\r\nHannah gives William a playful smack on the back.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          As a matter of fact, I did meet a\r\n          guy.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM\r\n          Told ya.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          His name's Brian.\r\n\r\nCheck out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No!\r\n\r\nHannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of\r\nthe Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          He's my new agent!\r\n\r\nShe remembers the camera.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n              (Directly to camera)\r\n          An agent. I've got an agent!\r\n\r\nSurprise and silence. The writers look at each other and\r\nthen back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react.\r\n                                                                 18.\r\n\r\n     Stunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n                That writing class I took? Well,\r\n                for the final project, I turned in\r\n                the first chapter of Sleeping on the\r\n                Moon. I guess the teacher liked it.\r\n                Then he gave it to his friend who's\r\n                an agent. Brian. He called. Had to\r\n                see me right away. Brian wants to\r\n                sign me.\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM\r\n                Bet Brian wants more than that.\r\n\r\n     Playful smack from Colette to William on the shoulder: Behave.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n                That's so great, Hannah.\r\n\r\n                            JOHN\r\n                I salute you, young lady.\r\n\r\n     And he does.\r\n\r\n                             ALAN\r\n                Yes.   Fantastic. Fanntasstic.\r\n\r\n     Henry takes it all in quietly, unable to speak.\r\n\r\n     Alan bounces up and gives Hannah a big hug as the others\r\n     immediately start peppering her with questions.\r\n\r\n30   INT.

RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        31\r\n\r\n     Alan pops the drugstore CHAMPAGNE and pours into the cheap\r\n     plastic cups, as Colette passes them around to Hannah, Henry,\r\n     John, and William.\r\n\r\n                            ALAN\r\n                    (Raising cup)\r\n                To Hannah!\r\n\r\n     Everyone clinks their cups together.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH\r\n                Thank you. But I just want to remind\r\n                everyone that we're all in this\r\n                together. I couldn't have come this\r\n                far without the group.\r\n                                                                19.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n                   (Smiling)\r\n               All for one . . . .\r\n\r\n     But our camera picks up on the individual writers and\r\n     something is amiss. Everything seems a beat off. People\r\n     appear happy, but a little subdued. The joy seems a bit too\r\n     forced.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               I'm merely the first one to get\r\n               signed. But we're all going to have\r\n               an agent soon.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Well, as a matter of fact, there's\r\n               an agent in Santa Monica very\r\n               interested in John K. Butzin. He's\r\n               reading the manuscript as we speak.\r\n\r\n     The others let John's remark pass without comment.   William\r\n     taps Henry on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n                   (Lower voice)\r\n               Hey, can you lend me ten bucks?\r\n\r\n     Henry is still a bit dazed by this unexpected turn of events.\r\n\r\n                            HENRY\r\n               Sure.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               Thanks, bro'.

Alan carries his\r\n     WRITERS AT WORK sign.\r\n\r\n     William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever-\r\n     protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting\r\n     William off. They start walking in one direction. William\r\n     and John head out in the other.

Tries to change the subject.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               Listen. Maybe some afternoon we\r\n               could go for a drive.

MONTAGE OF SHOTS - DAY                                        34\r\n\r\n     A series of shots featuring the writers writing--or, at least,\r\n     trying: Alan pauses between eye appointments to record an\r\n     idea.\r\n\r\n     William continues scribbling at the restaurant, this time\r\n     eyeing WAITRESS #2.\r\n\r\n     Hannah, sitting cross-legged on her bed, types away on her\r\n     laptop computer.\r\n\r\n     Colette sits on her private bench, seeking inspiration.\r\n\r\n     John sits at his keyboard. Vintage black-and-white war movie\r\n     plays on the TV. John appears more interested in the movie.\r\n\r\n     Henry stares at his laptop. The screen is blank. Henry\r\n     surrenders yet again and flips off the computer.\r\n\r\n35   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       35\r\n\r\n     Henry, sitting in his studio apartment, wears his pizza\r\n     delivery outfit. Ready for work. Talks to the camera.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               I'm happy for Hannah.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n                                                                  22.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n               Still, her getting an agent sort of\r\n               ruins my plans, doesn't it? I mean,\r\n               Hannah has an agent. I don't. That\r\n               won't work for dating. I can't ask\r\n               her out until I get an agent.\r\n\r\n     Henry gestures at a PHOTOGRAPH taped to the wall among his\r\n     rejection letters.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n               That's Richard Benedict. He's written\r\n               seven novels. Fantastic writer.\r\n\r\n     INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Richard Benedict.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n               The Fitzgerald of his generation.\r\n               Richard Benedict made me want to be\r\n               a writer.\r\n\r\n36   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 36\r\n\r\n     Colette dressed in a leotard, practices basic yoga on a mat\r\n     in her living room. Chanting. Overly dramatic, as always.\r\n\r\n     Takes a break and talks to the camera.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet.\r\n               It's about a Russian woman who comes\r\n               to this country in search of love.\r\n               It was inspired by a story I heard\r\n               from one of my massage clients, Yuri.\r\n               Yes, it's true--I used to do massage.\r\n               In fact, that's how I met Alan, though\r\n               I certainly didn't give him the kind\r\n               of massage he really wanted. At least\r\n               not the first time.\r\n\r\n     Colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n               I will get an agent. It comes down\r\n               to this: if Hannah can get an agent,\r\n               I can get an agent. After all, I am\r\n               a graduate of Mills College.\r\n\r\n37   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      37\r\n\r\n     Plopped down in her rocking chair, Hannah talks to someone\r\n     O.S. Maureen goes about her day in the background.\r\n                                                          23.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Have I thought of my favorite author\r\n          yet? No. Not yet. There are so\r\n          many, you know?\r\n\r\nThe deep breaths and waving of hands begin again. Here comes\r\nthat smile as she looks directly into the camera.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          So. I am somewhat superstitious.\r\n          Yes. Guilty. I'm drawn to the number\r\n          4. I was born at exactly 4:04 p.m.\r\n          on April 4th. 4-4-4-4. That wasn't\r\n          an accident. No way.\r\n\r\nShe's dead serious.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          Certain things I've learned to avoid.\r\n          Black cats. Cracked mirrors. Oh.\r\n          And the number 13 especially. I hate\r\n          the number 13. Hate it.\r\n\r\nConversation interrupted by RINGING DOORBELL. Hannah frowns\r\nat the interruption as Maureen scurries to the door and opens\r\nit, revealing Colette hiding behind a HUGE GIFT BASKET. She\r\nbreezes in. Takes over. Over the top.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Hi...Hi...Hello everyone. I was\r\n          just in the neighborhood and--\r\n\r\nColette freezes when she notices the camera.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh, Hannah. I'm so sorry. I didn't\r\n          know they'd be here--\r\n\r\nYeah, right. Hannah springs up. Follows Colette as she sets\r\nthe basket down for all to admire.\r\n\r\n                        HANNAH\r\n          Colette.    What a lovely surprise!\r\n\r\nHugs all around between Hannah and Maureen and Colette.\r\nHannah looks blown away by the gift basket.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          My, what's this?\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Oh. It's nothing. I just had to\r\n          say \"Congratulations\" to my new\r\n          favorite author.\r\n                                                            24.\r\n\r\nHannah is truly touched.    Maureen notices a CARD attached to\r\nthe basket.\r\n\r\n                      MAUREEN\r\n              (Reading)\r\n          \"For Poodles...Now may we have sex\r\n          again? Love, Alan.\"\r\n\r\nWhat? Embarrassed, Colette snatches the card from Maureen.\r\nHannah is more focused on the gift. Doesn't really hear.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          So sweet of you, Colette.\r\n\r\n                         COLETTE\r\n          My pleasure.     Say, Hannah...about\r\n          your agent?\r\n\r\nHannah looks over at Colette: What?\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n          Is he--Is he taking on new clients?\r\n\r\n                       HANNAH\r\n          Gee.   I don't really know.\r\n\r\nColette blurts out without thinking.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Think you could ask?\r\n\r\nAwkward situation for Hannah.      How best to respond?\r\n\r\n                         HANNAH\r\n          I guess so.     Maybe.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Because if he is...\r\n\r\n                       HANNAH\r\n          Let's talk about this at group\r\n          meeting, OK?\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Oh. Of course. Of course.\r\n          Absolutely.\r\n\r\nLong beat. Conversation over. The three women wait for one\r\nanother to speak. Colette checks her watch.\r\n\r\n                         COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n          Well...\r\n\r\nA hug for both Maureen and Hannah.\r\n                                                                 25.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n               I've got to go. Talk soon. By the\r\n               way, everything in the basket--gluten\r\n               free!\r\n\r\n     A final wave to the camera and Colette disappears.\r\n\r\n                           MAUREEN\r\n               Colette Mooney. My, that woman is\r\n               something else.\r\n\r\n     A light goes off in Hannah's head.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n                   (To herself; counting\r\n                    on her fingers)\r\n               Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o-\r\n               n-e...\r\n\r\n     She can't finish the count. The ugly truth is staring her in\r\n     the face.\r\n\r\n                             HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               13 letters.    Oh, dear...\r\n\r\n     Hannah and Maureen exchange concerned looks.\r\n\r\n38   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE   DAY                                          38\r\n\r\n     Hannah and Henry sit together in the reception area. Alan\r\n     breezes in, ever-smiling, greeting both enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n39   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          39\r\n\r\n     Rows of EYE GLASSES on display as Alan guides Hannah over to\r\n     the fitting table. Henry tags along.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               No problemo. Let's get you some new\r\n               eye wear.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               Something that makes me look smart.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               You're already smart, Hannah.\r\n\r\n     Hannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you.\r\n     Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry\r\n     pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them\r\n     on Hannah.\r\n                                                              26.\r\n\r\n                         ALAN\r\n          How about...\r\n\r\nHannah shrugs her blase reaction.\r\n\r\n                         HANNAH\r\n          Mmmmmmm.\r\n\r\nAlan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a\r\nsecond. Then -- inspiration arrives.\r\n\r\n                       ALAN\r\n          Excuse me.   One sec.\r\n\r\nHe reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Ah. Name for character. Alexander\r\n          Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Of course he would.\r\n\r\nHenry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder\r\naway and reaches for another pair of glasses.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          You know this great idea for a novel\r\n          hit me this morning. It's called\r\n          Unleashed.\r\n\r\nAlan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in\r\nthe mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head:\r\nNo. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan\r\nreaches for pair #3.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n          It's about a dog who becomes human\r\n          for 24 hours in order to rescue his\r\n          kidnapped owner. I love this idea,\r\n          Hannah.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Could be a winner.\r\n\r\nAlan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah. She checks\r\nherself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She\r\nlooks over towards Henry.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          What do you think?\r\n\r\nPoor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for\r\nher by the moment.\r\n                                                               27.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               You look great, Hannah.\r\n\r\n     Hannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as\r\n     Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps\r\n     a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Question: You think your agent might\r\n               be interested in this idea? Does he\r\n               have a dog?\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n                   (Evading)\r\n               Oh. I don't know--\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               How about a cat? It could be a cat.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH\r\n               Um. Sure.   Probably could be.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Think about mentioning it to your\r\n               agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat --\r\n               becomes human.\r\n\r\n     Alan beams with pride at his imagination on display. Hannah\r\n     fidgets. Avoids Alan. Henry jumps in to save the moment.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               I'll help you develop the idea, Alan.\r\n\r\n     Alan looks pleased. Hannah looks grateful.\r\n\r\n40   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                        40\r\n\r\n     The TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN (CUSTOMER #1 AND CUSTOMER #2) sit\r\n     across from each other in the nearly-deserted restaurant.\r\n\r\n     Body language suggests an intense, passionate, personal chat.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (V.O.)\r\n               A writer has to hear everything. On\r\n               the streets. In the restaurants.\r\n\r\n     But something's amiss. Customer #1 stops abruptly, glancing\r\n     at the table next to them: William has suddenly materialized.\r\n     Sitting with a cup of coffee and a legal pad, scribbling.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n               My dialogue has to be real so I'm\r\n               everywhere. Standing behind you at\r\n               the checkout stand.\r\n                                                             28.\r\n\r\nCustomer #1 resumes conversation, but looks sharply back at\r\nWilliam. His head is tilted towards them. Listening.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Peeing next to you at the urinal. I\r\n          watch. I listen.\r\n\r\nCustomer #1 says something to Customer #2. Looks back at\r\nWilliam. His head is still cocked as he makes notes.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Writing down scraps of conversation.\r\n\r\nCustomer #1 grows more agitated. Customer #2 tries to calm\r\nher down. Finally, Customer #1 shoots up and marches over\r\nto William, her finger jabbing in the air towards the\r\nnotebook. William shrugs, playing dumb.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          That's right. I eavesdrop.\r\n\r\nCustomer #1 reaches down and grabs the notebook from William.\r\nHe tries to stop her, but too late.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          How else do you accurately capture\r\n          the misery of the human condition?\r\n\r\nShe reads the page and shows it to Cutomer #2 who reads the\r\nnotes and is equally shocked.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Now Bukowski says \"An intellectual\r\n          says a simple thing in a hard way.\"\r\n\r\nThe two women start yelling at William. He keeps shaking his\r\nhead. Customer #1 tears the page into shreds.\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          \"An artist says a hard thing in a\r\n          simple way.\"\r\n\r\nWaitress #2 comes over. The women talk to her and she starts\r\nyelling at William. Customer #1 poking her finger in his\r\nchest. Escalates to a push. The COOK comes out and starts\r\nyelling at William.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Gotta love it. That's me.

The reason why sits next to him\r\n     in the matching LAWN CHAIRS.\r\n\r\n     The WOMAN is clearly younger than John. Plainly dressed in a\r\n     faded sweat shirt. Little makeup.

Warm embrace.\r\n                                                                32.\r\n\r\n     In turn, they both embrace Henry, who also shares the\r\n     genuine, sincere moment.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               You did it, Hannah!

She goes to Henry and\r\n     gives him a tight hug. So very tight. Blesses him with another\r\n     friendly peck on the lips.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               Thank you, my friend.

Fitzgerald was her lover.\r\n          This is where he died on December\r\n          21, 1940.\r\n\r\nHannah lets it all sink in.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot\r\n          himself, right?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          No. Fitzgerald. F.

Lowers her voice.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          I've never read The Great Gatsby.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          You're kidding.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Henry. I never went to college.\r\n          I've heard of Hemingway. A little.\r\n          Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't\r\n          have your education. Your smarts. I\r\n          haven't read all these great novels.\r\n          My stories come from my heart.\r\n\r\nHenry lets it all sink in.    Hannah looks at the house.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          Tell me about the book.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          Gatsby is about social position and\r\n          the American Dream and . . .\r\n\r\nHenry stops. Rethinks his explanation.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Actually, it's quite simple. Boy\r\n          meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy\r\n          moves heaven and earth to win the\r\n          girl back.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          And it's your favorite?\r\n\r\nHenry nods with his heart.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          So how does it end? Does boy get the\r\n          girl?\r\n\r\nLong beat. Then Henry reaches into the back seat of his car\r\nfor his KNAPSACK. Puts it on his lap, unzips it. Pulls out\r\nhis personal copy of Gatsby.\r\n                                                                  48.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n               Here. Take my copy.\r\n\r\n     He hands the well-read book to Hannah.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n               Now you can find out for yourself.\r\n\r\n60   INT.

So what the hell you\r\n               going to do about this?

More than a\r\n     little concerned at what she is hearing.\r\n\r\n61   INT.

HANNAH'S APARTMENT / CITY STREET - DAY                       62\r\n\r\n     Parked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry\r\n     and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the\r\n     car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               What a dear, sweet friend you are.\r\n\r\n     Hannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on\r\n     the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back.\r\n     More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls\r\n     back--her hand on his chest: Stop.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Gently)\r\n               No distractions. The writing comes\r\n               first, 'kay?\r\n\r\n     Henry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah\r\n     before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her\r\n     shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that\r\n     this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life.\r\n\r\n63   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    63\r\n\r\n     The writing group meets. Hannah, Henry, John, William, Alan\r\n     and Colette sit around the living room, pages in front of\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     WRITERS AT WORK sign on display.\r\n\r\n     Maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to\r\n     writer, carrying a large TRAY OF VEGGIES.\r\n\r\n                            ALAN\r\n               Alright.   Whose turn is it to read?\r\n               Henry?\r\n\r\n     All eyes on Henry.

Still can't focus.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          Don't be a pussy, Obert.

Maureen offers William some veggies.\r\nHe helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to\r\nAlan.\r\n\r\n                      WILLIAM\r\n          What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've\r\n          got Scott and Christy. Two friends.\r\n          Tell their story.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          That's the problem. I think the\r\n          story's changing.\r\n\r\n                       ALAN\r\n          Changing?   How so?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          Lately I'm feeling something much\r\n          deeper, much richer. Scott and\r\n          Christy, um, growing closer.\r\n\r\nThe other group members appear puzzled.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author\r\n          in Beverly Hills. How close can they\r\n          get?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          Follow me. Something happens.\r\n          Christy has an epiphany. She-She\r\n          realizes her feelings run much deeper\r\n          now for Scott.\r\n                                                               52.\r\n\r\nHenry does everything he can not to look at Hannah. Short\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAM\r\n          Nah.    Don't buy it.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          They're friends. Why muck it up?\r\n          Don't put 'em in the same foxhole.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Is this Scott wanting to go beyond\r\n          the friendship? There's no way\r\n          Christy would suggest it. What do\r\n          you think, Hannah?\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          Yes. Hannah, what do you think?\r\n\r\nAll eyes go back to Hannah.     She does not want to answer.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Gee, I-I guess...I really never\r\n          thought of them that way.\r\n\r\n                        HENRY\r\n          Never?\r\n\r\nHannah shakes her head.   Chooses her words carefully.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          No. It's always been a friendship.\r\n\r\nHenry takes a moment.   Thinking.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          You don't see anything possibly\r\n          happening between them?\r\n\r\n                        HANNAH\r\n          No.    Friends. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAM\r\n          Exactly.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          I'd be uncomfortable with any changes\r\n          in the relationship.\r\n\r\nMessage received. All eyes on Henry. Defeated.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          OK. Thanks, everyone. I'll try to\r\n          have something on paper next time.\r\n                                                                  53.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Remember, Obert.

She follows, looking puzzled. Henry\r\n     watches with curiosity. William starts speaking to Hannah in\r\n     hushed tones, trying not to let anyone else overhear the\r\n     conversation.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               How much?\r\n\r\n     More hushed tones from William. Hannah shakes her head.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n               But if I loaned you money, then I\r\n               wouldn't have it.\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM\r\n               Hey, I just figured, you know. You\r\n               got that big advance. Help out a\r\n               fellow writer. I'm good for it,\r\n               Hannah.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n               Sorry.

Henry and Hannah make eye\r\n     contact. Henry looks to her: Are we OK? Hannah looks away.\r\n\r\n     Colette comes up next to William.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               How much do you need?\r\n\r\n     William looks surprised.\r\n\r\n65   INT.

Henry and Hannah sit apart.\r\n\r\n     A single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them. Hannah\r\n     reads from her typed pages. Alan, William, Colette, and Henry\r\n     hang on her every word.\r\n\r\n     John is half-listening at best, more interested in the\r\n     MAGAZINE he's thumbing through.\r\n\r\n     William REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colette's\r\n     hand. Surprised, she pulls her hand away.\r\n\r\n                           HANNAH\r\n                   (Reading; with feeling)\r\n               \"Please come home, Michael.\" \"Why\r\n               would you want to marry me, Kyra?

It's\r\n     his turn to be surprised.\r\n\r\n     Hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone\r\n     to react. The room falls silent.

William ignores her.\r\n\r\n     John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't\r\n     concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV.\r\n     Another war movie.\r\n\r\n     Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters.\r\n\r\n     Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working\r\n     at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep,\r\n     deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind.\r\n\r\n70   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY - DAY                    70\r\n\r\n     Alan arrives home. Steps out of his Lexus. Whistling. Happy-\r\n     go-lucky. Pauses in the driveway to record another idea.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay.\r\n               The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg.

ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 71\r\n\r\n     Alan sails through the front door. His smile disappears.\r\n     William is plopped on the living room couch. Shirt half\r\n     unbuttoned. Smoking. He freezes mid-puff.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               William?\r\n                                                                58.\r\n\r\n                               WILLIAM\r\n                Hey.   Alan.\r\n\r\n     SOUND OF SHOWER AND COLETTE SINGING OFF-KEY echoes throughout\r\n     the house. Alan turns quiet as he makes the connection.\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM (CONT'D)\r\n                Just, um. Just stopped by to...read\r\n                some pages for Colette. Yeah.\r\n\r\n     There are no pages on the coffee table in front of William.\r\n\r\n72   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER                            72\r\n\r\n     Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the\r\n     Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission.\r\n     What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately,\r\n     zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs\r\n     Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his\r\n     hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards\r\n     the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on\r\n     the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on\r\n     the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends\r\n     down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands.\r\n     There. That felt good.\r\n\r\n     Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.    What\r\n     the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.\r\n\r\n73   INT.

HANNAH'S APARTMENT - EVENING                                75\r\n\r\n     A spruced-up Henry sits down for dinner.

Colette talks to the camera.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               Yes. You noticed. I replaced the\r\n               photo. I may be replacing other\r\n               things around here soon...I was just\r\n               using William...for research.\r\n\r\n     She holds up THREE MORE LETTERS.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n               Speaking of rejection...three more\r\n               letters saying Nyet, including one\r\n               from David Keller. I should have\r\n               offered him a massage. How much\r\n               more rejection can I take?\r\n\r\n     Colette stares at the letters, focusing on remaining strong.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Reciting)\r\n               \"We keep going back, stronger, not\r\n               weaker, because we will not allow--\r\n\r\n     Her voice cracks.

Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy\r\n     to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM.\r\n\r\n     It isn't enough today. Watch as Colette's solemn chant\r\n     dissolves into tears of frustration.\r\n                                                                  60.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying\r\n     to calm Colette down.\r\n\r\n78   EXT.

He cleans up pretty good.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               This is going to be a great day for\r\n               John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First\r\n               official book signing.\r\n\r\n     Sigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover\r\n     has had an image of a lion slapped over it.

Of course,\r\n               it would have been better to do this\r\n               in an actual bookstore, but, hell,\r\n               they're dropping faster than Charlie\r\n               at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid\r\n               works at the hardware store, they're\r\n               going to let her favorite author\r\n               sign a few books there.\r\n\r\n                           SIGRID\r\n               More than a few books.

CUSTOMERS walk all around,\r\n     ignoring John completely. John tries to stay relaxed, smiling\r\n     and nodding at people, not being too forceful.\r\n\r\n     Sigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands\r\n     off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a\r\n     cash register, takes the telephone out of her surprised boss'\r\n     hand, and jumps on the store's PA SYSTEM, blasting throughout\r\n     the store.\r\n                                                                61.\r\n\r\n                           SIGRID\r\n                   (On PA system)\r\n               Attention shoppers.

His face brightens. A smiling Alan\r\n     has arrived, flanked by Colette, Henry and Hannah. Hannah\r\n     holds a cupcake. Alan has a bottle of champagne and some\r\n     plastic cups. But there is no touching, no direct\r\n     interaction, between Colette and Alan.\r\n\r\n                             ALAN\r\n               Author!    Author!\r\n\r\n     John stands up.

That's right: 1-2-3-4-5-\r\n               6-7-8-9-10-11.

And now Butzin.\r\n               It's a humbling thought.\r\n\r\n     John goes back to his routine. Sigrid offers up a supportive\r\n     smile, but she doesn't seem quite as impressed.\r\n\r\n84   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT            84\r\n\r\n     Alan sits at the writers' table. Alone.

It has\r\n               nothing to do with the fact that I'm\r\n               now sleeping in the guest room. But\r\n               let's face it--the kid's a slacker.\r\n               No contribution to the group. Zero.\r\n               Zip. Nada.

Hannah. Hannah. We could\r\n           have been so hot together. I'm just\r\n           as good a writer as you are, but you\r\n           sure look better in a skirt --\r\n\r\n                       HENRY\r\n               (Voice rising)\r\n           That's enough.\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM\r\n           I don't need any of you. I don't\r\n           need any of your pointless, pedestrian\r\n           feedback. I'm a writer.\r\n\r\n                       JOHN\r\n           You've got goddamn three pages.\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM\r\n           They're a great three pages! You\r\n           just don't appreciate my dedication.\r\n\r\n                       HANNAH\r\n           You're a pretend writer, William.\r\n\r\nSilence.   William is surprised that Hannah speaks out.\r\n\r\n                       HENRY\r\n           She's right. You act the part. You\r\n           like the lifestyle. You hit on women.\r\n           You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did\r\n           the work. Each and every day he\r\n           wrote. That's your problem, William.\r\n           You don't do the work.\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM\r\n           I don't do the work? Man, that sounds\r\n           frickin' hilarious coming from you.\r\n           When's the last time you wrote\r\n           anything?\r\n\r\nThat hits a nerve. William and Henry stare each other down.\r\nEnough. William flips off the group with his middle finger.\r\nMumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave.\r\nPauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign. Picks it up.\r\n                                                                 66.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Not the sign!\r\n\r\n     Too late. William RIPS it in two. And a second time for\r\n     good measure. Throwing the pieces on the ground. Stomps out\r\n     of the house, slamming the front door.\r\n\r\n     The group turns quiet for a long beat. Everyone calming down.\r\n\r\n     Alan takes control again -- eyes still darting over to what's\r\n     left of his beloved sign.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Let's move on.

Because Richard Benedict\r\n     is in the building, doing a signing of his new novel The\r\n     Pineapple Man.\r\n\r\n     Hannah, Henry, Alan, and Colette stand in line together,\r\n     waiting. Colette is holding one copy of the BOOK. Hannah\r\n     has one. Henry has one.\r\n\r\n     Alan reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Snaps\r\n     it on.\r\n\r\n                           ALAN\r\n               Idea for novel.

Alan cranes\r\n     his neck to see what's happening.\r\n\r\n                           HENRY\r\n                   (To himself)\r\n               Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank\r\n               you. No. You've inspired my writing--\r\n               No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're\r\n               the greatest...\r\n\r\n     Colette puts a friendly hand on Henry's shoulder.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE\r\n               Let me tell you something, Henry.\r\n                                                                67.\r\n\r\n     Henry looks to her, expecting words of comfort.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n               One day, I'll have a signing like\r\n               this.\r\n\r\n     Colette looks around, already imagining the event.\r\n\r\n87   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    87\r\n\r\n     John is bent over his PRINTER, jiggling the front end, trying\r\n     to open it. Tapping it on the side. No luck.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Nope. Not going to see Richard\r\n               whatever-his-name-is. John K.\r\n               Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand\r\n               in line anymore. No, sir. This soon-\r\n               to-be best-selling writer is spending\r\n               every minute, every dollar, on\r\n               promoting Roaring Lion.\r\n\r\n     Try as he might, John can't open up his printer. Sigrid\r\n     appears. Leans in. Effortlessly opens up the printer. Takes\r\n     the cartridge from John. Snaps it in. Shuts the lid. Done.\r\n     John grunts his thanks.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n               Strudel, check my sales ranking again.\r\n\r\n     Sigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys.

Look how far I've moved up\r\n               already.\r\n\r\n     Sigrid types again.

Watch Sigrid as her eyes\r\n     dart around--from the screen, to John in the chair, out the\r\n     window. Back again. This is the moment. Sigrid gets it\r\n     now: John K. Butzin is not the author he pretends to be.\r\n     Very quiet in the mobile home.\r\n                                                                  68.\r\n\r\n88   INT.

Good luck trying to rip it from\r\n     his hands.

Henry seems transfixed by him. Now it's his turn to\r\n     have his book signed.\r\n\r\n                           CLERK\r\n               Next, please.\r\n\r\n     The moment has arrived. Henry stands directly in front of\r\n     Richard Benedict. Henry seems nervous. Too nervous to speak.\r\n     Richard looks up and for the slightest, milli-second their\r\n     eyes meet.\r\n\r\n     At that exact moment, RICHARD'S CELL PHONE GOES OFF. He\r\n     answers.\r\n\r\n                           RICHARD\r\n                   (On phone)\r\n               What?!\r\n\r\n     Henry stands there, unable to move, staring at Richard while\r\n     he speaks on the phone.\r\n\r\n                              CLERK\r\n                      (To Henry)\r\n               Sir?\r\n\r\n     No response.

We need to keep the line moving.\r\n          Sir?\r\n\r\nAlan intervenes. He takes Henry's copy of the novel and slides\r\nit over to Benedict. Benedict scribbles his name quickly and\r\nslides it back with no eye contact, yelling on the phone.\r\n\r\n                      RICHARD\r\n              (On phone)\r\n          Absolutely not!

Another scribbled signature as he remains on\r\nthe phone.\r\n\r\nColette takes the book, trying not to look hurt. Alan grabs\r\nHenry and they leave the area. Hannah is next up. She puts\r\nher book down on the table.\r\n\r\n                      RICHARD\r\n              (On phone)\r\n          Damn it! That simply won't--\r\n\r\nRichard glances up.

Camera goes over to the shell-shocked\r\nHenry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and\r\nRichard carry on. Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees\r\nthat he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and\r\nmatching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah,\r\nwaving at him.\r\n                                                               70.\r\n\r\n89   EXT.

On the discount table up by the cash register lies a\r\n     pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50%\r\n     OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet\r\n     contemplation. Heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n     Sigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash\r\n     register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns\r\n     the smile.\r\n\r\n     Back to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from\r\n     her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books,\r\n     one by one.\r\n\r\n94   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                     94\r\n\r\n     John looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store.   In\r\n     total shock as he clutches a handful of TWENTIES.\r\n\r\n                           JOHN\r\n               Wow!

Write\r\n               it and they will read.\r\n\r\n     John can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile\r\n     home, his mind racing.

PHONES constantly chirping.\r\n\r\n     The young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid\r\n     to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in\r\n     large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\r\n\r\n     Colette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a\r\n     thick MANILA ENVELOPE.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n               I have to see Ms. Piper.

I know she's busy,\r\n               but she'll certainly want to see my\r\n               manuscript.\r\n\r\n     The assistant ignores her.\r\n\r\n                           COLETTE (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Flustered)\r\n               I'm a graduate of Mills College.\r\n\r\n     Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPER\r\n     YELLING.\r\n\r\n                           LOIS (O.S.)\r\n               If I have to read one more vampire\r\n               story, I swear I'll drive a stake\r\n               through my own goddamn heart.\r\n\r\n     MANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages\r\n     splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly\r\n     follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now.\r\n\r\n     CAPTION: LOIS PIPER\r\n                                                               76.\r\n\r\n                           LOIS (CONT'D)\r\n               Vampires! Zombies!

Just shoot me now!\r\n\r\n     It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera.\r\n     Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck\r\n     over the assistant.\r\n\r\n                            COLETTE\r\n               Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper?\r\n\r\n     Lois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then--\r\n     magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl.\r\n     She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a\r\n     warm reception.\r\n\r\n     Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands\r\n     with Dr. Xiroman.\r\n\r\n                           LOIS\r\n               Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're\r\n               here.

Please\r\n               come in for a minute.\r\n\r\n     Another glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by\r\n     the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely\r\n     snubbing a bewildered Colette.\r\n\r\n                           LOIS (CONT'D)\r\n               My family talks about you all the\r\n               time. You were so helpful to my\r\n               sister. She's doing much better.\r\n\r\n     Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk\r\n     away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there!\r\n\r\n96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96\r\n\r\n     Lois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover\r\n     her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair.

I want you to get\r\n          this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE\r\nMANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor.\r\n\r\n                        LOIS (CONT'D)\r\n          Wheeeeee!\r\n\r\nColette looks aghast.

Nyet, Colette. Not Yet. But\r\n               soon.\r\n                                                                   79.\r\n\r\n99    EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT                                    99\r\n\r\n      Henry delivers another pizza. Pockets the money as he walks\r\n      back to his car, whistling. Checks his delivery list. Stares\r\n      at the next address in sudden disbelief.\r\n\r\n                              HENRY\r\n                Shit!\r\n\r\n100   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              100\r\n\r\n      Henry stands in the doorway, glumly clutching the PIZZA BOX.\r\n      Hesitates. Finally rings doorbell. Pause. Followed by LOUD\r\n      LAUGHTER. Door swings open. Richard stands there, wearing\r\n      only his jeans. His hair is a mess.\r\n\r\n                            RICHARD\r\n                You're late, Pizza Boy.\r\n\r\n      Richard finally notices the camera.\r\n\r\n                              RICHARD (CONT'D)\r\n                What the --\r\n\r\n                            HENRY\r\n                    (Overlapping)\r\n                They're with me. Your total comes to\r\n                nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.\r\n\r\n      Richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket. He\r\n      hands it to Henry. Then reconsiders, calling inside.\r\n\r\n                            RICHARD\r\n                Babe, I need a single.\r\n\r\n      No response.\r\n\r\n                            RICHARD (CONT'D)\r\n                C'mon, babe. Got a dollar for Pizza\r\n                Boy?\r\n\r\n                              WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n                Coming!\r\n\r\n      Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better\r\n      things to do. Off he goes.\r\n\r\n      Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt\r\n      and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.\r\n\r\n                              HANNAH\r\n                Here you--\r\n\r\n      Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry. Henry and Hannah\r\n      lock eyes for a long beat. Poor kid. This is the moment.\r\n                                                          80.\r\n\r\nReality smacks him in the face. Hard.\r\n\r\nHannah starts to hand Henry the money. He puts his hands up:\r\nNo thanks. Hannah doesn't press. Henry can't hold back any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          No distractions. The writing comes\r\n          first.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          He's making me a better writer.\r\n\r\n                        HENRY\r\n          Yeah.    I bet he is.\r\n\r\nQuietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY (CONT'D)\r\n          How much better are you, Hannah?\r\n          Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse\r\n          Five? D'ya know?\r\n\r\n                        HANNAH\r\n          Henry.    Don't.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          No, No. This could be quite\r\n          educational. How about Native Son?\r\n          Catch-22?\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Why isn't it enough that I'm your\r\n          friend?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's\r\n          Complaint? Do you know any author?\r\n          Harry Potter--You must know Harry\r\n          Potter.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          Why isn't it enough that I believe\r\n          in your writing?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          --Sophie's Choice? Anything published\r\n          in the English language.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH\r\n          --That I believe in you?\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          You didn't read Gatsby, did you?\r\n          Never even opened it, I bet.\r\n                                                                 81.\r\n\r\n      Enough.\r\n\r\n                              HANNAH\r\n                I'm not--\r\n\r\n      She hesitates.   Not for long.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n                I'm not the one delivering pizzas\r\n                for a living.\r\n\r\n      Score one for Hannah.\r\n\r\n                            HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n                I'm not the one wasting my talent.\r\n                You've read all those books, sure,\r\n                but my book is being published. Is\r\n                yours?\r\n\r\n      Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar\r\n      bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats\r\n      back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving\r\n      Henry alone.\r\n\r\n      Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441.\r\n\r\n101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101\r\n\r\n      We've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard\r\n      Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict\r\n      books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns\r\n      his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot\r\n      of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the\r\n      photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo\r\n      and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection\r\n      letters.\r\n\r\n      Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed\r\n      by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful,\r\n      rejection. It's over.\r\n\r\n      Henry understands what must be done. He goes over to his\r\n      desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at\r\n      Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on.\r\n\r\n      He contemplates for a second. Then begins typing.\r\n\r\n102   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    102\r\n\r\n      Sigrid's Wall of America has been taken down. A few nail\r\n      holes and tape marks are all that remain--except for the\r\n      single PHOTO of John still hanging in the center.\r\n                                                                   82.\r\n\r\n103   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      103\r\n\r\n      Back to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference.\r\n      Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a\r\n      softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN\r\n                 Well, Strudel shipped out.\r\n\r\n      A side glance to the empty chair.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n                 Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I\r\n                 didn't have time for a relationship.\r\n                 Not with my book selling like it is.\r\n                 She, well, she became collateral\r\n                 damage. Hated to end it. What a\r\n                 dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the\r\n                 smarts of my first wife. The body\r\n                 of my second wife. Thank god she\r\n                 wasn't anything like my third wife.\r\n                 I did the right thing. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      Good acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't\r\n      avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love\r\n      tap.\r\n\r\n104   INT.   JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    104\r\n\r\n      John packs COPIES OF HIS BOOK ever-so-carefully into an old\r\n      standard issue military DUFFEL BAG.\r\n\r\n                             JOHN (V.O.)\r\n                 What matters now is that the Roaring\r\n                 Lion book tour is about to begin.\r\n                 Can't wait to hit the road and meet\r\n                 the good people of this nation.\r\n                 Good American people.\r\n\r\n      John gazes over at his photo on the wall. Salutes himself.\r\n\r\n105   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               105\r\n\r\n      Meeting of the writing group. Not yet started. John, Alan,\r\n      and Hannah sit around the table. No refreshments being\r\n      served. No small talk. Everyone is quiet.\r\n\r\n      Hannah looks fantastic. More makeup. Nicer clothes. Fidgets\r\n      in her chair. Seems anxious. Stares at her new KINDLE.\r\n\r\n      FRONT DOOR opens and closes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. It's\r\n      Henry. Looks determined. Man on a mission. Carries a satchel.\r\n\r\n                             HENRY\r\n                 Sorry I'm late.\r\n                                                            83.\r\n\r\nJohn grunts something. Hannah remains quiet. Avoids eye\r\ncontact with Henry. Henry reaches into his satchel and pulls\r\nout stapled, typed pages. Multiple copies. Hands one to\r\neach of the three group members. Puts another down where\r\nColette will sit.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          Wutch you got here, Obert?\r\n\r\n                       HENRY\r\n          New pages.   I'm ready to read.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          Way to go, Henry.\r\n\r\nEven Hannah looks surprised. She and Alan thumb through their\r\ncopies. John sniffs at the front page. Henry slides in across\r\nfrom Hannah. Looks satisfied. FRONT DOOR opens again. MORE\r\nFOOTSTEPS. Colette arrives with Dr. Xiroman in tow. Xiroman?\r\nThe others exchange puzzled glances.\r\n\r\n                       JOHN\r\n          Christ.   What's he doing here?\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          I've invited Doctor Xiroman to join\r\n          our writing group.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          You must be joking, Colette.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          I am not joking. And, as a matter\r\n          of fact, I'll have all of you know\r\n          that the doctor and I are soon to be\r\n          published authors. We've signed with\r\n          The Lois Piper Agency.\r\n\r\nColette stands there, waiting for the applause and\r\ncongratulations, but all she receives is stunned silence.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          You can't do this.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Why not? With William gone, we have\r\n          an opening.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          Henry's right. We all have to agree\r\n          on new members.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          I don't care about your silly rules.\r\n                                                                84.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          I am the leader of the group--\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          --Oh, please.

She composes\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n                         HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm leaving.\r\n\r\nSurprise all around.    Hannah avoids looking at Henry.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          It's time. Richard is going to mentor\r\n          me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two\r\n          equals four and we all know four's...\r\n\r\nHer voice trails off.    Why bother explaining.   Just do it.\r\n\r\n                      HANNAH (CONT'D)\r\n          Anyway, I'm quitting.\r\n\r\nThere. She said it. Hannah looks so relieved. She's done.\r\nIndignant, Colette stares her up and down.\r\n                                                            85.\r\n\r\nPoints to Dr.    Xiroman.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          Well, in this case one plus one equals\r\n          one very successful writing team. I\r\n          can't believe you, Hannah. You're\r\n          doing this just to upstage our news\r\n          about landing an agent.\r\n\r\n                        ALAN\r\n          Stop it...\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          No, this is what it's all about.\r\n          The spotlight always has to be on\r\n          Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her\r\n          book deal. Her movie deal.\r\n\r\nJohn shoots to his feet.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          News flash for you all. John K.\r\n          Butzin is also saying Sayonara.\r\n          Heading off on my international book\r\n          tour.\r\n\r\n                      HENRY\r\n          International?\r\n\r\n                      JOHN\r\n          Damn straight. Tijuana.\r\n              (Beat)\r\n          I'm done with you pussies.\r\n\r\nJohn snatches up his folder and marches out of the house.\r\nSilence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions\r\nfor Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares\r\ndirectly at Colette.\r\n\r\n                        ALAN\r\n          Get out.    Now.\r\n\r\nColette can't believe what she's hearing.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n          As the leader of this writing group,\r\n          I've determined your actions are\r\n          contrary to our stated purpose. Get\r\n          out.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          You can't kick me out.    I live here.\r\n\r\nShe's right.    Alan considers his options.\r\n                                                               86.\r\n\r\n                       ALAN\r\n          Fine.   Then go to your room.\r\n\r\nPoints to Xiroman.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN (CONT'D)\r\n          And take him with you. Won't be the\r\n          first guy.\r\n\r\nAlan means business.   Colette stands up straight.   Gathers\r\nup her materials.\r\n\r\n                      COLETTE\r\n          We'll certainly have plenty to discuss\r\n          in therapy.\r\n\r\n                      ALAN\r\n          Go by yourself.
