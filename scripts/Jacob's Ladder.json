VIETNAM - DUSK\n\nA swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army \nof men over a Vietnamese hillside.\n\nThe SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection \nof the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants, \nseventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a \nsweltering wilderness.\n\nIt is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle \nclose to the ground smoking a joint.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tStrong stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\t\t(to JACOB, a soldier\n\t\t\tsquatting several yards\n\t\t\taway)\n\t\tHey, Professor, how many times can\n\t\tyou shit in an hour?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tDon't bug 'im.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tWhere are those gooks already?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tSome offensive. I don't even think\n\t\tthey're out there.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tJesus, this grass is something else.\n\nJACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tWhy even bother to pull 'em up?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou jackin' off out there again, huh\n\t\tJake?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tHey, get off his back.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tIt's called philosophizing, right\n\t\tProfessor?\n\nJACOB gives them the finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tUp yours, you adolescent scum.\n\nLaughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT (V.O.)\n\t\tMount your bayonets.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(frightened)\n\t\tOh shit!\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tGoddam!\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tGimme that joint!\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tHey, something's wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tMy head.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tIt's nerves. Take another toke.\n\nGEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to \nthe ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back, \nstartled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his \nchattering teeth.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tWhat's going on?\n\nBefore anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns \nfrantically in all directions.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tHelp me! Help me!\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tWhat the hell ... ?\n\nIn seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking \ninto a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck. \nFRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He \nbegins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as \nhe gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN \nwatch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all-\nout panic.\n\nSuddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without \nwarning, attacks the MEN around him.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tGod Almighty!\n\nPAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB \njumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes \nto his assistance.\n\nJACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the \nface of a madman.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tGood God! What's happening?\n\nThe sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting \nbehind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening \nsky.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tBehind you! Look out! This is it!\n\nThe MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB \nalone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers \nhis strength.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't leave me.\n\nDark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. \nSOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tThey're coming!\n\nGunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He begins \nscreaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. FRANK is \nstruggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to \nrestrain him. Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. Bodies fall. \nMore bodies keep coming. The first wave is upon them.\n\nROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like \nbanshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of \nhis attacker. Agonizing cries accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet \nout and stabs again.\n\nIn the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the \nbutt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a cracking sound. JACOB's \neyes freeze with pain. His hands rush for his spine. As he spins around \none of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into \nJACOB's stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.\n\n\nCUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark \ntunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a \nbrilliant light. The rush suggests a passage between life and death, \nbut as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through \na SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK.\n\n\nINT.  SUBWAY - NIGHT\n\nTHE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station. JACOB \nSINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The sounds of the \nscream and the grating wheels merge. He is dazed and confused, not \ncertain where he is.\n\nJACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to overhead \nadvertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. Gradually \nhis confusion subsides. Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book \nout of his back pocket, \"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus. He begins \nreading. Another station blurs by.\n\nJACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is in his mid-\nthirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. He \ndoesn't look like one.\n\nThe subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is restless and \nconcerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30 A.M. Putting his book in \nhis back pocket, JACOB stands up and makes his way through the deserted \ncar.\n\n\nINT.  SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT\n\nJACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The wheels spark \nagainst the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash by. He pulls the handle \non the door to the next car. It is stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY \nsitting alone inside turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his \neffort. He motions for her to help. She turns away.\n\nA look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door. It slides \nopen. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tExcuse me, do you know if we've\n\t\tpassed Nostrand Avenue yet?\n\t\t\t(she doesn't answer)\n\t\tExcuse me.\n\t\t\t(she does not\n\t\t\tacknowledge his\n\t\t\texistence)\n\t\tLook, I'm asking a simple question.\n\t\tHave we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell\n\t\tasleep.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(speaking with a Puerto\n\t\t\tRican accent)\n\t\tI no from around here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(glad for a response)\n\t\tYeah, you and everyone else.\n\nJACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The only other \npassenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the fiberglass bench. \nOccasionally his body shudders. It is the only sign of life in him.\n\nThe train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the window. Nostrand \nAvenue signs appear. He is relieved. He gets up and grabs hold of the \noverhead bar.\n\nThe OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he adjusts his \nposition, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a brief glimpse of \nsomething protruding from beneath the coat's hem. His eyes fixate on \nthe spot, waiting for another look. There is a slight movement and it \nappears - a long, red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends \nshivers up JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the \nstopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.\n\n\nINT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nJACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close quickly behind \nhim. He glances at the LADY sitting by the window. There is a fearful \nexpression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark \ntunnel, out of his sight.\n\nJACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor \nto ceiling gates. He is about to push when he notices a chain locking \nit shut. He stares at it in disbelief.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddam it.\n\nHe turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. As he \napproaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The gate there is also locked. \nHis hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.\n\nCUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the \ntracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo way!\n\nHe starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere \nelse to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.\n\nJACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where he is \nstepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace. \nThe steel girders are coated in subway grime. The oily substance coats \nhis hands as he reaches for support.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddam fucking city!\n\nHe wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center \ntrack. He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. Two \npinpoints of light hurl toward him. Then the noise arrives confirming \nhis fear. A train is bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not \nsure which way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He \ncannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at phenomenal \nspeed. The station is spinning. The train's lights merge into one \nbrilliant intensity.\n\nIn near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by. Its \nvelocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. He \nclings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths.\n\nA few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their faces, pressed \nup against the glass, seem deformed. A lone figure waves at him from \nthe rear window. The train bears them all away. Then it is quiet again. \nFor a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. \nHe continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder \nto the UPTOWN PLATFORM.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nJACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. This \nexit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. JACOB \nstares at it with an expression of total bewilderment.\n\nA sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone. His head \nturns but sees no one. He hears the scream again. He senses its \ndirection and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A crack of light appears \nunder the door. He can hear someone moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly \nand the moaning stops. The lights click off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHey, is someone in there?\n\nThere is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not sure what \nto do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower lip nervously and \nthen reaches for the door. It pushes open.\n\nThe light from the station penetrates the darkness. He gasps. He sees a \nMAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for \nhis clothes. The BOUND MAN screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOUND MAN\n\t\tFuck off! Mind your own business!\n\nA THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at JACOB's \nthroat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tYou cocksucker! Get outta here.\n\nThe MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react the door \nslams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light reappears. JACOB can \nhear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. He backs away \nfrom the door. His face is white.\n\nJACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain gives wayto \nhis anger. It flies apart and the gate flings open. He stands in \namazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and \ndrops to the concrete below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it \naside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.\n\n\nEXT.  WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN\n\nJACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING \nPROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic \nstructures. JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the \nimposing shapes. Aside from his moving body everything is still.\n\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - DAWN\n\nJACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal \nhallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN\n\nJACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to \nnavigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in \nthe distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table. \nA WOMAN\"s voice calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tJake, is that you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the hell did you do, move all\n\t\tthe furniture?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tWhy didn't you turn on the light?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI didn't want to wake you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(sleepy but pleasant)\n\t\tGee, thanks a lot.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere is the lamp?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tWhere are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIf I knew I wouldn't have to ask.\n\t\tWhat did you do? I was happy the way\n\t\tit was.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tI moved the couch. That's all.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere to?\n\nJACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL \"JEZZIE\" \nPIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth \nbathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking \nher best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and \nsensual.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThat help?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(nearly sprawled over\n\t\t\tthe couch)\n\t\tThanks.\n\nHe pushes himself up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThe room!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come\n\t\tyou're so late?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tRoberts didn't show up. What could I\n\t\tsay? Besides, it's double time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(seeing the grease on\n\t\t\this uniform)\n\t\tWhat happened to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(unbuttoning his shirt\n\t\t\tas he walks to the\n\t\t\tBATHROOM)\n\t\tDon't ask.\n\nJACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in \na pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of \nwater pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's \nnakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his \nnipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter \nthe shower together.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nA DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is \ncrawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is \nbloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left \narm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHelp me. Someone.\n\nSuddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances \naround the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to \nsee who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is \nlying and then bursts directly into his eyes.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY\n\nSUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully \nas a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and \nprotect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake.\n\nJACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes \nalong the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He \nhas trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the \nheadboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He \nsits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus \nshelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou up?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. Have you seen my glasses?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(shaking her head)\n\t\tWhere'd you leave 'em?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tDid you look around the headboard?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(wearily)\n\t\tJezzie, I can't see.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(she scans the shelf)\n\t\tMaybe you left 'em in the bathroom.\n\nShe leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper \nbag. She tosses them both onto the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThanks.\n\t\t\t(he puts on his glasses\n\t\t\tand notices the bag)\n\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYour kid dropped it off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho? Jed?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(stooping to pick up the\n\t\t\tphone)\n\t\tNo. The little one.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tEli. Why can't you remember their\n\t\tnames?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThey're weird names.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThey're Biblical. They were prophets.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWell, personally, I never went for\n\t\tchurch names.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAnd where do you think Jezebel comes\n\t\tfrom?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI don't let anybody call me that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tYou're a real heathen, you know that,\n\t\tJezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get\n\t\tinvolved with such a ninny?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou sold your soul, remember? That's\n\t\twhat you told me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYeah, but for what?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tA good lay.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAnd look what I got.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThe best.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI must have been out of my head.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake, you are never out of your head!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(ignoring the criticism\n\t\t\tand reaching for the\n\t\t\tpaper bag)\n\t\tWhat's in here?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tPictures. Your wife was gonna toss\n\t\t'em so \"what's his name\" brought 'em\n\t\tover on his way to school.\n\nJACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed. There are \nhundreds of them. He examines them with growing delight.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLook at these, will ya? I don't\n\t\tbelieve it. Jesus, these are\n\t\tfantastic. Look, here's my Dad ...\n\t\tAnd here's my brother, when we were\n\t\tdown in Florida.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tLemme see.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(rummaging excitedly\n\t\t\tthrough the pile)\n\t\tHere. Look. This is me and Sarah when\n\t\tI was still at City College.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(looking closely)\n\t\tThat's Sarah?\n\t\t\t(she studies the photo)\n\t\tI can see what you mean.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhy you left.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat do you mean you can see?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tLook at her face. A real bitch.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe looked good then.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tNot to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWell, you didn't marry her.\n\nHe digs through more photos. Suddenly he stops.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\nTo JEZZIE's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes. For a \nmoment JACOB is unable to speak. He just stares at one of the photos. \nJEZZIE looks at the picture. It is an image of JACOB carrying a small \nchild on his shoulders.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIs that the one who died?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tGabe.\n\nJEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSorry. it just took me by surprise. I\n\t\tdidn't expect to see him this morning\n\t\t... God, what I wouldn't ... He was\n\t\tthe cutest little guy. Like an angel,\n\t\tyou know. He had this smile ...\n\t\t\t(choking up again)\n\t\tFuck, I don't even remember this\n\t\tpicture.\n\nHiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and reaches for a \npair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the \nphoto of GABE inside. It joins photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE \nbegins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWait. Don't.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI don't like things that make you\n\t\tcry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI just want to look ...\n\nHe reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an array of frozen \nmoments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly he stops and stares at a \nyellowing snapshot.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGod, this is me!\n\t\t\t(he holds up a baby\n\t\t\tphoto)\n\t\tLook. It's dated right after I was\n\t\tborn.\n\t\t\t(he stares at it\n\t\t\tintently)\n\t\tWhat a kid. Cute, huh? So much\n\t\tpromise.\n\nJEZZIE surveys the scene.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole\n\t\tlife ... right in front of you.\n\t\t\t(she pauses before\n\t\t\tmaking her final\n\t\t\tpronouncement)\n\t\tWhat a mess!\n\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - DAY\n\nJEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the hall. She is \ncarrying several bags. Two of them are tossed instantly down the chute. \nShe hesitates with the third. After a moment she reaches into it and \npulls out a handful of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH. \nWith cool deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment door \nslams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand. \nJACOB opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the \nmemories of his life falls to the fire below.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tReady?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJust gettin' rid of the garbage.\n\nJACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the ELEVATOR. \nThey are surprised that it has arrived promptly. JEZZIE reaches out and \nplayfully sticks her tongue into JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the \nELEVATOR. They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors.\n\n\nEXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY\n\nJACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown \nManhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al \nJolson's \"Sonny Boy.\"\n\nJACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He \nopens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts \nthem with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He \nconsiders giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns \ninstead and waddles toward the store.\n\n\nINT.  LAUNDRY - DAY\n\nA heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered \nwith laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall. \nShe looks at JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tWhere do you expect me to put those?\n\t\tI don't have any room.\n\nShe tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHow 'bout over there?\n\t\t\t(she points to a table)\n\t\tNo wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to\n\t\tthe back room.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThey're awfully heavy.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tI know. That's why I'm asking.\n\nJACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE \nLAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing \nmachines shoots into the air.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(huffing and puffing)\n\t\tWhere's Wong?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tThat's what I'd like to know. If you\n\t\tsee him on the street somewhere, tell\n\t\thim he's fired.\n\nJACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound \nand he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers \nfor the WOMAN's signature.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow was Palm Springs?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tHot. Where do I sign?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(pointing to the line)\n\t\tYou got a nice tan, though.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tTan? What tan? It faded on the\n\t\tairplane. I'd try to get my money\n\t\tback, but who do you ask?\n\t\t\t(she looks heavenward)\n\t\tTwo hundred dollars a night, for\n\t\twhat?\n\nShe hands JACOB the wrong sheet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. I'll take the other one.\n\t\t\t(he takes it)\n\t\tRight. Well it's good to have you\n\t\tback. See you tomorrow, probably.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tIf you're lucky.\n\nJACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His \nback is out.\n\n\nINT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY\n\nANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are \nblaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying \non top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move. \nCurious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from \nbeneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps \nback, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at \nan old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is \ncovered in strange bumps.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it! What the hell ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tWINO\n\t\t\t(pleading)\n\t\tI didn't take nothin'. I was just\n\t\tnapping. Don't hit me. I was cold.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(lifting the man up)\n\t\tWhat the hell do you think you're\n\t\tdoing? You can't do this. This is\n\t\tgovernment property.\n\nHe begins opening the door. The WINO begs.\n\n\t\t\t\tWINO\n\t\tDon't throw me out. They're gonna get\n\t\tme. They'll tear me to pieces.\n\nHe holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tCome on. You can't stay here.\n\n\t\t\t\tWINO\n\t\tPlease! I never hurt anybody when I\n\t\twas alive. Believe me. I don't belong\n\t\there.\n\nJACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the \ntruck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he \nleads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his \npocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a \nball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB \nreturns to the truck shaking his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNew York!\n\nHe climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He \nnotices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn \nhonks and traffic begins moving. When JACOB looks back the WINO is no \nlonger there.\n\n\nINT.  GARAGE - DAY\n\nJACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on \n34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking.\n\n\nINT.  POST OFFICE - DAY\n\nWe see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving \nmail.\n\nJACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through \nthe aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him \nand grab for his french fries. He offers them around.\n\nANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting \nmistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow's it going?\n\nShe takes the hamburger and shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI'm going home.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know. One of these days, I'm\n\t\tgonna see Louis. My back's killing\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tNow? What about the boss? He's not\n\t\tgonna like it.\n\nJACOB shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, I'll miss riding home with you.\n\t\tI was looking forward to it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'll be glad to avoid the crush.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI enjoy crushing into you.\n\nShe grabs him and hugs him tightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGently. My back.\n\nJEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.\n\n\nINT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY\n\nCUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is lying on a \nlong leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture. \nLOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant of a man, 280 pounds. He is \nadjusting JACOB's spine.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tCome on, Jake. That didn't hurt.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow do you know?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tI know you. How come you're so tense\n\t\ttoday?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat can I tell you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tI saw Sarah the other day.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHer knee acting up?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tA bit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat did she have to say?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tTurn on your right side.\n\t\t\t(he turns on his left)\n\t\tHow about the other \"right?\"\n\t\t\t(JACOB turns back)\n\t\tI don't understand you philosphers.\n\t\tYou've got the whole world figured\n\t\tout but you can't remember the\n\t\tdifference between right and left.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI was absent the day they taught that\n\t\tin school. What did she say?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWho?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSarah.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tNot much. She's like you that way.\n\t\tTwo clams. No wonder your marriage\n\t\tdidn't last. Put your hand under your\n\t\thead. Take a breath and then let it\n\t\tout.\n\nHe makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh. JACOB \ngroans.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAh, good. Now turn to your left.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe talk about the boys?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tShe says she can't get them new coats\n\t\tbecause you haven't sent the alimony\n\t\tfor three months.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe told you that?\n\t\t\t(he shakes his head)\n\t\tDid she tell you about the $2,000 I'm\n\t\tstill paying for the orthodontist?\n\t\tI'll bet she didn't mention that.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tShe said you were a son of a bitch\n\t\tand she regrets the day she set eyes\n\t\ton you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI thought you said she didn't say\n\t\tmuch.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tShe didn't. That's about all she\n\t\tsaid. Put your hand up. Good. I think\n\t\tshe still loves you. Take a breath\n\t\tand let it out.\n\nHe makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLoves me!? She hasn't said a kind\n\t\tword about me in years!\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tRight. She doesn't stop talking about\n\t\tyou. You're always on her mind.\n\t\tThat's love, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe hates me, Louis.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tYou should go back to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat? She threw me out, remember. She\n\t\twanted some professor to carry her\n\t\tfar away from Brooklyn. Only we\n\t\tdidn't make it. She can't forgive me\n\t\tthat she still lives in the same\n\t\thouse she grew up in.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tHer problem is that you spent eight\n\t\tyears getting a PhD and then went to\n\t\twork for the post office.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat can I tell you, Louis? After Nam\n\t\tI didn't want to think anymore. I\n\t\tdecided my brain was too small an\n\t\torgan to comprehend this chaos.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(looking at JACOB with\n\t\t\taffection)\n\t\tIf it was any other brain but yours,\n\t\tI might agree. Relax, this is going\n\t\tto be strong.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI can't relax.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWiggle your toes.\n\nJACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck \nrapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nTHERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tI found one. He's alive.\n\nHe shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos.\n\n\nCHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY\n\nSuddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGod almighty. What did you do to me?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tI had to get in there. A deep\n\t\tadjustment. Rest a moment and let it\n\t\tset a bit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI had this weird flash just then.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know. I've been having them\n\t\trecently.\n\t\t\t(he thinks a moment,\n\t\t\tthen changes the\n\t\t\tsubject)\n\t\tYou know, you look like an angel,\n\t\tLouis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone\n\t\tever tell you that?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tYeah. You. Every time I see you. No\n\t\tmore Errol Flynn, okay? Your back\n\t\twon't take it. You tell your girl\n\t\tfriend to calm down if she knows\n\t\twhat's good for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLouis, you're a life saver.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tI know.\n\n\nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING\n\nJACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and \nimitating Al Jolson.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhen there are gray skies, I don't\n\t\tmind the gray skies, as long as\n\t\tthere's you ...\n\nHe hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop \nwindows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are \ndressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic \nappearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations.\n\nThe ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous.\n\nJACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug \nstore. They chortle and make taunting sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\t\t(shaking her tits,\n\t\t\tsinging)\n\t\t\"Hey, Mr. Postman ... \"\n\nJACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing \nwith them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment.\n\nJACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is \ngreen. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR \nsharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading \nstraight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tLook out!\n\nJACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves \nin his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tJump!\n\nWith a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots \nby. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing \nlike madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB \nyells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to \nthank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK\n\nJACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even \nin quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic \nand stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped \nbehind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is \nlying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head \nis propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet \nscar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the \nblue, JEZZIE speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tMaybe it's all the pressure, Jake.\n\t\tThe money. Things like that. Or your\n\t\twife.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy do you bring her up?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t'Cause she's always on your mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhen was the last time I said a word?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt has nothin' to do with talkin'.\n\nShe pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is \nover. Then she continues.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOr maybe it's the war.\n\nJACOB closes his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIt's still there, Jake.\n\t\t\t(she points to his\n\t\t\tbrain)\n\t\tEven if you never say a word about\n\t\tit. You can't spend two years in\n\t\tVietnam ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tWhat does that have to do with\n\t\tanything? Does it explain the\n\t\tbarricaded subway stations? Does it\n\t\texplain those Godforsaken creatures?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tNew York is filled with creatures.\n\t\tEverywhere. And lots of stations are\n\t\tclosed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThey're like demons, Jez.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tDemons, Jake? Come on. They're winos\n\t\tand bag ladies. Low life. That's all\n\t\tthey are. The streets are crawling\n\t\twith 'em. Don't make em into\n\t\tsomethin' they're not.\n\t\t\t(she rubs his forehead)\n\t\tIt's the pressure, honey. That's all\n\t\tit is.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThose guys tried to kill me tonight.\n\t\tThey were aiming right at me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tKids on a joy ride. Happens all the\n\t\ttime.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThey weren't human!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tCome on. What were they, Jake?\n\nJACOB doesn't answer. He turns over on his stomach. JEZZIE stares at \nhis naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks. Scratch \nmarks follow in their wake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou still love me?\n\nHe does not respond.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\nJACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE is reading \nthe National Enquirer and chewing at her lip. Suddenly a drop of blood \nforms and falls onto the formica table top. Staring at it for a moment, \nshe wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue.\n\nJACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the \nhousing project across the way. The toaster pops. JEZZIE jumps. She \ngets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSays here the world's comin' to an\n\t\tend. The battle of heaven and hell\n\t\tthey call it. Should be quite a show;\n\t\tfireworks, H-bombs, and everything.\n\t\tYou believe them, Jake?\n\nJACOB doesn't answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tMe neither ... God, look at this. Two\n\t\theads. Only lived two days. A day for\n\t\teach head. Could you imagine me with\n\t\ttwo heads? We'd probably keep each\n\t\tother up all night - arguing and\n\t\twhatnot. You wanna see the picture?\n\nHe does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB. Standing \nin front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart. She \nis naked underneath it. Sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his \nshirt, and strokes his chest. She waits for a response from him, but \nthere is none. He sits silently, disinterested.\n\nFurious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom \ncloset she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on. Breasts flash \nfrom beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the \nfloor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGoddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My\n\t\tuncle's dogs used to treat me better\n\t\tthan you do. At least they'd lick my\n\t\ttoes once in a while. At least they\n\t\tshowed some fucking interest.\n\nA NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tAll right! All right! All right!\n\nJACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the \npatterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures drift purposefully \nover the concrete.\n\nSuddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB realizes \nthat JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen \ntable. He walks to her side and strokes her hair. JEZZIE begins to sob. \nAfter a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou love me?\n\nHe nods his head \"yes.\" She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a \nkitten against his crotch. After a few moments she speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDella's party's tonight. Why don't we\n\t\tgo? It'll take your minf offa things.\n\t\tAnd I won't make you dance. I\n\t\tpromise. Huh?\n\t\t\t(he nods his head in\n\t\t\tconsent. JEZZIE hugs\n\t\t\thim)\n\t\tYou still love me, Jake?\n\nHe nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts \nhim.\n\n\nINT.  BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nJACOB is in the \"Mental Health Clinic\" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL walking \nthrough the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is overflowing with people. \nSome are handcuffed to their chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB \napproaches the main RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,\n\t\tplease.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tCarlson? Is he new here?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNew? He's been here for years.\n\nShe shrugs and looks at a log book.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tNot according to my charts. Do you\n\t\thave an appointment?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tLook, I need to see him. I know where\n\t\this room is. Just give me a pass. I\n\t\twon't be long. Ten minutes.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tOur doctors are seen by appointment\n\t\tonly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDamn it. I was in the veteran's out-\n\t\tpatient program. He knows me.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\t\t(not happy)\n\t\tWhat's your name?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJacob Singer.\n\nShe walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times \nbefore coming back over to JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tI'm sorry but there's no record of a\n\t\tJacob Singer in our files.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhataya mean, no record?\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tYou want me to spell it out? There's\n\t\tnothing here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThat's ridiculous. I've been coming\n\t\there for years. Listen to me. I'm\n\t\tgoing out of my fucking mind here. I\n\t\tneed to see him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tIf this is an emergency we have a\n\t\tstaff of psychiatric social workers.\n\t\tThere's about an hour's wait. I'll be\n\t\tglad to take your name. Why don't you\n\t\tjust fill out this form?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it! I don't want a social\n\t\tworker. Carlson knows me.\n\nJACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the \nRECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts angrily and stoops to \nretrieve them. Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off. \nTWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS protrude from her skull where the cap had been. \nJACOB's eyes lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately \nreplaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with \ndemonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the \"In \nPatient\" door.\n\n\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\t\tHey! You can't go in there!\n\nJACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him.\n\n\nJACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution. \nA LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall. \nThey break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT \ntries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their \nhysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tLET GO! GET AWAY!\n\n\nINT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY\n\nJACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor, wildly \nsearching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes inside. He is \nsurprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle. They all \nlook up at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER\n\t\tCan I help you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't\n\t\tthis his office?\n\nThe LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he gets up and \ntakes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone is watching them. The \nLEADER speaks quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER\n\t\tI'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't\n\t\t... Dr. Carlson died.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tDied?\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER\n\t\tA car accident.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJesus, Jesus! ...

They say it blew up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(growing pale)\n\t\tBlew up? What do you mean it blew up?\n\nThe LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls \naway.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER\n\t\tDo you want me to get someone?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. No. It's okay. I'm okay.\n\nHe backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all \nof the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently.\n\n\nUnsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and \nconfused. Suddenly a voice calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tHEY YOU! MAILMAN!\n\nJACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tHold it. Just hold it. Where the hell\n\t\tdo you think you are? This is\n\t\tBellevue, for God's sake. People\n\t\trunning around here get shot.\n\nThe GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the \nPOLICEMAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEADER\n\t\tIt's alright. He's okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\t\t(nodding, reholstering\n\t\t\this gun)\n\t\tCome on, get out of here. I wouldn't\n\t\twant to interfere with the U.S. Mail.\n\nHe leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.\n\n\nINT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nWE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some \nPOST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK \nis telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same \ntime. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on \nit. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to \njoin her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they \"get \nit,\" takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying \nto re-explain the joke.\n\nJACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming \nfrom a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The \nBIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound, \nloud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover.\n\nIn the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an \nattractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls \nover the music.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tHey, you! Let me look at your hand!\n\nJACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\tGo on Jake. She reads 'em like a\n\t\tbook.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo, thanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\tIt's fun.\n\nCUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and \nexamining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face \nturns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the \ntwo of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene \njealously.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tYou have an unusual hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI could have told you that.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tYou see this line here? It's your\n\t\tlife line. Here's where you were\n\t\tborn. And this is where you got\n\t\tmarried. You're a married man, huh?\n\t\tOh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.\n\nShe studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get \nJACOB's attention. He ignores her.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know, you got a strange line\n\t\there.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(examining it)\n\t\tIt's short, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tShort? It's ended.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\tOh, terrific.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tIt's not funny. According to this ...\n\t\tyou're already dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tJust my luck.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nTHE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser. The music is \nstrong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and \ngives them a strange, distorted appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from \nthe crowd and reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE \nDANCERS call out to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANCERS\n\t\tCome on man, show your stuff.\n\nJACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE and nods \napologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his \ninadequacy on the dance floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tCome on professor. You got feet, too.\n\nJACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing. JEZZIE is \nplaying with him, mimicking his movement. A number of DANCERS notice \nand laugh, which only increases his discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a \nstrange effect on JACOB. He grows distant and withdrawn, even though \nhis body is still going through the motions of the dance.\n\nA MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around, smiling, and \nbegins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone, dancing by himself. He \nlooks away, uncomfortable.\n\nIn the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems to be \nurinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several DANCERS obscure his \nview. He turns around.\n\nA PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB cannot believe \nwhat he sees.\n\nIn the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying image, a MAN \nwhose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has \nlost all definition. Something about the image compels and frightens \nJACOB. Slowly he approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured \nimage lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that JACOB \nbacks away.\n\nA WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins dancing \nwith him. He is totally disoriented.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tHold me, baby!\n\nShe takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA follows his \nhand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting \ndress. He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades. Then, suddenly, \nhe recoils. Her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, \nbony protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into him \nand wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled, jerks his head and \nhis glasses go flying to the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShit!\n\nHe stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his fingers as \nhe digs between dancing legs trying to recover them. Miraculously, he \ngrabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back \non. Instantly his world comes back into focus.\n\nAs he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him, gyrating in \nwild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile on her face. She grabs \nhis hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is \ndancing to her own rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him \na moment to realize that her smile is not for him.\n\nStanding behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around her waist. \nThey are moving together, locked in erotic embrace. It appears that he \nis mounting her from behind. Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet \nare deformed. They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much \nlike hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.\n\nSomething horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back. We cannot \nmake out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror. Before JACOB can \nreact, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With a roaring sound, a spiked horn \nerupts from her throat. It juts menacingly from between her teeth and \nthrusts into the air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited \napproval.\n\nCUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at \nthe DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have become perverse, \ncorrupt aspects of their normal selves.\n\nJACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head \nbut it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic, \nalmost delirious.\n\nJACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism, a \ndesperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. WE MOVE \nIN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT \nfade away.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nStrange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a \nbright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud. The faces are looking \ndown and voices are speaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe's burning up.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTotal delirium.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's some gash. His guts keep\n\t\tspilling out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tPush 'em back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB (V.O.)\n\t\tHelp me!\n\nHis eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it filling the \nsky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a \nquickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush \ncauses them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost \nsensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.\n\nMusic can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a \nheart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic \nflashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The \nmusic grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.\n\n\nINT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nThe APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign is still \nflashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling and sweating.\n\nCheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB barely \nhears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him on the back.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRER\n\t\tYou are out of your mind, man. Out of\n\t\tyour fuckin' mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tJake, you little devil. You never\n\t\ttold me you could dance like that.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tJezzie, what did you put in his\n\t\tdrink?\n\nJEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair. He plops down. His \nchest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach. Hie face is \nfrightened and distorted.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI wanna leave. Get me out of here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tOh, come on. It's early.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(pulling JEZZIE close to\n\t\t\thim, his voice filled\n\t\t\twith paranoia)\n\t\tWhere are we?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(surprised by the\n\t\t\tquestion)\n\t\tWe're at Della's.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat do you mean? Where do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere's Della? Bring her here?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhy? What for?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShow me Della!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(confused)\n\t\tHey, I'm here.\n\nJACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and \ncrosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his \nstomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\tHiya Jake. That was some dance.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(staring at her closely)\n\t\tDella?\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\t\t(feeling the\n\t\t\tstrangeness)\n\t\tYou want to see me? Well, here I am.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI see.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\tWhat do you want?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJust to see you. That's all.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\t\t(a bit uncomfortable)\n\t\tWell, how do I look?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLike Della.\n\nSuddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking. His \nentire body is convulsive.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tAre you feeling all right? Shit,\n\t\tyou're burning up. Feel his forehead.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\t\t(checking his forehead\n\t\t\tand cheeks)\n\t\tDamn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI think you should lie down.\n\nJACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering around.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCan't you stop it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIf I could stop it, I'd stop it.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tIs he sick?\n\n\t\t\t\tDELLA\n\t\tHe's on fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tELSA\n\t\tLet me help you.\n\nShe reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet \nlike a wild man. He begins to scream.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tStay away from me! Don't you come\n\t\tnear me! All of you. Go to hell! Go\n\t\tto hell, goddamn you! Stay away!\n\nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look. A MAN \nwhispers to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tI'll call a cab.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nJACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his \nmouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI've never been so mortified in my\n\t\twhole life. Never! Screaming like\n\t\tthat. I don't understand what's\n\t\tgotten into you, Jake, to make you do\n\t\ta thing like that. You're not acting\n\t\tnormal. I've lived with too many\n\t\tcrazies in my life. I don't want it\n\t\tanymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired\n\t\tof men flipping out on me. Shit,\n\t\tyou'd think it was my fault. Well you\n\t\tpicked me, remember that. I don't\n\t\tneed this.\n\nThe NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAll right! All right!\n\nJEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIf you go crazy on me you're goin'\n\t\tcrazy by yourself. You understand?\n\nJEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. She looks \nat it closely and then squints to see it better.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's it say? A hundred and two?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI don't believe this. I'm calling the\n\t\tdoctor.\n\nShe runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat does it say?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tIt's gone to the top.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow high is that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tThe numbers stop at 107.\n\nJEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room.\n\nJACOB begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the \nfoot of the bed. He pulls it up around his shoulders. The whole bed \nvibrates with his shivering. Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the BEDROOM \nand into the BATHROOM. SHe turns on the bath water.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the hell are you doin'?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tGet your clothes off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat are you talking about? I'm\n\t\tfreezing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tGet your clothes off!\n\nJACOB gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the KITCHEN.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat'd the doctor say?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tThat you'd die on the way to the\n\t\thospital. Now get into that tub.\n\nJACOB stares at her as she bursts back into the BEDROOM carrying four \ntrays of ice cubes. She hurries into the BATHROOM and dumps them in the \ntub.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tHe's coming right over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tComing here?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n\t\tGoddamn it. Get in here. I can't\n\t\tstand around waiting.\n\nShe rushes out of the BATHROOM and pulls JACOB out of bed. He is \nshaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and \nundressing him at the same time. She maneuvers him into the BATHROOM \nnext to the tub. He looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou're out of your mind. I'm not\n\t\tgetting in there. I'd rather die.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThat's your decision.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLook at me. I'm ice cold.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou're red hot, damn it. Get in\n\t\tthere. I've got to get more ice.\n\nShe runs out of the room. The door to the apartment slams shut. JACOB \nsticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh Jesus!\n\nHe sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water \nturns his foot bright red. He keeps it in as long as he can and then \nyanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a towel. JACOB rubs his foot \nvigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of \nits pain.\n\n\nINT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nJEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors and \ncollecting ice cubes from those who will answer. She hurries back to \nthe BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her carrying additional ice \ntrays. One of the MEN is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the \nburning cold.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S BATHROOM\n\nAs JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM, JACOB is sitting on the rim of the tub \nwith the water up to his calves, shivering vigorously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI can't do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat kind of man are you?\n\nShe unloads two trays into the water.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't gimme that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tLie down!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(pleading)\n\t\tJezzie!

TONY \nwinces when the water hits his arm. JACOB nearly flies out of the tub. \nThe TWO MEN fight to hold him down. JACOB screams and cries for the MEN \nto let him go but they keep him flat on his back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI'm freezing! I'm freezing! Goddamn\n\t\tyou!\n\n\t\t\t\tTONY\n\t\t\t(his hand turning red)\n\t\tSam, I can't take it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tDon't you let go.\n\n\t\t\t\tTONY\n\t\tJez, get help.

They're heavy.\n\nTONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God! You're killing me! Stop!\n\n\nINT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing \nand turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he \nsits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is \nflapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDamn! You and your fresh air.\n\nHe jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame \nand it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up. \nIt is SARAH.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's freezing.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tI'm not cold.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOf course not. You have all the\n\t\tblankets. It must be ten degrees in\n\t\there. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you\n\t\twant to sleep with fresh air, you\n\t\tsleep on the fire escape. From now on\n\t\tthat window is closed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tIt's not healthy with it closed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThis is healthy? I'll probably die of\n\t\tpneumonia tomorrow and this is\n\t\thealthy.\n\nHe settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He \nlies quietly for a moment, thinking.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat a dream I was having. I was\n\t\tliving with another woman ... You\n\t\tknow who it was?\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tI don't want to know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJezebel, from the post office. You\n\t\tremember, you met her that time at\n\t\tthe Christmas party. I was living\n\t\twith her. God, it was a nightmare.\n\t\tThere were all these demons and I was\n\t\ton fire. Only I was burning from ice.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tGuilty thoughts. See what happens\n\t\twhen you cheat on me, even in your\n\t\tmind?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe was good in bed, though.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tGo to sleep.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShe had these real beefy thighs.\n\t\tDelicious.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tI thought you said it was a\n\t\tnightmare?\n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A \nYOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He \nis wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him \nfrom his photograph. It is GABE.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tDaddy, what was that noise?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(surprised to see him)\n\t\tGabe?\n\t\t\t(he stares curiously at\n\t\t\this son)\n\t\tWhat are you doing ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tThere was a bang.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt was the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tIt's cold.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tTell your mother.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tMom, it's ...\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tI heard you. Go back to sleep.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tWill you tuck me in?\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\t(not happily)\n\t\tOh ... all right.\n\nShe starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE \nupside down and carries him into his\n\n\nGABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs \nand snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and \nELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJED\n\t\tDad?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJed. It's the middle of the night.\n\t\t\t(he kisses GABE and goes\n\t\t\tover to JED in the lower\n\t\t\tbunk)\n\t\tWhat's up?\n\n\t\t\t\tJED\n\t\tYou forgot my allowance.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYour allowance? It's five A.M. We'll\n\t\ttalk at breakfast.\n\n\t\t\t\tJED\n\t\tOkay, but don't forget.\n\nSuddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\tI love you, Dad.\n\nJACOB smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat is this, a convention? I love\n\t\tyou, too, Pickles. Now go back to\n\t\tsleep.\n\nHe turns to leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tWait ... Daddy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNow what?\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tDon't go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't go?\n\t\t\t(he smiles)\n\t\tI'm not going anywhere. I'm right\n\t\there, Gabe.\n\t\t\t(he looks at his son\n\t\t\ttenderly)\n\t\tCome on, go back to sleep. You can\n\t\tstill get a couple of hours.\n\nHe hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\t... I love you.\n\nThere is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB is struck \nby them.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDon't shut the door.\n\nJACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tA bit more ... a bit more.\n\nJACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure. \nGABE smiles and cuddles in his bed.\n\n\nINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nJACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable. \nJACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to \nhis neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI love you, Sarah.\n\nShe smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back \nasleep.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN\n\nWE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees \nmaterializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, \ncan be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting.\n\nSuddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic \nhumming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of \nheavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's \nvoices.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThey're here.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThank God. Move 'em out!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICES\n\t\tBust your balls!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tMove it! Move it!\n\nThere is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and \nspeed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself \nas a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a \nhuge CLEARING.\n\nHigh overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening \nwhine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS \nleap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with \nturbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices \nyell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency.\n\nThe CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the \nhelicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as \nthe CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come \ninto view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. \nHands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it.\n\nWatery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a \nheart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, \nwarm and familiar.\n\n\nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nJACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly \nJEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them \nin total confusion.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\tYou are a lucky man, my friend. A\n\t\tlucky man. You must have friends in\n\t\thigh places, that's all I can say.\n\nSAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands \nto the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them.\n\nSlowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the \ntile and collapses to the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO BLACK:\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nFADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on \na tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA \nLENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the \nBEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake.\n\t\t\t(she places her hand on\n\t\t\this head and strokes his\n\t\t\thair)\n\t\tYou're gonna be all right, Jake.\n\t\tYou're gonna be fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAm I home?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou're here. Home. The doctor said\n\t\tyou're lucky your brains didn't boil.\n\t\t\t(she smiles)\n\t\tWhat a night, Jake. It was crazy. You\n\t\tkept sayin' \"Sarah, close the\n\t\twindow,\" over and over. And talkin'\n\t\tto your kids. Even the dead one.\n\t\tWeird. You know you melted 200 pounds\n\t\tof ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAre we in Brooklyn?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou're right here, Jake. You just\n\t\trest.\n\t\t\t(she puffs up his\n\t\t\tpillow)\n\t\tThe doctor said you had a virus.\n\t\tThat's what they say when they don't\n\t\tknow what it is. You can't do\n\t\tanything for a week. He says you\n\t\tgotta recuperate.\n\t\t\t(she strokes his\n\t\t\tforehead, and gets up)\n\t\tNow you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman\n\t\tmade you some chicken soup. It'll\n\t\twarm you up.\n\nJEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost \nand confused.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\nJACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE. \nPILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them \nto distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches. \nShe wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another \nin the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou know, you really ought to get out\n\t\ttoday. You can't just sit around like\n\t\tthis all the time. It's not healthy.\n\t\tIt's not good for your mind. Go take\n\t\ta walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie.\n\t\tChrist, who's gonna know? You think I\n\t\tcare? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy\n\t\tyourself. One of us should be having\n\t\ta good time.\n\t\t\t(JEZZIE knocks on\n\t\t\tJACOB's head)\n\t\tHello! Anybody home?\n\t\t\t(she looks in his ear)\n\t\tAnybody in there?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat?\n\nJEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his \nbooks.\n\nCUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly \nhorns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after \npage of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of \nattention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tGoddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.\n\t\tI've had it up to here. Go ahead and\n\t\trot if you want ... You son-of-a-\n\t\tbitch, I'm talking to you.\n\nCUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's \nattention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE \nknocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly \nacross the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is \nshocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books \nonto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.\n\nJEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it \nback in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is \nabout to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing, her anger\n\t\t\tin check)\n\t\tI made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's\n\t\tin the fridge. Eat a carrot with it.\n\t\tThe aspirin's on the bottom shelf.\n\t\tWe're out of soap so, if for some\n\t\treason you decide to wash yourself\n\t\tagain, use the dishwashing stuff.\n\t\t\t(she walks out of the\n\t\t\troom and returns with\n\t\t\ther coat)\n\t\tI'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my\n\t\tnerves.\n\t\t\t(she bends down and\n\t\t\tmakes eye contact with\n\t\t\tJACOB)\n\t\tHello? Listen, I gotta go.\n\nJEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, \nraises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches \nJACOB's full attention.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.\n\t\t\t(she kisses his cheek)\n\t\tLove me a little?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(speaking with\n\t\t\taffection)\n\t\tYou are the most unbelievable woman I\n\t\thave ever met. One second you're a\n\t\tscreaming banshee and the next you're\n\t\tFlorence Nightingale. Who are you?\n\t\tThat's what I want to know. Will the\n\t\treal Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.\n\nSuddenly the telephone rings. It startles them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tOh shit. Tell 'em I've left.\n\nJEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A \npocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as \nshe struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the \nphone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tJacob Singer?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSpeaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tPaul Gruneger!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tPaul Gruneger! Well I'll be\n\t\tgoddamned!\n\nJACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss goodbye and \nhurries out the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tPaul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the\n\t\thell are you? I haven't seen you in\n\t\twhat, five, six, years?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tA long time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJesus Christ. How've you been? What's\n\t\thappening in your life?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tNothin' much.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMe neither. Nothing too exciting. So\n\t\ttell me, to what do I owe the honor?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tI need to see you, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But\n\t\tI'm kind of laid up here. I've been\n\t\tsick.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\t\tI need to see you.\n\n\nINT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY\n\nJACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading toward \nWILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them. JACOB pats PAUL on \nthe back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJesus, man, you look terrific. You\n\t\tmust have put on twenty pounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI work in a bakery.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou're lucky. How many vets you know\n\t\tare even employed?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tCount 'em on one hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's almost like a conspiracy, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tNo joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn\n\t\twar. I'm still fightin' it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's not worth it. You'll never win.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tYou tellin' me? How many times can\n\t\tyou die, huh?\n\nPAUL looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes. He sees a \nblack car tagging close behind him. He pulls out. So does the car.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tStill married, Jake?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNope.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tYou and everybody else. God I hate\n\t\tthis area. Makes me nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy the hell we drivin' here?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI just need to talk.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou can't talk in Brownsville?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI'm not sure where I can talk\n\t\tanymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tLet's get a couple drinks, okay?\n\t\t\t(he looks at his rear\n\t\t\tview mirror)\n\t\tHey, take a look behind us. Do you\n\t\tthink that car is followin' us?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(turning to look)\n\t\tThat black car?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tPull the mirror down on the sun\n\t\tvisor.\n\t\t\t(JACOB does)\n\t\tJust watch 'em.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's goin' on Paul?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou in trouble?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tYeah.\n\nJACOB notices PAUL's left arm. It is shaking. The black car passes on \nthe left. Both PAUL and JACOB stare at it as it speeds by.\n\n\nINT.  BAR - DAY\n\nJACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure WILLIAMSBURG \nBAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across the table in a very \nintimate fashion.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tSomethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know\n\t\twhat it is but I can't talk to\n\t\tanybody about it. I figured I could\n\t\twith you. You always used to listen,\n\t\tyou know?\n\nJACOB nods. PAUL takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into \nJACOB's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI'm going to Hell!\n\nJACOB's face grows suddenly tense.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThat's as straight as I can put it.\n\t\tAnd don't tell me that I'm crazy\n\t\t'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to\n\t\tHell. They're comin' after me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(frightened, but holding\n\t\t\tback)\n\t\tWho is?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tThey've been followin' me. They're\n\t\tcomin' outta the walls. I don't trust\n\t\tanyone. I'm not even sure I trust\n\t\tyou. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm\n\t\tgonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.\n\nPAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks away from \nthe booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but does not go after him. A \nYOUNG MAN in the next booth observes the scene with interest. He looks \nvaguely familiar, like we have seen him before.\n\nPAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke \nbox. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot. His \nfinger pushes a selection at random. Some '60's rock hit blares out. \nJACOB's mind is reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSorry. Sometimes I think I'm just\n\t\tgonna jump outta my skin. They're\n\t\tjust drivin' me wild.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho, Paul? What exactly ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI don't know who they are, or what\n\t\tthey are. But they're gonna get me\n\t\tand I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I\n\t\tcan't do anything. I can't go to my\n\t\tsisters. I can't even go home.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy not?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tThey're waitin' for me, that's why.\n\nPAUL's hand starts to shake. The tremor spreads rapidly to his whole \nbody. The booth begins to rattle.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI can't stop it. I try. Oh God! Help\n\t\tme Jake.\n\nJACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward \nPAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering \ncomfort as best he can.\n\nPAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's gesture. A few \nPEOPLE at the bar look over in their direction.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's okay, Paul. It's okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(crying)\n\t\tI don't know what to do.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't do anything.\n\t\t\t(PAUL begins to relax a\n\t\t\tbit and the shaking\n\t\t\tsubsides)\n\t\tPaul, I know what you're talking\n\t\tabout.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI've seen them too ... the demons!\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t\t(staring at JACOB)\n\t\tYou've seen them?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tEverywhere, like a plague.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tGod almighty. I thought I was the\n\t\tonly one.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMe, too. I had no idea. It's like I\n\t\twas coming apart at the seams.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tOh God. I know. I know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat is it Paul? What's happening to\n\t\tme?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tThey keep telling me I'm already\n\t\tdead, that they're gonna tear me\n\t\tapart, piece by piece, and throw me\n\t\tinto the fire.\n\t\t\t(he fumbles in his coat\n\t\t\tpocket and pulls out a\n\t\t\tsmall Bible and silver\n\t\t\tcross)\n\t\tI carry these everywhere but they\n\t\tdon't help. Nothing helps. Everyone\n\t\tthinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a\n\t\treport with the army.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tThe army?\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tShe said I haven't been the same\n\t\tsince then. Since that night. There's\n\t\tstill this big hole in my brain. It's\n\t\tso dark in there, Jake. And these\n\t\tcreatures. It's like they're crawling\n\t\tout of my brain. What happened that\n\t\tnight? Why won't they tell us?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know. I don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tThey're monsters, Jake. We're both\n\t\tseein' 'em. There's gotta be a\n\t\tconnection. Something.\n\nJACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG MAN in the \nnext booth is watching them with rapt attention.\n\n\nINT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY\n\nPAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the urinal.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tI'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I\n\t\tkeep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come\n\t\tup behind me. Somethin's wrong when a\n\t\tguy can't even take a leak by\n\t\thimself. I've seen 'em take people\n\t\tright off the street. I used to go\n\t\thome a different way every night. Now\n\t\tI can't even go home.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou come home with me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tWhat about your girlfriend? You don't\n\t\tthink she'll mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAre you kidding? We've put up more of\n\t\ther cousins. You wouldn't believe how\n\t\tthey breed down there.\n\nPAUL smiles.\n\n\nEXT.  BAR - DAY\n\nThe TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside. \nChristmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window. \nPAUL looks at them and smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tMerry Christmas.\n\nPAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car. \nHe pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the \nsidewalk and notices a dime.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn, this is my lucky day.\n\nHe bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and \nsteps on the gas. He turns the key.\n\nTHE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB \nsprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers \nhis head.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM\n\nCUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding \nall around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently. \nJACOB's eyes peer to the left.\n\nINFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of \nMEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a \nstream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The \nPILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands.\n\nJACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses \nhis ear close to JACOB to hear.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHelp me!\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tWe're doing the best we can.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGet me out of here!\n\n\nEXT.

Who are you?\n\nThe YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion \nconsumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The \nYOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tJust lie still. You're okay. You're\n\t\tnot hurt.\n\nThe CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown \napart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's \nneck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK \nCAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had \nhelped him. He is gone.\n\n\nEXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY\n\nA FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY\n\nJACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up. \nJACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive \nin silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches \nacross the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.\n\n\nEXT.  CEMETERY - DAY\n\nThe FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length \nof the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with \nWIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.\n\nThey are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the film, only \nthey are older now. A small group of FAMILY MEMBERS are helped to the \ngraveside.\n\nJACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry the casket in \nsemi-military formation to the grave.\n\n\nINT.  PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nJACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's living room, \ntalking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are \ncomforting her.\n\nJEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING ROOM and \nnibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is with her and they \nseem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation.\n\nJACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a tired, \ndefeated look about them.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tDid anyone see the police report? It\n\t\tsounds like a detonation job to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tThe paper said it was electrical; a\n\t\tfreak accident.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tBullshit. Someone's covering\n\t\tsomethin'. That was no accident.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tWhy do you say that?\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tCars don't explode that way. Any\n\t\tsimpleton knows that.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tBut the paper ...\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tThat was set. I'm tellin' you.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tBy who? Why? Paul didn't have an\n\t\tenemy in the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tHow do you know?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tHey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd\n\t\twant to hurt him?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat did he talk about when you guys\n\t\twent out? Did he say anything?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe was upset. He thought people were\n\t\tfollowing him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYou're kidding. Who?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe didn't know ... Demons.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t(obviously struck by the\n\t\t\tword)\n\t\tWhat do you mean, demons?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe told me he was going to Hell.\n\nThe statement has a surprising impact on the group. There is immediate \nsilence and eyes averted from one another.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tWhat'd he say that for? What made him\n\t\tsay that? Strange, huh? Strange.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tWhat else did he say, Jake?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe was scared. He saw these creatures\n\t\tcoming out of the woodwork. They were\n\t\ttryin' to get him, he said.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t(his arm shaking)\n\t\tHow long had that been going on?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tA couple of weeks, I think.\n\nHe notices GEORGE's beer can rattling.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tHe say what they looked like?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. Not really ...\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tExcuse me a minute. I'll be right\n\t\tback.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tIn one end, out the other, huh\n\t\tGeorge?\n\nGEORGE tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. His arm is nearly \nout of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tStill a spastic, huh? I hope you can\n\t\thold your dick better than you hold\n\t\tthat can.\n\nNo one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.\n\n\nEXT.  A BACK ALLEY - DAY\n\nThe SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It is already \ngray and getting darker.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tI know what Paul was talking about. I\n\t\tdon't know how to say this ... but in\n\t\ta way it's a relief knowing that\n\t\tsomeone else saw them, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tYou're seeing ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tThey're not human, I'll tell you\n\t\tthat. A car tried to run over me the\n\t\tother day. It was aiming straight for\n\t\tme. I saw their faces. They weren't\n\t\tfrom Brooklyn.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tWhat are you tellin' me? They're from\n\t\tthe Bronx?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tIt was no joke, Rod.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tSomething weird is going on here.\n\t\tWhat is it about us? Even in Nam it\n\t\twas always weird. Are we all crazy or\n\t\tsomething?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tYeah, ever since that ...\n\nHe hesitates. They all understand.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tWhat's that have to do with anything?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt was bad grass. That's all it was.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tGrass never did that to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tYou know, I've been to three shrinks\n\t\tand a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates\n\t\tthat night. Nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tIt's not worth goin' over again and\n\t\tagain. Whatever happened, happened.\n\t\tIt's over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t... I've seen them, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tShit!\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tSo have I.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLook, there's something fucking\n\t\tstrange going on here.

His car blew up, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tDr. Carlson's dead?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAn explosion, just like Paul's.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tNo!\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJesus!\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tYou think they're connected?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(he nods)\n\t\tI think something's fucking connect-\n\t\ted. I mean, a car tried to run me \n\t\tover the other day. Doug too, right? \n\t\tWe've got six guys here going fucking\n\t\tcrazy.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tNot me, buddy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOkay, not you Rod. But the rest of us\n\t\tare flipping out for some goddamn\n\t\treason. They're tryin' to kill us.\n\t\tFuck it man, we need to find out\n\t\twhat's going on.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tDo you think it has something to do\n\t\twith ... the offensive?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's got something to do with some-\n\t\tthing. I think we've got to confront\n\t\tthe army. If they're hiding shit from\n\t\tus, we better find out what it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tCome on, Professor. The army's not\n\t\tgonna give you any answers. You'll be\n\t\tbuttin' your head against a stone\n\t\twall.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMaybe that's the only way to get\n\t\tthrough. Besides, six heads'll be\n\t\tbetter than one.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tNot my head, buddy. Not me. I'm\n\t\tgettin' a headache just listenin' to\n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWe should get ourselves a lawyer.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tI say you should get a shrink.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tToo late. I've tried. I think you're\n\t\tright, Jake. I'm game.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tMe, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tYou guys are fucking paranoid. It was\n\t\tbad grass. That's all it was. There's\n\t\tno such thing as demons.\n\n\nINT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY\n\nJACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on plush chairs \nin the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a red-faced man with three \nchins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then \nspits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tI'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you\n\t\thave any idea how many people come to\n\t\tme with the injustices of the world?\n\t\tIt'd break your heart.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThis isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The\n\t\tarmy did something to us and we've\n\t\tgot to find out what.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tThe army. The army. What is it with\n\t\tyou guys? We're not talking about a\n\t\ttrip to the library here. This is the\n\t\tUnited States Government for God's\n\t\tsake. This is red tape coming out of\n\t\tyour ass. You know what I mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tExactly. And we need someone to cut\n\t\tthrough it. We hear you're the man.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tOh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason\n\t\there?\n\nGEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He \nchomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no \ntakers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOkay. I'll look into it.\n\nThe MEN are surprised and excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\tWow! Do you think we have a chance?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tWhat do you want, a fortune teller or\n\t\ta lawyer? ... I'll need sworn\n\t\tdepositions from each of you and a\n\t\tlist of the other members of the\n\t\tplatoon, or their survivors.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOUG\n\t\tHey, this is great.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tI'll tell you, if we find the \n\t\tmilitary is implicated in any way,\n\t\tyou could stand to recover quite a\n\t\tlot of money. Not that I can predict\n\t\tanything, but some class action suits\n\t\tof this kind have been awarded fairly\n\t\tgenerous judgements. That wouldn't be\n\t\tso bad, would it Mr. Singer?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDoctor.\n\t\t\t(GEARY looks at him\n\t\t\toddly)\n\t\tPh.D.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tAh! I thought you were a mailman.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI am.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\t\t(confused)\n\t\tThen why aren't you teaching? Why\n\t\taren't you in a university?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm too messed up to teach.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tAh! Well then, they're going to have\n\t\tto pay for that, aren't they?\n\nThe MEN all nod in agreement.\n\n\nEXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY\n\nJACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are jubilant, \nclasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they \nbreak up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a \ncab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind \nit. It follows them out of sight.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nJACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen \nfloor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand splashes into the dog's \nbowl. Nothing impedes their passion. JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and \nswoons. Hands grab hold of table legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly \nagainst the stove. It is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.\n\nJACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in \nJEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and radiant. They lie \nexhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSo tell me ... am I still an angel?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(smiling broadly)\n\t\tWith wings. You transport me, you\n\t\tknow that? You carry me away.\n\nJEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with \nher pinky. JACOB loves it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWe're all angels, you know ...\n\t\t\t(she bites his earlobe.\n\t\t\tHe winces)\n\t\t... and devils. It's just what you\n\t\tchoose to see.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI love you, Jez.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tUnderneath all the bullshit, just\n\t\tlove.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tRemember that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou know what? I feel ... exorcised\n\t\t... like the demons are gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHow come? The army?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIn a way. At least now I have some\n\t\tidea of what was happening. If we can\n\t\tonly get them to admit ... to explain\n\t\twhat they did ... I don't know. Maybe\n\t\tit'd clear things up in my head. I'll\n\t\ttell you something, Jez, honestly\n\t\t... I thought they were real.\n\nSilence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to \ndeath. They laugh and tumble back to the floor.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - EVENING\n\nJACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe. JEZZIE is \nmoving rapidly around the KITCHEN.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI put a frozen dinner in the oven, a\n\t\tManhandler. It'll be ready at a\n\t\tquarter of. I threw a little salad\n\t\ttogether. It's in the fridge. I also\n\t\tbought some apple juice, Red Cheek.\n\t\tDon't drink it all. Oh, and Jake,\n\t\tyour lawyer called.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe did? When?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(grabbing her coat)\n\t\tWhile you were in the shower.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy didn't you call me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHe didn't give me a chance.\n\t\t\t(she pauses nervously)\n\t\tLook, honey, don't get upset, but\n\t\the's not taking your case.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tWhat? What do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHe said you didn't have one.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's he talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI don't know. That's all he said. He\n\t\twasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He\n\t\tsaid your buddies backed down. They\n\t\tchickened out, he said.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't believe this.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tBaby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd\n\t\tstay and talk but I'm so late. Look,\n\t\tdon't be upset. We'll talk when I get\n\t\thome. See you around midnight.\n\t\t\t(she kisses him on the\n\t\t\tcheek)\n\t\tBye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or\n\t\tsomething.\n\n\nJACOB'S APT./FRANK'S APT. - INTERCUT\n\nThe door slams securely. The locks set. JACOB begins instantly rifling \nthrough a desk drawer. He comes up with a frayed address book and looks \nup a number. He dials.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.O.)\n\t\tHello.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tFrank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.\n\nWe see FRANK standing at a window fingering the Venetian blinds. He \ndoes not reply. The scene intercuts between the two men.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen, I just got a strange call\n\t\tfrom Geary. He said the guys backed\n\t\tdown. What's he talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(fingering the Venetian\n\t\t\tblinds)\n\t\tThat's right. We did.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat does that mean, Frank? I don't\n\t\tget it. Why?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt's hard to explain.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tWell, try, huh.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI don't know if I can. It's just that\n\t\twar is war. Things happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThings happen? What the fuck are you\n\t\ttalking about? They did something to\n\t\tus, Frank. We have to expose this.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThere's nothing to expose.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJesus Christ! Who's been talking to\n\t\tyou?\n\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\tWhat's going on? How can you just\n\t\tturn away?\n\t\t\t(no response)\n\t\tWhat about the others?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThey're not interested, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShit! You know it's not half the case\n\t\tif I go it alone. We're all suffering\n\t\tthe same symptoms, Frank. The army is\n\t\tto blame. They've done something to\n\t\tus. How can you not want to know?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(pausing)\n\t\tMaybe it's not the army, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tMaybe there's a larger truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tMaybe the demons are real.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it. What kind of bullshit is\n\t\tthat?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tListen, Jake. I gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the hell? What kind of mumbo\n\t\tjumbo ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI'm hanging up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHey, wait!\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tDon't bother to call again, okay?\n\nFRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long time, until \nthe high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook. \nThe sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. QUickly JACOB \ntears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. They \naren't there.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShit!\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT.\n\nJACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the \ncloset. The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and \nphotos of old comrades. Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet \nscribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs \nit. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks \nit up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a \nchild's handwriting. \"DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT \nA FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nGABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running \nalongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the \nhandlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of \nfalse starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an \ninstant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face. \nJACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from \nus and heads into the distance.\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT BACK TO:\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nJACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. Suddenly \nhis eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted \non the bedroom door. Something in the mirror, like the image of a \nchild, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious, \nJACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops \nmoving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in \nthe mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his \nhand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB \nmoves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is \nthe  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An \nunearthly scream comes from both their mouths.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNO!!!\n\n\nINT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nA huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.\n\nHe is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house \ncorridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a \nsandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he \nwalks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGeary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it!\n\t\tYou can't just walk away from this.\n\nGEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWho's been talking to you? The army?\n\t\tHave they been talking to you, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tNobody's been talking to nobody. You\n\t\tdon't have a case, you hear me? It's\n\t\tpure and simple. Now leave me alone.\n\t\tOkay?\n\nJACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up short.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTake your hands off me!\n\nJACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tListen, will you listen? They're\n\t\ttrying to get me. They're comin' out\n\t\tof the walls. The army's done\n\t\tsomething to me. I need you.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tYou need ... a doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tA doctor? And what's he gonna do,\n\t\ttell me I'm crazy? They've fucked\n\t\twith my head. I've got to prove it.\n\t\tYou've got to do something.\n\nGEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tThere's nothing I can do.\n\nHe turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes \nafter him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.\n\nMayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB \ncatches up to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tYou mind? I'm eating, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSomething's going on here. You're not\n\t\ttelling me something. What the hell's\n\t\tgotten into you?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tI'll tell you what's gotten into me.\n\t\tI don't know you from Adam, right?\n\t\tYou come to my office with this\n\t\tbizarro story and demand I look into\n\t\tit. Okay. I said I'd check it out and\n\t\tI did. Now I don't know what kind of\n\t\tfool you take me for, but you have\n\t\tused and abused me, and I don't like\n\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tUsed you?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tI talked to the Army's Bureau of\n\t\tRecords. You've never even been to\n\t\tViet Nam.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the hell is that supposed to\n\t\tmean?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tIt means that you and your buddies\n\t\tare whacko, that you were discharged\n\t\ton psychological grounds after some\n\t\twar games in Thailand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tWar games? Thailand? That's not true!\n\t\tHow can you believe that? Can't you\n\t\tsee what they're doing? It's all a\n\t\tlie. We were in Da Nang, for God's\n\t\tsake. You've got to believe me.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tI don't have to do any such thing.\n\t\tI'm eating my lunch, okay?\n\nGEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away. JACOB, enraged, \ncharges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out \nof GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou slimy bastard! You goddamn piece\n\t\tof shit!\n\nWith a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other \nhand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and \nmayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away.\n\n\nCUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators. \nThere is a look of satisfaction on his face.\n\n\nCUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials. Someone comes on \nthe line. GEARY speaks quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEARY\n\t\tHe's on his way.\n\nCUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is \nplaying \"Sonny Boy\" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear \nit. He presses the down button for the main floor.\n\n\nThe elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL \nSOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOLDIER 1\n\t\tLet's go, Singer.\n\nJACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two of the \nSOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOLDIER 2\n\t\tYou're coming with us.\n\n\nINT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nJACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two \nofficious looking MEN. The doors lock from the DRIVER's command.\n\n\t\t\t\tARMY OFFICIAL #1\n\t\tMr. Singer. What an appropriate name\n\t\tfor a man who can't keep his mouth\n\t\tshut.\n\nThe car drives off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho are you? What do you want?\n\n\t\t\t\tARMY OFFICIAL #2\n\t\tWe've been watching you for a long\n\t\ttime. You and your friends. You've\n\t\tbeen exhibiting some very odd\n\t\tbehavior. Frightening people with\n\t\tfoolish talk about demons - and\n\t\texperiments.\n\nJACOB tries to speak but the other MAN grabs his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tARMY OFFICIAL #1\n\t\tYou're in over your head, Mr. Singer.\n\t\tMen drown that way. The army was\n\t\tanother part of your life. Forget it.\n\t\tIt is dead and buried. Let it lie.\n\n\t\t\t\tARMY OFFICIAL #2\n\t\tI hope we have made our point, Mr.\n\t\tSinger.\n\nJACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk. \nLetting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman. He \nis totally out of control.\n\nWith a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door flies open. It \nflaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. JACOB tries to jump \nout, but the men yank him back in. One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB \nsees it and goes crazy. His feet kick in all directions, slamming the \nDRIVER's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.\n\nThe car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor. \nThe men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat. In the mayhem, JACOB \nthrows himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement. \nPeople look down at him as the car speeds away.\n\n\nEXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nJACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up, \nbut can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore \nhim and hurry past.\n\nA SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a \nmoment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He \nleans down and steals his wallet.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANTA\n\t\tMerry Christmas.\n\n\nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING\n\nCUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through the streets.\n\n\nINT.  HOSPITAL - EVENING\n\nAN AMBULANCE CREW rushes JACOB to a HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEARER\n\t\tHe's been screaming like a madman.\n\t\tYou better get something in him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\t\t(approaching JACOB)\n\t\tHi. I'm Doctor Stewart. Can you tell\n\t\tme what happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMy back. I can't move. I need my\n\t\tchiropractor.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tYour back? Did you fall?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEARER\n\t\tThey said he slipped on the ice. May\n\t\thave hit his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tATTENDANT\n\t\tDoes he have any identification?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEARER\n\t\tNo waller. Nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThey stole it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tWho did?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know. Santa Claus. I had my\n\t\tson's picture in it. Gabe's picture.\n\t\tIt's the only one I had.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tWe better get an orthopedic man in\n\t\there. Is Dr. Davis on call?\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tI'll page him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tCall my chiropractor.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tWe're doing everything we can.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLouis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tI'm going to have to move you a bit,\n\t\tjust to check for injuries. This may\n\t\thurt a little.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. Don't move me.\n\nThe RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tI don't have to ask if you can feel\n\t\tthat.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it. I want Louis.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tWho's Louis?\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT\n\t\tHe's out of it. I'm taking him down\n\t\tto X-ray.\n\nAn ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors. JACOB \ntries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized.\n\n\nINT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT\n\nJACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of \ncorridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity. \nThe smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet \nplod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along \nthe way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body \nparts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves \nfaster.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere are you taking me? Where am I?\n\n\t\t\t\tORDERLY\n\t\tYou know where you are.\n\nJACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to \nthe side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one \nfights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors. \nOccasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in \nstrange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from \nmetal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard \nheater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A \nbicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and \nmangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is \nnot his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His \nwhole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head \nvibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before. \nJACOB screams.\n\n\nINT.  ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of \"DOCTORS\" are waiting. As \nthey draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right. \nThey bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of \nanother world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot \nmove. He tries to scream but no sound comes out.\n\nChains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached \nwith speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God!\n\nThe \"DOCTORS\" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB \nis left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of \"DOCTORS\" emerges \nfrom the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They \nsurround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB \nis panting and sweating in fear. One of the \"DOCTORS\" leans over JACOB. \nHe gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJEZZIE!\n\nShe pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN \nHER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming \nwith maggots. The \"DOCTORS\" laugh. They take great pleasure in his \nsuffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance \ncontains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, \ntaunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a \ntorment of its own.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGet me out of here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tWhere do you want to go?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tTake me home.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tHome?\n\t\t\t(they all laugh)\n\t\tThis is your home. You're dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm\n\t\tnot dead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tWhat are you then?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm alive.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tThen what are you doing here?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know. I don't know.\n\t\t\t(he struggles like an\n\t\t\tanimal)\n\t\tThis isn't happening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tWhat isn't happening?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLet me out of here!\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tThere is no out of here. You've been\n\t\tkilled. Don't you remember?\n\nA \"DOCTOR\" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he \nhas no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and \npositions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a \nparticular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the \n\"DOCTOR\" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into \nhis brain. JACOB howls.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nCUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence \nof the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in \nthe dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long \nbayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out.\n\n\nINT.  ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT BACK TO THE \"DOCTORS\".\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tRemember?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo! That was years ago! I've lived\n\t\tyears since then.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n\t\tIt's all been a dream.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo! The army did this to me! They've\n\t\tdone something to my brain.\n\t\t\t(he raves like a madman)\n\t\tJezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm\n\t\tnot dead! I want my family!\n\nThe \"DOCTORS\" laugh and back away, disappearing into the darkness.\n\n\nINT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n\nSuddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead. NORMAL HOSPITAL WALLS \nmaterialize instantaneously around him. A NURSE enters the room \nfollowed by SARAH, ELI, and JED. They approach JACOB who is lying in \ntraction, suspended over a hospital bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tHe's still pretty doped up. I don't\n\t\tthink he'll be able to talk yet and I\n\t\tdoubt that he'll recognize you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tI just want to see him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJED\n\t\t\t(eating a Snickers bar)\n\t\tDad. Hi.

We heard what\n\t\thappened.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(his voice hoarse,\n\t\t\tnearly whispering)\n\t\tI'm not dead. I am not dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tNo. Of course you're not. You've just\n\t\thurt your back. That's all. You're\n\t\tgoing to be fine. It'll just take\n\t\tsome time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJED\n\t\tA month, they said.\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\t\t(trying to joke)\n\t\tYou just hang in there, Dad.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\t(smacking him)\n\t\tThat's not funny.\n\t\t\t(she reaches over and\n\t\t\trubs JACOB's brow)\n\t\tWhat a mess, huh? God I wish there\n\t\twas something I could do. I love you,\n\t\tJacob. For whatever that's worth. I\n\t\tdo.\n\nThere is a sudden sound of \"DOCTORS\" laughing. JACOB jerks his head \npainfully, but does not see them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\" (O.S.)\n\t\tDream on!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(yelling at the unseen\n\t\t\tvoice)\n\t\tNo! Oh God.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\tJacob, what can I do?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSave me!\n\nJACOB's plea confuses SARAH. She responds with a kiss.\n\n\nINT.  HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nDAYLIGHT streams through the window in JACOB's ROOM. He is still in \ntraction and looks very uncomfortable. A new NURSE enters holding a \nplastic container with a straw poking out.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tWell, don't we look better this\n\t\tmorning? That was a hard night,\n\t\twasn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere am I?\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tLennox Hospital.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm awake?\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tYou look awake to me.

Where did she go?\n\t\t\t(the NURSE gives him a\n\t\t\tstrange look)\n\t\tShe was here ...\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tNo. No. You haven't had any visitors.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThat's a lie. My family was here.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tI'm sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLast night! They were as real as you\n\t\tare!\n\nThe NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThis is not a dream! This is my life.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tOf course it is. What else could it\n\t\tbe?\n\nShe giggles nervously. There is a funny glint in her eyes. JACOB looks \naway. He doesn't want to see it.\n\n\nOMIT\n\n\nINT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING\n\nThere is a loud commotion in the HALL. We see LOUIS SCHWARTZ, JACOB's \nchiropractor, screaming JACOB's name.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tJacob! Jacob Singer!\n\nJACOB yells.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLouis! I'm here! In here!\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY\n\nLOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and \nORDERLIES.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLOUIS!\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE 1\n\t\tYou can't go in there!\n\n\t\t\t\tORDERLY\n\t\tYou're going to have to leave.\n\nLOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction \napparatus. He begins to yell.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tGood God, Jake. What have they done?\n\t\t\t(he examines JACOB and\n\t\t\tscreams at the NURSES)\n\t\tWhat is this, the Middle Ages? And\n\t\tthey call this modern medicine. This\n\t\tis barbaric! Barbaric!\n\t\t\t(turning to JACOB)\n\t\tIt's okay, Jake. It's not serious.\n\t\tI'll get you out of here.\n\t\t\t(yelling at the ORDERLY)\n\t\tWhat is this, the Inquisition? Why\n\t\tdon't you just burn him at the stake\n\t\tand put him out of his misery?\n\nLOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the \npulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES \nbecome instantly hysterical and start screaming.\n\n\t\t\t\tORDERLY\n\t\tWhat the hell do you think ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tDon't you come near me.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE 2\n\t\tYou can't do that!\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWhat is this, a prison? Stay back.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE 1\n\t\tYou can't. Call the police.\n\nOne of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of \nthe pulley chains. It just misses.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(to the ORDERLIES)\n\t\tYou take one step and I'll wrap this\n\t\taround your neck.\n\nLOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHold on, Jake, we're getting out of\n\t\there.\n\nNURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room.\n\n\nOMIT\n\n\nINT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING\n\nLOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared \nwith the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the \ntable rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it \ndown to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tHalf an hour from now and you'll be\n\t\twalking out of here all by yourself.\n\t\tMark my words.\n\t\t\t(JACOB barely hears\n\t\t\tthem)\n\t\tWell, you've done it to yourself this\n\t\ttime, haven't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(nearly whispering)\n\t\tAm I dead, Louis?\n\t\t\t(LOUIS leans over to\n\t\t\thear)\n\t\tAm I dead?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tFrom a slipped disc?

It's all pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(working on JACOB's\n\t\t\tspine like a master\n\t\t\tmechanic)\n\t\tYou ever read Meister Eckart?\n\t\t\t(JACOB shakes his head\n\t\t\t\"no\")\n\t\tHow did you ever get your Doctorate\n\t\twithout reading Eckart?\n\t\t\t(LOUIS takes hold of\n\t\t\tJACOB's legs and yanks\n\t\t\tthem swiftly)\n\t\tGood. Okay, let's turn over gently.\n\t\tRight side.\n\nJACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tThe other \"right,\" okay?\n\t\t\t(he helps JACOB turn\n\t\t\tover)\n\t\tYou're a regular basket case, you\n\t\tknow that?\n\t\t\t(he moves JACOB's arm\n\t\t\tover his head)\n\t\tEckart saw Hell, too.\n\nLOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down \non his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know what he said? The only thing\n\t\tthat burns in Hell is the part of you\n\t\tthat won't let go of your life; your\n\t\tmemories, your attachments. They burn\n\t\t'em all away. But they're not punish-\n\t\ting you, he said. They're freeing\n\t\tyour soul. Okay, other side.\n\nHe helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine \ncracks.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWonderful. So the way he sees it, if\n\t\tyou're frightened of dying and hold-\n\t\ting on, you'll see devils tearing\n\t\tyour life away. But if you've made\n\t\tyour peace then the devils are really\n\t\tangels freeing you from the earth.\n\t\tIt's just a matter of how you look at\n\t\tit, that's all. So don't worry, okay?\n\t\tRelax. Wiggle your toes.\n\nJACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the \nlower vertebrae in his back.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tPerfect. We got it.\n\t\t\t(LOUIS pushes a lever\n\t\t\tand the table rises back\n\t\t\tup)\n\t\tOkay. Let's just give it a little\n\t\ttry. See if you can stand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat? By myself?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tYou can do it. Come on. Easy. Just\n\t\tgive it a try.\n\nJACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with \ndeliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing \nthe lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. \nJACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like \na giant cherub.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tHallelujah.\n\nLOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually \nrediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence \nreturns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns \nand heads toward the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThere's something I've gotta take\n\t\tcare of, Louis.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?

No more rest.\n\nHe walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him. JACOB turns \naround and shakes his head \"no.\" The look on his face is firm and \ndefiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI love you, Louis.\n\n\nEXT.  U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of \nlower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television \ncameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush \nto the scene.\n\nCUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the \nother he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps \nof the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes \nagainst his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon \ncontainer lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently \nand pours onto the street.

Four\n\t\tcompanies engaged in an enemy\n\t\toffensive that not one of us who\n\t\tsurvived can remember fighting.\n\n\t\t\t\tBYSTANDERS\n\t\tUse the torch!\n\n\t\t\t\tONLOOKER\n\t\tShut up! Let him talk!\n\nPOLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready hoses at \nnearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tYou don't forget a battle where 500\n\t\tmen were killed. They did something\n\t\tto us. I want to know the truth, the\n\t\tgoddamn truth. We have a right to\n\t\tknow.\n\t\t\t(he yells toward the\n\t\t\tcameras)\n\t\tAre you getting all this? I want this\n\t\ton national T.V. I want the whole\n\t\tcountry, the whole world to know.\n\nHe holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThrow that torch away, young man.\n\t\tGive yourself up. You're under\n\t\tarrest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tFor what? For seeking the truth?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tPlease come quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou come near me and I'll blow us all\n\t\tup.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWe're not going to hurt you.\n\n\t\t\t\tONLOOKER\n\t\tGive him a chance to talk!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThe army will deny it. They've\n\t\tfalsified my records. They've lied to\n\t\tmy lawyer, threatened my buddies. But\n\t\tthey can't threaten me.\n\n\t\t\t\tBYSTANDER\n\t\tYou tell 'em!\n\n\t\t\t\tBYSTANDER\n\t\tUse the torch!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOkay, let's clear the area. Everyone\n\t\tout.\n\nSuddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB is enraged. \nHe brandishes the torch at the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the fuck do you think you're\n\t\tdoing?\n\nAnother match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the \nfringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tClear the area. This is an order!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat is wrong with you?\n\nWe hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some \nof their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another \nmatch. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back.\n\nSuddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the \nARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun. \nJACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNO!\n\nWith a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We \nsee it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes \nstare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex, \njust below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd \nturn to fear. SOMEONE yells.\n\n\t\t\t\tONLOOKER\n\t\tHe'll burn us all!\n\nScreams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential \nconflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost \nheroically, in the middle of it all.\n\nSuddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with \na blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE \npanic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY \nOFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and \nrush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they \nspread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through \nthe frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the \nscene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nJACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a \nshower spray. The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up. \nAnxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase \nfrom the BEDROOM closet, and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries \nback to the shower, tests it, and jumps in.\n\nLather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. His \nentire body is covered in suds. He is washing as quickly as he can. \nSuddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho's there? Who is it?\n\nJACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are burning. \nThere is a shadow behind the curtain.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGoddamn it! Who's there?\n\nJACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower curtain is \nthrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand reaches in and pulls \nhis nipple, pinching hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's just me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJezzie?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWho else were you expecting?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLet go!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhere were you, Jake? Where've you\n\t\tbeen? Why haven't you called?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tStay away from me, Jez.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI want to know. You tell me!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou wanna know? Turn on the T.V.\n\t\tWatch the fucking news!\n\nHe pushes her away and jumps out of the shower.\n\nCUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his \nsuitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhy are you doing this to me? You\n\t\tcan't just go away like that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI can do anything I want.\n\nShe stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt might be for me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm not here. You haven't seen me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(picking up the\n\t\t\treceiver)\n\t\tHello ... No. He's not here. I\n\t\thaven't seen him all night ... I\n\t\tdon't know when ... What? Tell him\n\t\twhat?\n\t\t\t(JACOB looks up)\n\t\tVietnam? ... What experiments?\n\nJACOB lunges for the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello. This is Jacob Singer.\n\t\t\t(he listens with growing\n\t\t\tfascination)\n\t\tGod almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right.\n\t\tWhere would you like to meet?\n\t\t\t(he listens)\n\t\tHow will I know you.\n\t\t\t(JACOB seems\n\t\t\tuncomfortable)\n\t\tOkay. I'll be there.\n\nHe hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWho was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tA chemist. Part of a chemical warfare\n\t\tunit out of Saigon. He said he knows me\n\t\tand that I'll know him when I see him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHow?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI have no idea.\n\t\t\t(he thinks)\n\t\tI was right. There were experiments.\n\t\tI knew it. I knew it. My God.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHow do you know he's telling the\n\t\ttruth?\n\nJACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond. The \n11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We \nhear the NEWSCASTER speaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER\n\t\tLeading the news tonight, a bizarre\n\t\tdemonstration on the steps of the\n\t\tU.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in\n\t\tdowntown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an\n\t\talleged Vietnam vet ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAlleged? Alleged?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER\n\t\t... challenged the United States Army\n\t\tto admit conducting secret experi-\n\t\tments involving hundreds of American\n\t\tsoldiers during the Vietnam war.\n\nJEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his suitcase and \nhurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the \nhallway. JEZZIE runs after him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(almost threatening)\n\t\tDon't leave me, Jake.\n\n\nINT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nJACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL. He \nstops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is still standing there. \nShe is very angry. JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then \ndisappears down the stairwell.\n\n\nEXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\nJACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black \nleather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity. \nOne MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tJacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.\n\t\tFriends call me Mike.\n\nJACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has \nappeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSurprised, huh? I told you you'd know\n\t\tme. I've been tracking you for a long\n\t\ttime. I just wish I'd spoken to you\n\t\tbefore tonight.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't get it. Who are you? Why have\n\t\tyou been following me?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tObservation, mainly. Clinical study.\n\t\tYou were one of the survivors.\n\nA POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder \nand turns him away nervously.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCome on, we're not safe around here.\n\n\nHUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT\n\nJACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts \ninto the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's \nstory.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tSo first I'm arrested, right? Best\n\t\tLSD I ever made, right down the\n\t\tdrain. I figure this is it, twenty\n\t\tyears in the joint, if I'm lucky.\n\t\tThat was '68.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLong time ago.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(nodding his head)\n\t\tNext thing I know I'm on Rikers\n\t\tIsland. Ever been there?\n\t\t\t(JACOB shakes his head)\n\t\tSuddenly they take me from my cell to\n\t\tthe visitors room with those bank\n\t\tteller windows, you know. Four army\n\t\tcolonels, medals up their asses, are\n\t\tstanding on the other side. They tell\n\t\tme if I'll come to Vietnam for two\n\t\tyears, no action, mind you, just work\n\t\tin a lab, they'll drop all the\n\t\tcharges and wipe the record clean.\n\t\tWell, I'd only been in jail for\n\t\tthirteen hours and I already knew\n\t\tthat Nam couldn't be any worse.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShows how much you knew.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tNo shit. They had me by the balls.\n\t\tNext thing I know I'm in Saigon ...\n\t\tin a secret lab synthesizing mind-\n\t\taltering drugs. Not the street stuff\n\t\tmind you. They had us isolating\n\t\tspecial properties. The dark side,\n\t\tyou know? They wanted a drug that\n\t\tincreased aggressive tendencies.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYeah, sure. We were losing the war.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tRight. They were worried. They\n\t\tfigured you guys were too soft. They\n\t\twanted something to stir you up, tap\n\t\tinto your anger, you know? And we did\n\t\tit. The most powerful thing I ever\n\t\tsaw. Even a bad trip, and I had my\n\t\tshare, never compared to the fury of\n\t\tthe Ladder.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThe Ladder?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tThat's what they called it. A fast\n\t\ttrip right down the ladder.\n\t\t\t(he makes a downward\n\t\t\tdive with his hand)\n\t\tRight to the primal fear, the base\n\t\tanger. I'm tellin' you, it was\n\t\tpowerful stuff. But I don't need to\n\t\ttell you. You know.\n\nJACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is \nso powerful to his mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWe did experiments on jungle monkeys.\n\t\tThey bashed each other's heads in,\n\t\tgouged out their eyes, chewed off\n\t\ttheir tails. The brass loved it. Then\n\t\tthey made us try it on Charlie.\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tThey took these POW's, just kids\n\t\treally, and put 'em in a courtyard.\n\t\tWe fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.\n\t\t\t(he stops for a moment;\n\t\t\ta tear rolls down his\n\t\t\tcheek)\n\t\tThey were worse than the monkeys. I\n\t\tnever knew men could do such things.\n\t\tThe whole thing still blows me away.\n\nMICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the PIER. JACOB, \nastounded, gets up and walks beside him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnyway, this big offensive was coming\n\t\tup. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,\n\t\tHuntley-Brinkley. And the brass was\n\t\tscared 'cause they knew we couldn't\n\t\twin. Morale was down. It was gettin'\n\t\tugly in the States. Hell, you\n\t\tremember.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tLike it was yesterday.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tA couple days later they decided to\n\t\tuse the Ladder, on one test\n\t\tbattalion. Yours. Just in an\n\t\tinfintessimal dose in the food\n\t\tsupply, to prove its effectiveness in\n\t\tthe field. They were sure your unit\n\t\twould have the highest kill ratio in\n\t\tthe whole goddamn offensive. And you\n\t\tdid, too. But not the way they\n\t\ttnought.\n\nJACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of pills out of \nhis jacket pocket.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey, want something to calm you down?\n\t\tMade 'em myself.\n\nJACOB shakes his head no.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNone of us can remember that night. I\n\t\tget flashes of it but they don't make\n\t\tsense. We saw shrinks for years. But\n\t\tnothing they did could ever touch it.\n\t\tWhat happened? Was there ever an\n\t\toffensive?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tA couple of days later. It was\n\t\tfierce. You guys never saw it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tBut there was an attack. I can still\n\t\tsee them coming. There was a fight,\n\t\twasn't there?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tYeah. But not with the Cong.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho then?\n\nHe hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy. He looks at \nthe river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tYou killed each other.\n\nJACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nGunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam. JACOB is at \nthe bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK. Chaos surrounds them. Men \nare screaming. The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear. ROD raises \nhis bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only \nafter a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed. \nROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.\n\n\t\t\t\tROD\n\t\tOh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?\n\nJACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN \nSOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up, knocking JACOB to the \nground and slamming his rifle into JACOB's back. As he spins around \nJACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at \nJACOB's stomach. For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his \nattacker. He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing \nglasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. It \nseems like a moment out of time. And then the SOLDIER lurches forward \nand rams his bayonet deep into JACOB's abdomen.\n\nCUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tIt was brother against brother. No\n\t\tdiscrimination. You tore each other\n\t\tto pieces. I knew it would happen. I\n\t\twarned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was\n\t\tjust a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!\n\t\tAnd I helped 'em make the stuff ... I\n\t\ttalked to the guys who bagged the\n\t\tbodies. They're in worse shape than\n\t\tyou, believe me. They saw what was\n\t\tleft. It's a blessing you don't\n\t\tremember. Of course the brass covered\n\t\tthe whole thing up right away. Blamed\n\t\tit all on a surprise attack.\n\t\t\the pauses)\n\t\tI needed to find you. The Ladder was\n\t\tmy baby.\n\nTears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with his sleeve. \nIt takes him a moment to regain his composure. JACOB is shivering. \nMICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it over JACOB, and leads him to \nthe wooden planks overhanging the water. They sit and gaze at the \nJERSEY SHORE.\n\n\nCUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tI always suspected the effects might\n\t\tcome back. That's why I had to follow\n\t\tyou. I had a hell of a time getting\n\t\thold of your records.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIf you knew, why didn't you say\n\t\tanything?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tThe truth can kill, my friend. Five\n\t\thundred men died out there. This\n\t\tisn't a story they'd ever want out.\n\t\tWhen Paul's car blew up I realized\n\t\tthe scope of the thing. I knew they\n\t\tmeant business.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSo why tell me now?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tBecause I can get rid of the demons.\n\t\tI can block the Ladder. I have an\n\t\tantidote. We can kill them off,\n\t\tchemically speaking. They'll all\n\t\tdisappear. It's chemistry, my friend.\n\t\tI know. I created it. Come with me. I\n\t\tcan help.\n\n\nINT.  HOTEL - DAWM\n\nJACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks, obviously \nfrequented by a gay clientele. JACOB is uncomfortable as they check in. \nMICHAEL, however, seems to know the ropes. They go to a small room.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou come here often?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tSometimes. When it's convenient.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow do I know this isn't just some\n\t\tkind of, you know, seduction or\n\t\tsomething?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tHey, I'm not the problem. You've got\n\t\tbigger problems than me.\n\nMICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI came up with the formula back in\n\t\tNam but I never got a chance to use\n\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNever?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tI'd hoped I'd never have to. Just\n\t\topen your mouth and stick out your\n\t\ttongue.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tDon't worry. Take it. It'll free your\n\t\thead. Come on.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(fearful)\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\"Yea though I walk through the valley\n\t\tof the shadow of death I shall fear\n\t\tno evil,\" but no one ever said I\n\t\twouldn't be shittin' in my pants\n\t\tevery step of the way, huh?\n\t\t\t(JACOB smiles, his mouth\n\t\t\topen)\n\t\tStick out your tongue.\n\t\t\t(JACOB obeys as an\n\t\t\teyedropper deposits a\n\t\t\tdrop of liquid on the\n\t\t\tback of his tongue)\n\t\tThat'a boy. Now why don't you just\n\t\tlie down and relax.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOne drop?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tIt's strong stuff.\n\nJACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and \nexamines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters \nerode the surface. It is an alien terrain.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI think I'm falling asleep.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tPleasant dreams.\n\nThe words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but \ncan't. He's frightened.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI can't move.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tJust relax.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's happening? Help me.\n\nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses \ntear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in \nhorror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. \nPiercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and \npointed claws clamor to break through.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHELP ME!\n\nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial \nwith the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds \nit over JACOB's mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tTake it!\n\nJACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the \neyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but \ncan't.\n\nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break \noff and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on \nthe DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the \nceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDon't fight it. It's your own mind.\n\t\tIt's your own fears.\n\nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a \nwar in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. \nIt builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's \neyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is \nbecoming a dark liquid void.\n\nGradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense \nto the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear \nand sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing \nupward, toward the surface.\n\nWith the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks \nthrough. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on \nshimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty \nthat they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light \nreach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a \nvision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.\n\nA sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL \nstanding before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to \nradiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly \nblinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tSo, how you doin'?\n\nThe casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To \nhis shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM. \nMICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally \ndisoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything \nin. He doesn't speak.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIt was better than you expected, huh?\n\nJACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh. \nIt is a huge laugh, full of energy and life.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd no more demons. I told you they'd\n\t\tbe gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't believe this. It's a miracle,\n\t\tMichael. A miracle.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tBetter living through chemistry,\n\t\tthat's my motto.\n\n\nEXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY\n\nJACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE. \nIt is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB \nstares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys \nJACOB's happiness.\n\n\nEXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY\n\nJACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt was paradise, Michael. You showed\n\t\tit to me. You were there.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tWell that's good to know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMike, it was real. It was glorious.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tGlorious. I'm not surprised. I fed\n\t\tyou enough of that stuff to send a\n\t\thorse to heaven. I'm just glad you\n\t\tcame back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI would have stayed there if I could.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tI'm sure. You've got nothing but\n\t\ttroubles waitin' for you here.\n\nHe points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(taking JACOB's arm)\n\t\tCome on.\n\n\nEXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY\n\nThe TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY \nPARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of \ncredit cards and hands one to JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tHere. I've got every credit card ever\n\t\tprinted. Take this. Stay here till\n\t\tyou can arrange to get away. It's on\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. I couldn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tWhat? You want the Plaza? Don't be\n\t\tfoolish. Here. Take this, too.\n\t\t\t(he pulls out a business\n\t\t\tcard)\n\t\tThis is my place on Prince Street.\n\t\tIt's got my phone, everything. Call\n\t\tif you need me ... but you won't.\n\t\tEverything's gonna work out. You just\n\t\tget outta town as fast as you can.\n\t\tThe New York police can be effective\n\t\twhen they want to be.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know what to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tSave the words ... Just send back my\n\t\tcredit card.\n\nMICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.\n\n\nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\nJACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE. He is \nsprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door. He \njumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing there. She looks at JACOB \nquizzically. He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the \nroom.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat are you doing here? Are you all\n\t\tright? How do you expect to pay for\n\t\tthis?\n\t\t\t(JACOB smiles)\n\t\tEveryone's looking for you, Jake. I\n\t\tdodged people all over the place,\n\t\treporters, police. I don't know what\n\t\tyou're gonna do.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm gonna make love to you. That's\n\t\twhat I'm gonna do.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tAre you out of your mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYep. Finally. I love you, Jez.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tGod, I can't keep up with all your\n\t\tchanges.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tMe neither.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat's gotten into you?\n\nJACOB grins.\n\nCUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one another. For \nall his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the events of the preceding day. \nWhile stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on \ntop of him and shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.\n\nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTIME CUT:\n\n\nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V. watching a \nromantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's amazing, you know, that a drug\n\t\tcould change things like that,\n\t\tdestroy a life and then give it back.\n\t\tIt's hard to believe that the world\n\t\tcould be so hellish on day and like\n\t\theaven the next.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI tell you, it was so wonderful. I\n\t\tfelt like a little boy. I saw\n\t\tParadise, Jezzie.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's so hard to believe.\n\nThere is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe. JEZZIE jumps \nunder the sheets.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho's there?\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLBOY (V.O.)\n\t\tIt's your dinner, sir.\n\nJEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY wheels in a \ntable set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of the room. JEZZIE jumps \nout of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals \nexcitedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThis is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever\n\t\tsince I was a little girl. I never\n\t\tthought it would happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tStick with me, kid.\n\nJEZZIE smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTIME CUT:\n\n\nDISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window overlooking \nGRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI want to go with you, Jake. Wherever\n\t\tyou go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's not practical, Jez. It'll be\n\t\thard enough alone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI can waitress. I'm good.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. Things are too hot. Later. I'll\n\t\tsend for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tBullshit!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI promise.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tPlease.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the\n\t\tonly one left. I don't want to expose\n\t\tyou to that. It's not right for you\n\t\tor me. Be reasonable.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tReasonable? Reasonable? Jake ...\n\t\tYou're gettin' me angry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI love you when you're angry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tOh yeah?\n\t\t\t(her eyes twinkle\n\t\t\tsuggestively)\n\t\tTry leavin' without me.\n\nJACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes \nhim onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their \nclothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be.\n\n\nOMIT\n\n\nINT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY\n\nJACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around \nhim. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in \nline. The TICKET SELLER looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tChicago. One way. For tomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\tSELLER\n\t\tHow many?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOne.\n\n\t\t\t\tSELLER\n\t\tThat'll be $119.75.\n\nJACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he \nis waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare \nunsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and \nhurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is \nfollowing him.\n\n\nINT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY\n\nJACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops \nhis pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices \na wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It \nis moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the \nhole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an \neye staring back at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it!\n\t\t\t(he covers it with his\n\t\t\thand. A pencil jabs his\n\t\t\tpalm. He yells)\n\t\tFucking pervert.\n\nTwo lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDream on!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(shocked)\n\t\tWhat?!\n\nThe mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running \nfrom the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the \nMEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them.\n\n\nINT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY\n\nJACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the \nmain doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the \ncorridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN \ndisappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for \nbreath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something \nand seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.\n\n\nOMIT\n\n\nINT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING\n\nJACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy, \nindustrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name \npainted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no \nanswer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head \nsticks out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tYou lookin' for Mike?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(panting hard)\n\t\tWhere is he?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tDon't know. Hasn't picked his mail up\n\t\tin days. It's not like him.\n\nJACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase \nand sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four \nand lunges at the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nJACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock \nflies open.\n\n\nINT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING\n\nJACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The \nLOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to \nroom. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass \nvials and bottles are shattered on the floor.\n\nJACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their \nlabels mean nothing to him.\n\nHe reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from \nthe bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face. \nIt is smiling.\n\nA scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen. \nJACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is \nlying sprawled across the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tOh my God!\n\nJACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved \npanic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and \nthree stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street.\n\n\nEXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT\n\nJACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast \nas his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the \nside of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs \nfor the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is \nas though he is trying to merge with the wall.\n\nSuddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding \ntoward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark \nnight. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to \nstop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB \nstares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to \npull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.\n\n\nINT.  TAXI - NIGHT\n\nRain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(barely audible)\n\t\tI'm going to Brooklyn.\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\tSorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I\n\t\tget lost in Brooklyn.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI know the way.\n\nJACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill, \nand hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook, this is all the money I've got\n\t\tin the world. Take me home and it's\n\t\tyours.\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\t... Where's your home?\n\nCUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the BROOKLYN \nBRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving through dark BROOKLYN \nSTREETS.\n\nJACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time he is \nbathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in him is falling \naway.\n\n\nEXT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nJACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAH'S \nAPARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n\t\tDr. Singer. It's been a long time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(greeting him warmly)\n\t\tHello, Sam.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n\t\t\t(noticing JACOB's\n\t\t\tbattered condition)\n\t\tAre you all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n\t\tDo you want some help? I can call\n\t\tupstairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo, don't. But thanks.\n\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nJACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand \nunderneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key. \nHe inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. He calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello. It's me.\n\n\nINT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSome lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?\n\t\tDaddy's here.\n\nThere is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into the dark \nLIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one is around. A photo of \nJACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is sitting on the counter. He picks it up \nand carries it with him through the apartment. He walks into his old \nBEDROOM and then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There \nis no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and turns away \nin disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He is about to switch the \nlights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall. He calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSarah, is that you? I hope you don't\n\t\tmind. I needed to come home.\n\nJACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem he \nusual self. She appears larger, more imposing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHello, Jake. I knew you'd come here\n\t\tin the end.\n\nJACOB is nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat're you ... ? Where's Sarah?\n\t\tWhere are the boys?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSit down, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere are they?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSit down.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo! What's going on? Where's my\n\t\tfamily?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's over, Jake. It's all over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere have they gone?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWake up. Stop playing with yourself.\n\t\tIt's finished.\n\nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. The edge of \nher coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. It is an \ninnocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into \nsomething else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing.\n\nJACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are \nshaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's going on?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYour capacity for self-delusion is\n\t\tremarkable, Dr. Singer.\n\nJEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him. \nSomething about her walk is very unnatural. JACOB eyes her fearfully.\n\nIn the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly strange and \nelusive. We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only \nto reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room. \nJACOB spins around, confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face, \nalthough it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. Her \nmovements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat's wrong, Jake?\n\t\t\t(she mocks him)\n\t\tForget to take your antidote?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho are you? What are you doing to me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou have quite a mind, Jake. I loved\n\t\tyour friends. That chemist - the\n\t\tLadder. What an imagination you have!\n\nJACOB freezes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd your vision of paradise ...\n\t\tfantastic! You're a real dreamer, you\n\t\tknow that? Only it's time to wake up.\n\nJEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the sounds of \nflapping wings remain. They grow louder and more menacing, whooshing \npast him with no visible source.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYour mind is crumbling, Jake. No more\n\t\t\"army.\" No more conspiracies. You're\n\t\tdying, Dr. Singer. It's over.\n\nJACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out. \"JEZZIE\" \nlaughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhere's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?\n\nJACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWHO ARE YOU?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHow many times have you asked me\n\t\tthat? How many times?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tTELL ME, DAMN YOU!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(with consummate power)\n\t\tYOU KNOW WHO I AM.\n\nJEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures her and it \nseems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she \nturns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so \noften before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, \ndark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in \nconstant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the \nessence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by \nconfusion. He is rooted in fear.\n\nA sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair \nstraight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can \nbarely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound \nreturns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness \nitself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(whispering to himself)\n\t\tThis isn't happening.\n\nNew terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, \nand sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and \nexplode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction \nare closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the \nmelee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.\n\nSuddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a \ndistance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands \nmotionless.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n\t\tIf you're frightened of dying you'll\n\t\tsee devils tearing you apart. If\n\t\tyou've made your peace then they're\n\t\tangels freeing you from the world.\n\nThe voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then \nthe sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever. \nHideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, \nfriends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.\n\nJACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the \nsounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder \nthey become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a \ngreat resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins \nmoving toward it.\n\nNEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him \nback, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the \ncreature.\n\nIn the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls \nback and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic \nregularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, \nwith deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence. \nIt is alive, angry, and threatening.\n\nThe CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of \nmadness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable \nfury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it.\n\nAS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its \nfeatureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into \nemptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.\n\nWith superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like \ngrabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably \nlike a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does \nnot let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles \ndefiantly with the monster.\n\nSuddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tWHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!\n\nJACOB does not respond. It cries out again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tWHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE\n\t\tFIGHTING?\n\nDeep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a \nform, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks \nbriefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human \nface. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask.\n\nJACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nDEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from \nbeneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the \nbattlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It \ntakes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one \nof terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time \nas a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating \nsadness.\n\nAs that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of \ncatacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before \nus, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room, \nJEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of \nblinding intensity.\n\nWe are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly \nchanging field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people \nin them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some \nways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with \nlife and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some \nof the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some \nwe have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why \nthey have been recalled.\n\nA newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes \noff a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida \nsurf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play \ncards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of \nan oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, \nlistening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her \nblouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake \nthat topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks \"Love me a \nlittle?\"\n\nAnd then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful \nsoothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself \nsitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first \nrays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. \nSomething about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits \nmotionless, stunned to be back there.\n\nThe faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is \nwarm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for \na few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets \nup and approaches the corridor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello?\n\nThere is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a \nmoment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWho is it? Who's there?\n\nTentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see \nthe outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. \nHis eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment \nregistering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same \nmusical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at \nhis father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGabe? Gabe!\n\nJACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him \nin a rush of love and emotion.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...\n\nThey hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the \nstiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder \nin a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an \ninstant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand \nand gently encourages him to stand up.\n\nWith a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.\n\nSunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first \nlanding. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing, \nhe too is surrounded by the comforting light.\n\nGABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is \nstunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. \nSquinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of \nthe light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with \nexcitement.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\tCome on Dad ... You know what we've\n\t\tgot? A sandbox just like the\n\t\tWilliston's, only it's bigger and the\n\t\tsand's all white. You won't believe\n\t\tit.\n\nJACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total \neuphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tGABE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd my parakeet. Remember, the one\n\t\tgrandma let out of the cage? He's\n\t\tokay. And he's talking now. He knows\n\t\tmy name.\n\nGABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the \nintenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS on the image. For a brief but \nstunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase \nshimmering before us. It rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the \nbrilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen.\n\nSuddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. It holds \nfor a second and then flashes off. An overhead surgical lamp remains \nstubbornly in view.\n\n\nINT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nA DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask. His \nexpression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are simple and \nfinal.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\tHe's gone.\n\nCUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD \nTENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely pulls a green \nsheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws up \nhis hands in defeat.\n\nAN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES \nfighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen door \nto let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh morning. The sun is \nrising.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\"JACOB'S LADDER\" (DELETED SCENES)\n\nby\n\nBruce Joel Rubin\n\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 1:  PROFESSOR STERN\n\n--\n\n\nINT.  CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY\n\nCUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE. It \nis almost empty. No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near \nthe front of nearly three hundred seats. All are listening to \nPROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tThus at the core of today's discu-\n\t\tsion we find four fundamental doc-\n\t\ttrines. First, that the world of\n\t\tmatter and individual consciousness\n\t\tare both manifestations of one Divine\n\t\tReality.\n\nOne of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding \nhis head.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tEven you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it,\n\t\tas amazing as that may seem.\n\nMR. PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tSecond, human beings are capable not\n\t\tonly of kowledge about this Divine Re-\n\t\tality by inference but can realize\n\t\tits existence by direct intuition,\n\t\tsuperior even to reason.\n\nA door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. JACOB \nenters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range \nof the professor.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tThird, man possesses a double nature,\n\t\tan ego and an eternal self, what we\n\t\tcall \"spirit\" or \"soul.\"\n\nJACOB takes a seat at one of the desks. There is a pencil lying \non it which he fingers distractedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tFourth, and most important, man's\n\t\tlife on earth has only one end and\n\t\tpurpose, to learn to let go of the\n\t\tseparate ego and to identify with the\n\t\tDivine spark within.\n\nMR. PALMER is nodding off again.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tAlmost impossible to believe, isn't\n\t\tit Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that\n\t\tunconscious head of yours lies the\n\t\tsource of all consciousness?\n\n\t\t\t\tPALMER\n\t\tYes, Sir. Very hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(nodding his head)\n\t\tWell now, having reached this\n\t\tapotheosis there seems little, if\n\t\tanything, left to say. So rather than\n\t\ttry, you are dismissed.\n\nThe STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden \ndismissal. They quickly gather their books and begin the long \nclimb to the exits. Only JACOB remains seated.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello Prof.\n\nPROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds \nbefore recognizing him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tMy oh my. Doctor Singer. Isn't this a\n\t\thappy surprise?\n\nJACOB comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old \nPROFESSOR.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(looking at JACOB's uni-\n\t\t\tform)\n\t\tAre you in the service?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThe postal service. I'm a mailman.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(surprised but non-\n\t\t\tjudgemental)\n\t\tAh. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark\n\t\tof night ... I always admired that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tIt's good to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tLikewise.\n\n\nEXT.  CITY COLLEGE - DAY\n\nJACOB AND PROFESSOR STERN walk down the city streets that \nconstitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tAnd how is your wife? Sarah, no?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(shrugging his shoul-\n\t\t\tders)\n\t\tI haven't seen her in months.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(understanding)\n\t\tAh!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm with another woman now. We're\n\t\tboth with the post office, Midtown,\n\t\t34th Street branch.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tHmm. I don't suppose there are too\n\t\tmany philosophers in the post office?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh, you'd be surprised. They just don't\n\t\thave their doctorates, that's all.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(he smiles)\n\t\tLast I heard you were offered a posi-\n\t\ttion in the West somewhere. Tuscon\n\t\twas it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh, that goes way back. They had a\n\t\thiring freeze, one of those last min-\n\t\tute things. Bad timing for me though.\n\t\tMiddle of the war. The draft.\n\t\t\t(STERN nods his head.\n\t\t\tThey walk a moment in\n\t\t\tsilence)\n\t\tI'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam\n\t\t... I didn't want to think anymore. I\n\t\tdecided my brain was just too small\n\t\tan organ to comprehend this chaos.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(looking at JACOB with\n\t\t\taffection)\n\t\tJacob, if it was any other brain but\n\t\tyours, I might agree.\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tTell me, does your lady friend know\n\t\twhat a brilliant thinker, what a sub-\n\t\tlime intellect she's living with?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(smiling coyly)\n\t\tI doubt it's my mind that interests\n\t\ther. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery\n\t\tlady.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(with a fatherly\n\t\t\tdemeanor)\n\t\tWell, try not to get burned. You have\n\t\ta great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone\n\t\ttempt you away from it.\n\n\nINT.  OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\nJACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table in a \nnearly empty coffee shop. They are both fixing cups of tea, not \nspeaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI've got a problem, Prof. More Augus-\n\t\ttine than Kierkegaard, if you know\n\t\twhat I mean.\n\t\t\t(STERN looks at him\n\t\t\tquestioningly)\n\t\tI need to know about ... demons.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(surprised)\n\t\tDemons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you\n\t\twriting ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo.\n\t\t\t(he pauses a moment)\n\t\tI see them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tSee them?\n\t\t\t(he smiles uncomforta-\n\t\t\tbly)\n\t\tWhat do you mean? Physically?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(hesitantly)\n\t\tYes.\n\nSTERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is \nunsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tI know very little about demons, Ja-\n\t\tcob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them\n\t\tas literary figures, biblical ones\n\t\t... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tthis is the 20th Century. We don't\n\t\tsee demons now.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're\n\t\tinvading my life.\n\nA look of concern fills STERN's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tChrist, I know how it sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tHave you considered a doctor? A psy-\n\t\tchiatrist?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(suddenly uneasy)\n\t\tI don't want them. I'm not looking\n\t\tfor analysis or drugs. It's too easy\n\t\tto dismiss as some kind of psychosis.\n\t\t\t(he pauses uncomforta-\n\t\t\tbly)\n\t\tIt's more than that. I can feel it. I\n\t\tneed you Prof. You're the only one I\n\t\tcan talk to.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tI don't know what to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI need your insight, your intuition.\n\nSTERN sips his tea slowly. He is thinking.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tDemons? I don't know what to tell\n\t\tyou. It sounds like a spiritual mat-\n\t\tter to me. The problem, Jacob, is\n\t\tthat you have no context for it.\n\t\tYou're a renegade Existentialist suf-\n\t\tfering demons a hundred years after\n\t\tFreud. How the hell am I supposed to\n\t\tmake it fit?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes\n\t\tsense.\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tPlease help me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\t\t(trying to be delicate)\n\t\tJacob, I don't believe in demons, not\n\t\tin the empirical sense. I don't be-\n\t\tlieve in devils fighting for our\n\t\tsouls. I don't believe in enternal\n\t\tdamnation. I don't believe in other-\n\t\tworldly creatures tormenting us. We\n\t\tdon't need them. We do a good enough\n\t\tjob on ourselves.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(disturbed)\n\t\tBut I see them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tLook. I don't pretend to know what's\n\t\tgoing on inside your head. For all I\n\t\tknow it's pathological and they\n\t\tshould be pumping Valium into your\n\t\tveins by the quart. But if you're not\n\t\twilling to accept the help of sci-\n\t\tence; and believe me, I admire you\n\t\tfor that: then you'll have to do bat-\n\t\ttle on your own. What can I say? It's\n\t\ta lonely pilgrimage through our times\n\t\teven for the strongest souls. But to\n\t\tbe pursued by ... demons no less ...\n\t\tThere are no guides, Jacob.\n\t\t\t(he muses)\n\t\tYou wanna know what I'd do if I sud-\n\t\tdenly started seeing demons? I'd hail\n\t\tthe first taxi that came along, shoot\n\t\tover to Bellvue and beg them for\n\t\tshock treatment. I'm no saint.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHell, you think I am?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTERN\n\t\tI'venever understood you, you know\n\t\tthat? You were by far the best pupil\n\t\tI've ever had, bar none. Intellectu-\n\t\tally, you were the most original, the\n\t\tmost imaginative. Who knows, maybe\n\t\tyou've been \"elected\" to see demons.\n\t\tMaybe you're in touch with ... some-\n\t\tthing. Nothing would surprise me\n\t\tabout you Jacob. Nothing.\n\nJACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in \nhis eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down \nhis cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly. \nSTERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S\n\n---\n\nSuddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him. \nThe DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three-\ndimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to \ntheir bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like \nexotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New \nappendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins \nprotrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down \ntheir legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the \nundersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a \nbiological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of \nlife, creatures of another world.\n\nCUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He \nstares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of \ntheir normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has \ngrown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her \ntongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth \nrepeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in \ntheir gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release \nhim.\n\nJACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from \nthem but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become \nspastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of \nthe other DANCERS.\n\nA circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends \nthe boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic \ndisplay. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of \nexorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and \nhis mind.\n\nCUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the \nAPARTMENT fade away.\n\n\nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n\nStrange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, \noutlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large \ncloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe's burning up.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTotal delirium.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe'll never make it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's some gash. His guts keep\n\t\tspilling out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tPush 'em back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(crying weakly)\n\t\tHelp me!\n\nHis eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it \nfilling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw \nus forward with a quickening intensity that grows into \nexhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash \nstroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of \ncolor. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be \nheard in the distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI think we're losing him.\n\nSuddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a \nkind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions. \nAs we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image \nis so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp \nwhat is being seen.\n\nMusic can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its \nbeauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a \nheartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of \nthe STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense \nflashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches \na thundering crescendo. Then silence.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 3: JACOB'S LIVING ROOM\n\n---\n\nINT.  JACOB'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nCUT TO APPLAUSE from a real television game show as JACOB \nswitches channels on the LIVING ROOM T.V. He stops on an \ninterview program, turns up the sound, and runs to the BATHROOM. \nThe CAMERA stays on the television. JACOB can be heard urinating \nin the distance.\n\nMAC HAYES, a young, virile, and smug REPORTER is speaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAYES\n\t\tThe Reverend Norman Murphy, leader of\n\t\tone of the largest groups supporting\n\t\tthe Armageddon Committee, told our\n\t\tcameras that we are no longer dealing\n\t\tin decades but years.\n\nTHE REVEREND fills the T.V. screen.\n\n\t\t\t\tMURPHY\n\t\tThe battleground is being readied.\n\t\tOur planet is the battlefield. Our\n\t\tsouls are the prize. All the signs\n\t\tpoint to the inevitable confrontation\n\t\tbetween the forces of good and evil.\n\t\tPeople must choose sides. There is no\n\t\tdraft evasions in this war. All are\n\t\tcalled. All must take up weapons. Are\n\t\tyou prepared? That's the question we\n\t\task.\n\nThe toilet flushes and JACOB walks back into the LIVING ROOM and \nturns down the sound.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAYES\n\t\tDo you find people scoffing at you,\n\t\tReverend? After all, there have been\n\t\tdoomsayers for thousands of years and\n\t\twe're still here.\n\n\t\t\t\tMURPHY\n\t\tPeople are less apt to laugh these\n\t\tdays. The prophecies are too close\n\t\tfor comfort. I mean, all you have to\n\t\tdo is watch the news.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAYES\n\t\tThere are some who claim that your\n\t\tpessimism is defeatist and what the\n\t\tworld needs now is hope, a positive\n\t\tthrust.\n\n\t\t\t\tMURPHY\n\t\tI think the time for hope has passed.\n\t\tThe seeds have been planted. We shall\n\t\treap what we've sown.\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tPessimists, no. I think we are\n\t\tpercieved as the only realists\n\t\taround.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAYES\n\t\tOther movement leaders agree. In an\n\t\tinterview ...\n\nSuddenly the telephone rings. It startles JACOB. He jumps. It \nrings again. He reaches down, turns off the T.V., and picks up \nthe phone. His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he \ntalks.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 4: JACOB'S BEDROOM\n\n---\n\nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nTHE BEDROOM is dark. JACOB and JEZZIE are making love. A half-\nsmoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. JEZZIE is \npoised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face.\n\nA hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. Its \nflickering light plays games with JACOB's eyes and for a moment \nJEZZIE seems to disappear. JACOB reaches out for her breasts and \nhis hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her. \nWith sudden, hallucinogenic impact, JACOB feels himself drawn \ninto a starry universe opening from inside her.\n\nTHE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and \nrushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. Pulsations of its \nlight whiten the screen. Out of the whiteness appears a momentary \nflash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, accompanied by sounds of sexual \nclimax.\n\nThe STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. The \nsparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIE's eye as her face fills the \nscreen. She looks especially lovely and radiant. Her image moves \nwith the lamplight.\n\nJACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in \nJEZZIE's glow. Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSo tell me ... am I still an angel?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(smiling broadly)\n\t\tWith wings.\n\t\t\t(he strokes her hair)\n\t\tYou transport me, you know that? You\n\t\tcarry me away.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 5: DEMON IN THE WALL\n\n---\n\nINT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nJACOB is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room. He is \nreading. The room is dark, lit only by a reading light. The walls \nare mostly in shadow. The light, however, falls on one section of \nthe wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling.\n\nJACOB's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood \ngrain on the wall. All of a sudden he notices something strange, \nan image in the grain. He stares at it. The more he stares the \nmore precise its definition. The image of a DEMON appears in the \nwall.\n\nJACOB sits up quickly and stares at the walll. It is impossible \nto get the DEMON's image out of the grain. It seems etched, even \nimbedded, in the paneling.\n\nJACOB looks away and returns to his book. He is reading about \narchetypes and the primordial mind. But the book does not hold \nhis attention. He is obsessed with the wall. Its molecules seem \nsuddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate. Layers begin to \nappear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly \ndefine a rocky, barren landscape.\n\nThe DEMON is growing solid. Cries and screams rise up in the \ndistance. Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending \nrapidly into the wall. The image of Hell erupts before him.\n\nJACOB stands up. He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall, \nmasses of PEOPLE wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery \nworld. The DEMON's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall \nand reaches into the room. He is huge, covered in flames and \nskulls, a living horror. He grabs hold of JACOB and pulls him \ntoward the wall. JACOB tries to back away but he cannot. His face \nis white with fear. The DEMON draws JACOB toward the inferno.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(yelling at the top of\n\t\t\this lungs)\n\t\tNO!\n\nSuddenly JEZZIE appears, the light from the BEDROOM flooding the \npaneled wall. The DEMON vanishes instantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake, are you all ... ?\n\nShe stops dead in her tracks.\n\nCUT TO JACOB pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and \nlogic, as though about to merge with the solid surface. His body \nholds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor. JEZZIE \ngoes to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake? Jake?\n\nHe doesn't answer. He looks at JEZZIE with a blank stare. His \nbody begins shaking.\n\n\nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nJACOB is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose. JEZZIE is \nstroking his hair and trying to calm him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's going to be all right, Jake.\n\t\tIt's going to be all right. Don't be\n\t\tafraid. I've got you now.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHold me, Jezzie. Hold me.\n\nJEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with \nher own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice \nJEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely \nlike a snake's.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL\n\n---\n\nThe RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two \nORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate \non the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within \nmoments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with \nastonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into \nthree-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK \nCHAMBER that was not there before.\n\nOut of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like \nDEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly \nseveral of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They \nlook like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional \nhospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space \nwhere the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes \nout.\n\n\nINT.  HELL - NIGHT\n\nThe DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by \nDEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles. \nJACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit \nup but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged.\n\nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are \nwaiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They \nare lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's \narms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is \nlifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him \nspread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God!\n\nThe DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. \nJACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires \nappear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's \nInferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one \nof countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own \nscreams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying.\n\nSuddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS \nemerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They \nsurround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. \nJACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of \nthe DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tJezzie! Help me!\n\nThe DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in \nhis suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each \nutterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere \nand compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The \nconfusion of meanings is a torment of its own.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM\n\n---\n\nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM\n\nJACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for \nhis back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look \nwell. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his \nback reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard \nvacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings \nopen. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His \neyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and \nseems insensitive to his presence.\n\nJEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits \nsomething. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a \ncan of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a \nsecond to understand the implications of what she has found. \nJACOB is ready when she begins yelling.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou're completely off your rocker,\n\t\tyou know that? You'd think you fell\n\t\ton your head instead of your back.\n\t\tWhat are you planning to do, burn\n\t\tdown the apartment along with your\n\t\tdemons?\n\nShe begins to remove the gasoline can.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tDon't you touch it.\n\t\t\t(he glares at her)\n\nJEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it \nfuriously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue \ndarting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human. \nJACOB freezes. He yells out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWho are you?\n\nThe sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells \nagain. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms \nout.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWho the hell are you?\n\nJEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on. \nJACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy won't you answer me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tCause you know goddamn well who I am.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI don't know you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou've lived with me for two years.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThat doesn't mean shit. Where do you\n\t\tcome from, huh? And I don't mean\n\t\tIndiana.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat do you want me to say? My\n\t\tmother's tummy?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou know goddamn well what I mean.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou're out of your fucking mind. I'm\n\t\tnot gonna stand around here gettin'\n\t\tinterrogated by you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWell leave then. Go to Hell.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(furious)\n\t\tYou son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think\n\t\tyou are? I don't deserve this. Who\n\t\ttakes care of you day and night? Who\n\t\tcleans the floor and washes your\n\t\tgoddamn underwear? Well, I've had it.\n\t\tYou flip out on your own, you\n\t\tungrateful bastard. I'm done holding\n\t\tyour hand. I don't want anything to\n\t\tdo with you, you hear? Nothing!\n\nShe storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she \ngoes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the \nbedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the \nopening along with a flood of tears.\n\nJACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall \ncloset and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can \nsee the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter \nas she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads \nto the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves.\n\nJACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He \nstares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly \nthe cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is \nmaterializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the \nextension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he \nbegins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the \nevolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder. \nPlaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting \nhard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops \nand stares at them with great intensity.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE\n\n---\n\nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge \ncrevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. \nHe stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the \nrupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the \ndarkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHELP ME!\n\nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the \nvial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid \nand holds it over JACOB's mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tTake it!\n\nJACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the \neyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, \nbut can't.\n\nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks \nbreak off and collide with one another like continental plates. \nThe collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and \ndismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a \nDevil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.\n\nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering \nlike a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing \ncatastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the \nceiling explodes.\n\nMatter atomizes instantly. Trillions of particles hurl \nchaotically in all directions. The walls shatter into a dazzling \nbrightness. For a moment there is a sense of intense forward \nmovement, a rush toward oblivion. And then, suddenly, it stops. \nThere is absolute quiet and stillness.\n\nJACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him. \nAll space has become a shining void. Gradually faint pastel \ncolors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning, \nredirecting space into new formations. They weave patterns of \nintricate complexity and stunning beauty.\n\nAs the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction \ngives way to solid form. A GARDEN SCENE emerges. It is a GARDEN \nOF LIGHT, a vast, almost mythic, Rousseau paradise. It radiates \nan intense shimmering light.\n\nJACOB's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him. A sudden \nmovement catches his attention. He looks up and notices MICHAEL \nstill standing beside him. MICHAEL, however, is rapidly changing \nform. It is a full, plastic, three-dimensional metamorphosis. His \nvery flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light. His \nface shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty.\n\nJACOB is nearly blinded by MICHAEL's presence and must shield his \neyes to look at him. MICHAEL smiles an extraordinary and joyous \nsmile that radiates such intense luminosity that JACOB has to \nsquint to see it.\n\nSuddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground. He rises into the air and \nfloats above JACOB. JACOB can barely breathe as he watches him. \nMICHAEL rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights. The \nlights shine on JACOB's head. He effervesces and shimmers in \ntheir glow.\n\nOne of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over JACOB. So \nintense is the light that JACOB grabs his eyes. As he opens them \nagain he sees that the GARDEN is fading back into pure light. \nMICHAEL, too, is fading.\n\nAnother burst of light and the GARDEN is reabsorbed by the void. \nOnly the brightness remains. It is many seconds before we realize \nthat the HOTEL ROOM is coming together, reconstructed by the \nlight. In moments it is fully formed. Sunlight is pouring through \nthe window. MICHAEL is sleeping lightly in a chair. He hears \nJACOB stare and sits up.\n\nJACOB is sitting on the bed. He does not seem to know where he \nis. His eyes are filled with awe. They move slowly around the \nroom, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. MICHAEL gets up and \nsits beside him. He respects his silence.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 9: HOTEL ROOM\n\n---\n\nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\nJACOB enters the HOTEL ROOM. JEZZIE is already there watching the \nevening news. She is still in her postal uniform, lying on the \nbed. She taps the mattress, inviting JACOB to lie next to her. A \nWOMAN is crying to a REPORTER on the T.V.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tIt's been four days. No word. It's\n\t\tnot like him. He's never done any-\n\t\tthing like this before. It's like he\n\t\tjust disappeared from the face of the\n\t\tearth.\n\n\t\t\t\tREPORTER\n\t\tThe Bureau of Missing Persons is con-\n\t\tfounded by the continuing surge of\n\t\treports ...\n\nJACOB snaps off the T.V.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat'd you do that for? It's an in-\n\t\tteresting story. All these people are\n\t\tstill disappearing. Right off the\n\t\tstreet.\n\t\t\t(staring at JACOB)\n\t\tHey, what's wrong? Are you all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm okay. I just don't want to lis-\n\t\tten.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou look upset.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tI'm not upset.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake, what is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm tired.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou look terrible. What happened?\n\t\t\t(he turns away. She\n\t\t\tstares at him for a mo-\n\t\t\tment, concerned)\n\t\tJake ... is it the antidote?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGoddamn it. Why do you say that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tLook at yourself. You look like\n\t\tyou've seen a ghost.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tShit! Can't I just have a bad day?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYou can have anything you want.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThen don't bug me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI'm not bugging you. Come and lie\n\t\tdown. I'll give you a massage.\n\t\t\t(she taps the mattress\n\t\t\tagain and JACOB joins\n\t\t\ther. She unbuttons his\n\t\t\tshirt)\n\t\tWhere'd you go today?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(evasively)\n\t\tMid-town mostly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tOh yeah? What was happenin' there?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(looking away from her)\n\t\tI picked up my ticket.\n\t\t\t(he pauses)\n\t\tI'm leaving in the morning, Jez.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(tensing)\n\t\tOh?\n\t\t\t(acting innocent)\n\t\tWhere you going?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(nervously)\n\t\tWest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(growing angry)\n\t\tWhere's West? New Jersey?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't be funny.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tI always liked the West, west of Il-\n\t\tlinois anyway. But you gotta give me\n\t\ttime to pack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tStop it, Jez. Don't do that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tDo what? I haven't done a thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't play games with me. There's\n\t\tnothing more to say.\n\nThere is a quiet rage building in JEZZIE's eyes as she continues \nto stroke JACOB's chest. He tries to relax and give himself over \nto the movement of her hand. Silently she leans over and begins \nlicking his stomach. JACOB's eyes close. His stomach hardens. He \nreaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head. Slowly, \nJEZZIE works her way back up to his chest. Her tongue darts in \nand out suggestively. He eyes are burning with anger. Her mouth \npoises itself over his nipple. She toys with it for a few seconds \nand then chomps down hard. The bite draws blood.\n\nJACOB screams. His eyes shoot open. For the flash of an instant \nhe sees a DEMON hovering over him, a hideous horned creature \nlicking his blood. JACOB flies off the bed as the creature hurls \nto the floor. JACOB is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it \nis JEZZIE lying at his feet. His head begins reeling. He backs \naway from the bed, not taking his eyes off JEZZIE for a second. \nHe backs to the closet and grabs his coat.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake. What are you doing? Look, I'm\n\t\tsorry, I didn't mean to bite. Let me\n\t\tget you a towel.\n\nJACOB grabs his wallet and his glasses. He backs toward the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake, don't. You can't leave. You're\n\t\tnot seeing things clearly. The drug's\n\t\twearing off.\n\nShe stands up and begins to approach him. JACOB lifts up a desk \nchair and holds it in front of him. Blood is running down his \nchest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tJake, don't leave me!\n\nJACOB throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries \ninto the HALLWAY. JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to \nthe door. She yells after him, but he is already gone.\n\n---\n\nADDENDUM 10: THE END OF THE MOVIE\n\n---\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nJACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand \nunderneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a \nkey. He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(calling out)\n\t\tHello. It's me.\n\n\nINT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad-\n\t\tdy's here.\n\nThere is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He walks into the \nLIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN. No one is around. He walks into \nhis old BEDROOM and then the BOYS' ROOM. He is surprised to hear \nfootsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tSarah, is that you? I hope you don't\n\t\tmind. I needed to come home.\n\nJACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem \nto be her usual self. She seems larger, more imposing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHello, Jake. I knew you'd come here\n\t\tin the end.\n\nJACOB is nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere's Sarah? Where are the boys?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSit down, Jake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere are they?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tSit down!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo! What's going on? Where's my\n\t\tfamily?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tIt's over, Jake. It's all over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhere have they gone?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWake up! Stop playing with yourself.\n\t\tIt's finished.\n\nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. Her \nlips snarl. Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is \nnot a nervous habit but a conscious act. JACOB's body feels the \nfirst waves of an inner tremor. His legs are shaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's going on?\n\nJEZZIE smiles at him. Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from \nher mouth beyond human extension. JACOB recoils.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(whispering to himself)\n\t\tThis isn't happening.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tYour capacity for self-delusion is\n\t\tremarkable, Dr. Singer.\n\nJEZZIE's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is \nsuffering from cramps. JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives \nbirth to pointed horns.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tWhat's wrong, Jake?\n\t\t\t(she mocks him)\n\t\tForget to take your antidote?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tGoddamn you!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(smiling and then\n\t\t\tlaughing)\n\t\tI loved your chemist, Jake. The\n\t\theight of fantasy. And your vision of\n\t\tparadise.\n\t\t\t(she laughs with a hu-\n\t\t\tmiliating tone)\n\t\tA most romantic creation. You're\n\t\tquite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time\n\t\tto wake up.\n\nJACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His \nbody is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his \nlegs barely move.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tThere is nowhere to run, Jacob.\n\t\tYou're home.\n\nSuddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster \nfrom the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the \ncarpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He \npulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss. \nJEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins \naround.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWHO ARE YOU?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\tHow many times have you asked me\n\t\tthat? How many times?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tTELL ME, DAMN YOU!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n\t\t\t(with consummate power)\n\t\tYou know who I am.\n\nSuddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all \nher might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With \neach yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself \ninside out before JACOB's eyes.\n\nThe emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence \nbeyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with \na thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is \nrodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns \nprotruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked \nclaws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a \nlong, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with \ndevastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air.\n\nA sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms \npenetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and \nspread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping \nis deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble \ndarkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The \nVOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The \nDEMON roars.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEMON\n\t\t\t(with JEZZIE's voice)\n\t\tStill love me, Jake?\n\t\t\t(it laughs and reaches\n\t\t\tout to him)\n\t\tCOME!\n\nCUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of \nrage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His \nwhole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano \nbefore it erupts.\n\nSuddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates \ninside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNO!!!!!\n\nWith a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the \nDEMON. JACOB is battling for his very soul and tears at the DEMON \nwith an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. Its giant \nwings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. JACOB \nkeeps fighting. He claws, bites, and rips at the wings, \ndecimating their delicate fabric.\n\nThe DEMON, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up \nthrough the last fragments of the ceiling. JACOB does not let go. \nThey burst into the fiery darkness. The room crumbles beneath \nthem and disappears into the void.\n\nThe abyss opens beneath them. JACOB continues his attack. His \nlegs are locked around the DEMON's waist. His hands dig into her \neyes. The DEMON shrieks and surges downward with awesome \nvelocity.\n\nThe DEMON charges into a rocky slope, smashing JACOB into its \ncliffs. JACOB claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he \ncan reach. The DEMON takes a huge chunk out of JACOB's arm. JACOB \nscreams, grabs a rock, and shatters the DEMON's teeth. The DEMON \nfalls to the ground. JACOB holds on.\n\nAll of a sudden the DEMON begins to shrink. JACOB is shocked and \nstruggles to contain it. As it dwindles in size it reorders its \nshape. Within seconds a powerful INSECT is cupped in his hands. \nJACOB tries to crush it but it stings with such force that \nJACOB's entire body recoils. The stinging persists. JACOB hurls \nhimself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the CREATURE \ndown. So massive is the INSECT's attack. however, that JACOB's \nwhole body heaves off the ground with each sting. Then the \nattacks subside. JACOB waits for the next blow.\n\nSuddenly JACOB's body shoots straight up. His hands fly apart as \na new life form erupts between them. He holds on tightly as flesh \nand blood mold and expand between his fingers. The new body takes \nrapid shape. It is a CHILD. JACOB grasps it with all his might as \nit completes its identity. He is horrified when he sees it. It is \nhis son.\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\tDaddy!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God!\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\tYou're hurting me!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tStop!!!!\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\tDaddy. Let go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat do you want from me?\n\n\t\t\t\tELI\n\t\tLET GO!\n\nJACOB does not let up. In an instant his SON explodes into a \ngelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. Within \nits translucent mass a new body is forming. JACOB stares at it \nwith growing terror. It is himself. A terrible perplexity fills \nJACOB's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image. \nHe recoils as his own voice calls out to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWho the Hell do you think you're\n\t\tfighting?\n\nThe words shock him and for the first time, he lets go.\n\nInstantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves \ninto an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. JACOB looks down \nat the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. Its surface \nreflects a smoky, unearthly light.\n\nJACOB gazes into the darkness. He is all alone. The quiet \noverwhelms him. The only sound is his own breath. He looks \naround, in all directions, but can see nothing. The CAMERA holds \non him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing \ncomes. He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. He \nstares at the terrible darkness.\n\nA subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath \nJACOB's feet. He steps away from it, but it follows his movement. \nSuddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames. \nJACOB screams and tries to run but the flames move with him, \nlapping at his legs. He cannot escape them. As far and as fast as \nhe runs the fire is with him. He yells and cries and screams as \nthe fire eats at his lower limbs. He falls and jumps back up \nagain, his hands charred. His eyes grow wild.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOh God, help me.\n\nInstantly the flames roar and engulf him. It is total \nconflagration. JACOB's skin blisters and turns black. His flesh \ncrackles. Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can \nfind no freedom from his suffering.\n\nAll at once JACOB stops running. He throws his hands up into the \nburning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. It is a \ngesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond \nhimself. His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly \nquiet inside him.\n\nThrough the flames JACOB's dark form can be seen as it slowly \nsits down, like a Buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust. \nHe appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate \nhim.\n\nGradually the fire dies. JACOB's body, his flesh like a charred \nand brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. An orange glow \nfrom the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the \nfinal darkness.\n\nThe SCREEN stays dark for as long as possible. Then, slowly, an \neerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. It backlights JACOB, \nrevealing his silhouette. The CAMERA dollies slowly toward him. \nIt approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of JACOB's \nface. It is the face of death. The CAMERA holds on the image.\n\nSuddenly, with shocking impact, JACOB's eyes move. Within the \ncrumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still \nconscious. The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings \nof a new light.\n\nIt is dawn. JACOB's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural \nglow. Slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. JACOB's \neyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in \nthe still dark lansdcape. Gradually the orbs begin their ascent \nlike a thousand suns rising at the same time. JACOB's eyes widen \nas his new world stands revealed. He is sitting in a GARDEN OF \nLIGHT, the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before.\n\nA sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. The \nvegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft \nglow. Like a gentle breeze MICHAEL descends from the light and \nstands radiant before JACOB. He smiles and the air itself seems \nto brighten. MICHAEL quietly approaches JACOB's body.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tI am with you, Jacob.\n\nJACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and \ndisbelief.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(speaking with a gentle\n\t\t\tcompassion)\n\t\tIt's all right now. It's over. You've\n\t\twon. You're here.\n\t\t\t(JACOB stares at him\n\t\t\tquestioningly. MICHAEL\n\t\t\treaches out his hands)\n\t\tTrust me.\n\nSoftly MICHAEL places his hands on top of JACOB's head and begins \nto peel at the charred flesh. Layer by layer he strips it away. \nThen, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section \nwith one quick pull. A BLAZE OF LIGHT bursts through the gaping \nhole in JACOB's head and beams into the air around them. It is an \nastounding sight.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tCome on. Don't make me do it all.\n\t\t\t(his eyes sparkle)\n\t\tStand up.\n\t\t\t(JACOB's eyes are burst-\n\t\t\ting with wonder)\n\t\tYou can do it.\n\nSlowly JACOB begins to stir. He moves feebly at first, like an \nold man. His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each \nsudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike \nintensity.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tStop hobbling. Your flesh can't hold\n\t\tyou anymore.\n\nJACOB nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. His \nlungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body \nas a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. JACOB \nstands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. His face is \nlike a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands, \nglowing with light.\n\nMICHAEL directs JACOB's vision to the sunrise. It is majestic, \nalmost Biblical in its grandeur. Great rays of light penetrate \nvast cloud formations and descend into the GARDEN. Slowly the \nclouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. A \nmassive light complex emerges from behind them. JACOB watches, \nawestruck, as the CELESTIAL STAIRWAY stands revealed. It reaches \ndown from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace. \nIt touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of \nteh GARDEN. JACOB's eyes are filled with its splendor. MICHAEL \nlooks at him and nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tGo on, Jacob. It has come for you.\n\nJACOB cannot speak. His eyes are fixed on the STAIRWAY dazzling \nhim from afar. He can see ANGELIC FORMS moving up and down it. \nSuddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself \nfloating up into the air. He looks down upon EDEN sparkling below \nhim. His mouth is wide open as he soars above it.\n\nThe light pulsating from the STAIRWAY is brilliant and thrilling. \nJACOB's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. The \nSTAIRWAY grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. It pulls \nJACOB toward it.\n\nSTREAMS OF ANGELS enter the STAIRWAY like a fast flowing river. \nIt carries them instantly within its current up beyond the \nvisible reaches of the glittering sky. Billowing clouds glow in a \nparade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the \nSTAIRWAY reaches beyond all known dimensions.\n\nJACOB stares at the light that is about to absorb him. It is a \nmoment of total euphoria. He surges into the stream as the \nbrilliant light of the STAIRWAY overwhelms the screen.\n\nSlowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller \nlight source. An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in \nview.\n\n\nINT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nA DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his \nmask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are \nsimple and final.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\tHe's gone.\n\nCUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY \nFIELD TENT in VIET NAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely \npulls a green sheet up over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of \nthe aides and throws up his hands in defeat.\n\nTWO ORDERLIES wheel JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and \nNURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back \na screen door to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh \nmorning. The sun is rising.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob's Ladder\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bruce Joel Rubin\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:27:58.582634"}
