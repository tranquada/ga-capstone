WOODS. DAY\n\n          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome\n          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans\n          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing\n          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.\n          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that\n          descends into the valley below.\n          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a\n          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears\n          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:\n\n                         FOX\n          What'd the doctor say?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-\n          four hour bug. He gave me some pills.\n\n                         FOX\n\n                         (REASSURINGLY)\n          I told you. You probably just ate some\n          bad gristle.\n          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They\n          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the\n          path. Fox points:\n\n                         FOX\n          Should we take the short cut or the\n          scenic route?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Let's take the short cut.\n\n                         FOX\n          But the scenic route is so much prettier.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n\n                         (SHRUGS)\n          OK, let's take the scenic route.\n\n                         FOX\n          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,\n          anyway.\n          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a\n          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her\n          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off\n          down the scenic route.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          2.\n\n          EXT. FARM. DAY\n\n          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and\n          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A\n          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from\n          the bushes outside a fence.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          What is a squab?\n\n                         FOX\n          You know what a squab is. It's like a\n          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of\n          bird we can eat.\n          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.\n\n                         FOX\n          Should we go through the hole under the\n          horse fence or climb the rail over the\n          bridle path?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a\n          little safer.\n\n                         FOX\n          But the bridle path puts us out right\n          next to the squab shack.\n          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods\n          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.\n\n                         FOX\n          What's wrong? I've never seen you like\n          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't\n          worry. I've been stealing birds for a\n          living since before I could trot.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n\n                         (SHRUGS)\n          OK, let's take the --\n\n                         FOX\n          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me\n          the scenic route already.\n          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:\n\n                         FOX\n          By the way, you look unbelievably\n          beautiful tonight. You're practically\n          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          3.\n          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She\n          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her\n          cheek.\n          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this\n          shot which can be literally lit from within.)\n          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and\n          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race\n          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window\n          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing\n          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond\n          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever\n          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and\n          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,\n          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely\n          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden\n          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a\n          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.\n          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his\n          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs\n          impatiently. They duck inside.\n          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in\n          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above\n          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his\n          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:\n\n                         FOX\n          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!\n          Look at this.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Get away from there.\n\n                         FOX\n          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...\n          (pointing to different spots)\n          I guess if you come from over there, and\n          you're standing at the door to the squab\n          shack, this little gadget probably\n          triggers the --\n          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)\n          Move out of the way, darling. That's\n          right where it's going to land.\n          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          4.\n          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly\n          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of\n          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox\n          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.\n\n                         FOX\n          No, it just falls straight down right\n          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-\n          loaded.\n          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,\n          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says\n\n                         QUIETLY:\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          I'm pregnant.\n          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.\n\n                         FOX\n          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,\n          that's great news!\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I\n          want you to find another line of work.\n          Pause. Fox nods.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,\n          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a\n          river running through the middle.\n\n                         TITLE:\n          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)\n\n          EXT. HOLE. DAY\n\n          The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with\n          holly bushes.\n\n          INT. HOLE. DAY\n\n          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two\n          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a\n          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the\n          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-\n          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at\n          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          5.\n          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,\n          Victorian-style dress.\n\n                         INSERT:\n          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of\n          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\n                         FOX\n          Does anybody actually read my column? Do\n          your friends ever talk about it?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n\n                         (STILL STIRRING)\n          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-\n          girlfriend just said to me last week, \"I\n          should read Foxy's column,\" but they\n          don't get the Gazette.\n          (yelling into the next room)\n          Ash! Let's get cracking!\n\n                         FOX\n          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.\n\n                         (SIGHS)\n          I want to say I hate my job, but that\n          would make it seem more important to me\n          than I want people to think it is.\n          Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of\n          bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the\n          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is\n          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.\n\n                         ASH\n          I'm sick.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          You're not sick.\n\n                         ASH\n          I have a temperature.\n          Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his\n          forehead.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          You don't have a temperature.\n          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:\n\n                         ASH\n          I don't want to go.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          6.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Hurry up. You're going to be late.\n          Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast\n          and coffee. Fox whispers to her:\n\n                         FOX\n          I love the way you handled that.\n          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first\n          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be\n          extra nice to him, because he's going\n          through a very hard time right now, OK?\n          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white\n          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into\n          them. He says aggressively:\n\n                         ASH\n          Where's he going to sleep?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          We're going to make a bed for him in your\n          room tonight.\n\n                         ASH\n          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's\n          study.\n          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:\n\n                         FOX\n          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.\n          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He\n          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:\n\n                         FOX\n          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.\n          It makes me feel poor.\n          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says\n\n                         SOFTLY:\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          We are poor -- but we're happy.\n          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          7.\n\n                         FOX\n          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are\n          better above ground.\n          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of\n          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:\n\n                         FOX\n          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My\n          father died at seven and a half. I don't\n          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm\n          going to do something about it.\n          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of\n          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands\n          and picks up his cup of coffee.\n\n                         FOX\n          Well, I'm off.\n          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on\n          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his\n          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts\n\n                         CHEERILY:\n\n                         FOX\n          Have a good day, my darlings!\n          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white\n          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his\n          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves\n          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks\n          puzzled.\n\n                         FOX\n          What's he wearing?\n          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves\n          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded\n          up section of his newspaper.\n\n                         INSERT:\n          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a\n          photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a\n          hill. A caption below it reads:\n          Tree Living, Great Views, Classic Beech\n\n          INT. TREE. DAY\n\n          A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There\n          is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          8.\n          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A\n          skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox\n          comes into the living room:\n\n                         WEASEL\n          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.\n          Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping\n          stone hearth --\n          Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox\n          peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick\n          tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.\n          Weasel snaps at him:\n\n                         WEASEL\n          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the\n          property. You're not supposed to be here.\n\n                         KYLIE\n          (checking his watch)\n          Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.\n           Weasel sighs.

He looks at Kristofferson in the\n          next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the\n          floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs\n          touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to\n          Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:\n\n                         ASH\n          How long is Kristofferson supposed to\n          stay with us?\n\n          MRS.

Double-pneumonia isn't\n          even really that big of a deal, is it?\n          In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts\n          practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the\n          doorway and whispers forcefully:\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to\n          be alive. Now --\n\n                         ASH\n          Right, but --\n          Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-\n          kick with a chop:\n\n                         KRISTOFFERSON\n          Ki-ya!\n          Everyone looks startled.

NIGHT\n\n          Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses\n          to sniff the air.

He falls over, out cold.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly\n          shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles\n          eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and\n          Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House\n          #1.

The master plan's working again!\n          Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an\n          unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they\n          weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance\n          to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.\n          Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,\n          and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights\n          jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.\n          The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie\n          emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead\n          chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:\n\n                         FOX\n          I said one bite, cuss it!\n\n                         KYLIE\n          I'm trying! I have a different kind of\n          teeth from you!

Farmhands\n          appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox\n          and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them.

He looks out and sees Boggis\n          opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,\n          barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox\n          shouts to Kylie:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          24.\n\n                         FOX\n          Holy cuss!

Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with\n          his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the\n          bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says\n\n                         BREATHLESSLY:\n\n                         FOX\n          Let's hit the five and dime on the way\n          home!

Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a\n          slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.\n          Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine\n          comes out of his nose.\n          Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7\n          carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands\n          run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole\n          cut into the electric fence.\n          Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C\n          carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands\n          run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole\n          knocked into a brick wall.\n          Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII\n          carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic\n          doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie\n          escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.\n          Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the\n          dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford\n          a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow\n          glade. They look exhilarated.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          25.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN. EVENING\n\n          Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a\n          wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a\n          dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around\n          its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.\n          Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back\n          out of the room.\n\n          MRS.

Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-\n          up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air\n          holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.\n\n                         KYLIE\n          What's that?\n\n                         ASH\n          This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won\n          for being an athlete.\n          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a\n          last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:\n\n                         FOX\n          I'm supposed to cover this book party at\n          some animal's nest in a tobacco field\n          down the hill, so me and Kylie are going\n          to hop over there and give it a whirl.\n          Don't wait up.\n          Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the\n          table, and stands up.

Fox and Kylie look around\n          the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from\n          behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped\n          shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his\n          mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.\n          He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.\n          He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.\n          He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck\n          of his cider jar.

They both dart away and\n          hide behind cider jars.\n          A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin\n          comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf\n          where Fox is hiding.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          30.\n\n                         HOUSEKEEPER\n          How many jars should I bring up, ma'am?\n          A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from\n\n                         UPSTAIRS:\n\n                         MASCULINE VOICE\n          I don't know. Two, I guess.\n          The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one\n          Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses\n          his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his\n          arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper\n          hesitates.\n\n                         HOUSEKEEPER\n          He drank three yesterday, ma'am.\n\n                         MASCULINE VOICE\n          All right, take three.\n          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar.

It's unhealthy. He's\n          anorexic. Bring two.\n          The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar. Fox relaxes slightly.\n          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar again.

A gunshot rings\n          out taking us to:\n\n          EXT. BEAN FARMS. NIGHT\n\n          Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts\n          from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken\n          light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce\n          sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,\n          staring at Bean.\n\n                         BEAN\n          I'm going to give a speech, and at the\n          end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist\n          into this plot.\n          Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the\n          porch.\n\n                         BEAN\n          First truth: this is the most ambitious\n          fox we've ever encountered, bar none.\n          Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis\n          and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          32.\n\n                         BEAN\n          Second truth: the meaning of ambition is\n          defined in the dictionary.\n          Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.\n\n                         BEAN\n          Third truth: the weakness of the\n          ambitious man is his Achilles heel --\n          Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his\n          back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes\n          dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two\n          colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:\n\n                         BEAN\n          -- but I've already figured out where\n          this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're\n          going to camp in the bushes, wait for him\n          to come out of the hole in his tree, and\n          shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that\n          grab you, fellas?\n          Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their\n          approval.\n\n          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT\n\n          Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed\n          in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Another book party?\n          Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool\n          in the darkened pantry.\n\n                         FOX\n          Woah!

Bean\n          licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the\n          wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to\n          Boggis and Bunce.\n\n          EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT\n\n          Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He\n          moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a\n          moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says\n\n                         STONILY:\n\n                         FOX\n          Nice job covering for me.

A\n          barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.\n          Silence.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          34.\n          Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.\n          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his\n          flashlight on Fox's hole.\n          In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-\n          stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it\n          in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.\n\n                         BEAN\n          We got the tail, but we missed the fox.\n          Pause.

NIGHT\n\n          Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with\n          gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox\n          cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:\n\n                         ASH\n          It'll grow back, won't it?\n\n                         KYLIE\n          (shaking his head)\n          Tails don't grow back, except for\n          lizards.\n\n                         FOX\n\n                         (MISERABLY)\n          Tails don't grow back.

FOX\n          You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up\n          with a proper apology.\n          Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares\n          straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:\n\n                         FOX\n          What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape\n          and the pants tucked into your socks?\n          Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging\n          his tail.

Kristofferson frowns. He takes off\n          his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity:\n\n                         KRISTOFFERSON\n          Don't do that.\n          Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson.

Beaver's\n          son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove.\n          Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as\n          Kristofferson puts his shoes back on.\n\n                         ASH\n          I can fight my own fights.\n          Badger and Fox stand facing each other at the end of the\n          tunnel.

Everyone watches him uncertainly. They\n          look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie\n          cuts him off sharply:\n\n                         KYLIE\n\n                         (SHARPLY)\n          Shh!\n          Badger falls silent.

His\n          paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and\n          shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of\n          the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the\n          others.

She nods. She hands Ash the\n          lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the\n          mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.\n          Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.\n\n                         FOX\n          Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a\n          very special direction.\n          Fox feels the walls with his paws.

Fox suddenly whistles\n          and raises his fist.\n          The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his\n          paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at\n          the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.\n          Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They\n          all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a\n          second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          50.\n          the gap.

NIGHT\n\n          Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis' Chicken House #1.\n          The room is teeming with chickens, which stare at them\n          nervously. There are black chickens, white chickens, brown\n          chickens, and one that combines all three colors.

FLINT-MINE. DAY\n\n          The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a\n          dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows\n          of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for\n          all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered\n          together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits,\n          skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned\n          with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the\n          piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune.\n          Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver.\n\n                         WEASEL\n          What am I going to do?

They tear into their meals, eating and\n          drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly\n          into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.\n          Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider\n          glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy\n          of eating.

Plus, we already knew who they\n          were because they're trying to kill us.\n\n                         INSERT:\n          A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and\n          pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:\n          Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you\n          ever want to see him alive again --\n          Ash calls out:\n\n                         ASH\n          I'm his son.\n          Everyone looks at Ash. He stands behind them in silhouette.\n          Rat says darkly:\n\n                         RAT\n          I can see the resemblance.\n          Pause. In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up\n          off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away\n          twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.\n          Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down\n          the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his\n          teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is\n          suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.\n          Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned\n          boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing\n          Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his\n          switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.\n          Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers\n          of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows\n          Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,\n          baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          63.\n\n                         RAT\n          I've still got it.\n\n                         FOX\n\n                         (FROWNING)\n          What'd you just say?\n\n                         RAT\n          I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.\n          She never asked for it back.\n          A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto\n          Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the\n          ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and\n          struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox\n          releases him.\n          Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next\n          to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:\n\n                         RAT\n          The boy's locked in an apple crate on top\n          of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean\n          Annex.

Blood drips from his mouth. His voice\n\n                         CREAKS:\n\n                         RAT\n          Never.\n\n                         FOX\n          (shaking his head)\n          All these wasted years. What were you\n          looking for, Rat?\n          Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters.\n\n                         ASH\n          He's trying to say something, Dad.\n          Fox leans his ear close to Rat's mouth. As quiet as a mouse,\n\n                         RAT WHISPERS:\n\n                         RAT\n          Cider.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          64.\n          Fox nods. He looks around the drainpipe. He cups his paw into\n          the pool of murky water and holds it to Rat's lips.\n\n                         FOX\n          Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's\n          finest secret cider.\n          Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste\n          of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:\n\n                         RAT\n          Like melted gold.\n          Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead.

Fox lays Rat gently onto\n          the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the\n          group.

Cobwebs hang from the\n          rafters below the sloped roof.\n          Kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking\n          out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on\n          top of a gun locker in the corner.

A\n          station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire\n          sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,\n          Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a\n          slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.\n          Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the\n          top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and\n          throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out\n          of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.\n          Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift\n          it open.\n\n                         INSERT:\n          Rat's watch.

A man with a dart in one\n          hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's\n          Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes\n          out.\n          The three farmers laugh smugly.

Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and\n          tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and\n          scramble in the confusion.\n          Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street.

Seven farmhands chase him down\n          a cobblestone lane.\n          Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and\n          start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The\n          beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands\n          chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.\n          Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps\n          into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a\n          paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity\n          lets out a little whoop.\n          There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from\n          the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle\n          with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.\n          Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with\n          a sidecar.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar.

Leaves rustle\n          on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys\n          wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories\n          tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its\n          courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean\n          Annex.\n          The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters\n          vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out\n          from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire\n          security barricade.\n\n                         FOX\n          That's the annex over there on the right.\n          Ash nods.

The gardener\n          puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his\n          bicycle.\n          Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come\n          out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the\n          gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys.

He picks the lock\n          and opens the doors.\n          The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,\n          there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a\n          compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,\n          broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,\n          fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.\n          White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.\n          Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck\n          reads Spitz.\n          Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens\n          his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.\n\n                         FOX\n          Give me a blueberry.\n          Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and\n          gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his\n          hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points\n          at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away\n          and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:\n\n                         ASH\n          What's that white stuff around his mouth?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          78.\n\n                         KYLIE\n\n                         (SQUINTING)\n          I think he eats soap.\n          Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above\n          some bags of fertilizer.

With rabies. I've heard about\n          this beagle.\n          The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:\n\n                         FOX\n          Easy, boy.\n          Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the\n          back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over\n          his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:\n\n                         FOX\n          I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel\n          like there's a tenderness in his eyes.\n          Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The\n          beagle watches him calmly.\n\n                         FOX\n           Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little\n          lonely, maybe, but --\n          Fox takes another cautious step.\n\n                         FOX\n          -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.\n          Is your name Spitz?

The pupils of the beagle's eyes\n          contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn\n          bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.\n          The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an\n          enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,\n          and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the\n          courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and\n          snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his\n          voice cracking like a grandmother's:\n\n                         FOX\n          Climb the trellis!\n          In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis\n          six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping\n          off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof\n          of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a\n          pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look\n          down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane\n          fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the\n          courtyard.\n          Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:\n\n                         FOX\n          So the attic is probably in the area\n          right up around here somewhere, I figure,\n          huh?\n          Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at\n          Fox vacantly.\n          (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's\n          vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)\n\n                         FOX\n\n                         (IRRITATED)\n          Come on, guys.

DAY\n\n          Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires\n          smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in\n          the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning\n          over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and\n          climb inside. They take off.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches\n          into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils,\n          Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an\n          image of a trapped fox.\n          An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black\n          moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped\n          uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and\n          start unloading stacks of metal cages.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being\n          pursued by the six farmhands.\n\n          INT.

There is a clanking sound from above.\n          Kristofferson looks up.\n          A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash\n          look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles\n          oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice:\n\n                         KRISTOFFERSON\n          Hi!\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room with three different-\n          colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist.\n          Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a\n          mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the\n          apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates.

The apple crate hits the floor\n          and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the\n          wreckage.\n          Ash looks over the side of the shelf.

He looks\n          quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner\n          and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into\n          the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:\n\n                         BADGER\n          Badoit et fils.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          84.\n          A cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and\n          disappears into the ground.

Her fur is wildly\n          dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She\n          looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says\n\n                         FIERCELY:\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Let's go!\n\n          EXT. YARD. DAY\n\n          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of\n          the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the\n          courtyard doors. They freeze.\n          The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's\n          helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its\n          rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front\n          of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.\n          Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His\n          jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:\n\n                         FOX\n          Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your\n          posse hunted my family. Your gunmen\n          kidnapped my nephew.

Fox smiles back defiantly.\n          Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:\n\n                         ASH\n          I weigh less than a slice of bread.\n\n                         FOX\n\n                         (HESITATES)\n          What?\n\n                         ASH\n          I'll be right back.\n          Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as\n          Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers\n          open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take\n          cover behind a hay-bale.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          85.\n          Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with\n          his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast\n          onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another\n          of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-\n          flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors\n\n                         AND SCREAMS:\n\n                         ASH\n          Ki-ya!\n          Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes\n          light up.\n          Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the\n          dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his\n          nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw\n          hanging open.\n          The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears\n          out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and\n          thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run\n          around, panicking, with their guns blazing.\n          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their\n          motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds\n          it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an\n          instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the\n          motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He\n          says with the deepest affection and respect:\n\n                         FOX\n          Ash, that was pure, wild animal\n          craziness. You're an athlete.\n          Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.\n          (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash\n          will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and\n          animated slightly more gracefully.)\n          Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.\n          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port\n          with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The\n          snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:\n          Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the\n          edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:\n\n                         FOX\n          Holy swearing cuss!!!\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          86.\n          Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and\n          over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the\n          road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car\n          port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:\n\n                         BOGGIS\n          Franklin? You got any final twist for\n          this plot?\n\n                         BEAN\n\n                         (PAUSE)\n          Yeah!\n          Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts\n          throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis\n          kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the\n          rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a\n          hole in the ground. The old man with the grey moustache turns\n          to his son and says with a strong French accent:\n\n                         BADOIT\n          Cuss.\n\n          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY\n\n          Mrs. Fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder. Badger,\n          Weasel, Rickity, the two small rabbits, and the others sit,\n          exhausted, in the dark cavern, passing a jar of cider. Mole\n\n                         INTERRUPTS:\n\n                         MOLE\n          Stand by!\n          Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is holding the tin can with the\n          string attached to it to his ear. He nods and says urgently:\n\n                         MOLE\n          I just intercepted a high-frequency radio\n          signal with the can --\n          (gestures with the tin can)\n          -- and I think they're on their way home!\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          87.\n          Mrs. Fox jumps up, embraces Mole, and kisses him on the\n          snout. Mole blushes.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n          Rabbit still running full-steam back into the village being\n          pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole where\n          they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the\n          manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag's Head,\n          walk inside, and close the door behind them.\n\n          EXT. ROAD. DAY\n\n          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.\n          Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:\n\n                         KYLIE\n          Don't turn around!\n\n                         FOX\n          What?\n          Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes\n          stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the\n          brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.\n\n                         FOX\n          Where'd he come from?\n\n                         (LOUDLY)\n          Where'd you come from? What are you doing\n          here?\n          Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:\n\n                         FOX\n          Canis lupus!\n          Fox points to himself:\n\n                         FOX\n          Vulpes Vulpes!\n          The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson\n          watch idling from the motorcycle.\n\n                         FOX\n          I don't think he speaks English or Latin.\n\n                         (LOUDLY)\n          Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude?\n\n                         (ASIDE)\n          I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a\n          hard winter.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          88.\n          The wolf shakes his head. Fox nods.\n\n                         FOX\n          He doesn't seem to know.\n          Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his\n\n                         VOICE:\n\n                         FOX\n          I have a phobia of wolves!\n          The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth\n          open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs\n          out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the\n          identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox\n          closes his mouth and his eyes soften.\n          Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.\n          It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off\n          into the woods. Fox says wistfully:\n\n                         FOX\n          What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,\n          boys.\n          Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning\n          tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down\n          into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,\n          layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.\n\n                         TITLE:\n          THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)\n          The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family\n          having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit\n          and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable\n          television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver\n          and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a\n          tasteful sewer-conduit.\n          The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick\n          cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,\n          pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former\n          view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe\n          1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.\n          Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a\n          braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at\n          an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up\n          copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room\n          under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          89.\n          Fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says\n\n                         GENTLY:\n\n                         FOX\n          My darlings?\n          Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.\n\n          INT. DRAINPIPE. NIGHT\n\n          The cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and\n          his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen,\n          artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's\n          trousers.\n\n                         ASH\n          Where are we going?\n\n                         FOX\n          Nobody knows.\n\n                         ASH\n          We were in the middle of a meditation\n          practice.\n\n                         FOX\n          Watch your step.\n          Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a\n          metal ladder. He says theatrically:\n\n                         FOX\n          Let's see, now. Where does this lead?\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          Oh, no, Foxy.

I'm going to crack open this trap\n          door and see if something's on the other\n          side. I highly doubt it, though. There's\n          probably just more sewer.\n          Fox clears his throat. Pause.\n\n                         FOX\n          You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --\n\n                         ASH\n          Open it.\n          Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone\n          follows him.\n\n          INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT\n\n          Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the\n          center of a large grocery store. To their left is the\n          refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.\n          To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry\n          detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-\n          dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.\n          There are no people. Fox says casually:\n\n                         FOX\n          Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,\n          glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!\n          Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow\n          and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.\n\n          MRS.

Actually, I had to do quite a bit of\n          searching myself before I found a look\n          that really flattered me. Remember those\n          horseshoe cuff-links?\n          Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and\n          stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She\n          hesitates. She shrugs.\n\n          MRS. FOX\n          I'm pregnant again.\n          Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his\n          paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:\n\n                         ASH\n          Dad?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          92.\n          Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its\n          side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a\n          huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.\n\n                         ASH\n          Should we dance?\n          Pause.

Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.\n          Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean\n          cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's\n          Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender\n          pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to\n          Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.\n          The sun sets.
