WOODS. DAY\n</b>\n          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome\n          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans\n          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing\n          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.\n          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that\n          descends into the valley below.\n          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a\n          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears\n          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          What'd the doctor say?\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-\n          four hour bug. He gave me some pills.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>\n<b>                         (REASSURINGLY)\n</b>          I told you. You probably just ate some\n          bad gristle.\n          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They\n          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the\n          path. Fox points:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Should we take the short cut or the\n          scenic route?\n\n<b>          MRS.

It's actually slightly quicker,\n          anyway.\n          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a\n          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her\n          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off\n          down the scenic route.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          2.\n</b>\n<b>          EXT. FARM. DAY\n</b>\n          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and\n          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A\n          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from\n          the bushes outside a fence.\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          What is a squab?\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          You know what a squab is. It's like a\n          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of\n          bird we can eat.\n          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Should we go through the hole under the\n          horse fence or climb the rail over the\n          bridle path?\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a\n          little safer.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          But the bridle path puts us out right\n          next to the squab shack.\n          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods\n          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          What's wrong? I've never seen you like\n          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't\n          worry. I've been stealing birds for a\n          living since before I could trot.\n\n<b>          MRS.

You gave me\n          the scenic route already.\n          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          By the way, you look unbelievably\n          beautiful tonight. You're practically\n          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          3.\n</b>          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She\n          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her\n          cheek.\n          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this\n          shot which can be literally lit from within.)\n          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and\n          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race\n          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window\n          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing\n          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond\n          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever\n          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and\n          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,\n          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely\n          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden\n          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a\n          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.\n          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his\n          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs\n          impatiently. They duck inside.\n          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in\n          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above\n          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his\n          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!\n          Look at this.\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          Get away from there.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...\n          (pointing to different spots)\n          I guess if you come from over there, and\n          you're standing at the door to the squab\n          shack, this little gadget probably\n          triggers the --\n          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)\n          Move out of the way, darling. That's\n          right where it's going to land.\n          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          4.\n</b>          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly\n          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of\n          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox\n          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          No, it just falls straight down right\n          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-\n          loaded.\n          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,\n          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says\n\n<b>                         QUIETLY:\n</b>\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          I'm pregnant.\n          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,\n          that's great news!\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I\n          want you to find another line of work.\n          Pause. Fox nods.\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,\n          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a\n          river running through the middle.\n\n<b>                         TITLE:\n</b>          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)\n\n<b>          EXT.

DAY\n</b>\n          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two\n          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a\n          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the\n          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-\n          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at\n          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          5.\n</b>          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,\n          Victorian-style dress.\n\n<b>                         INSERT:\n</b>          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of\n          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Does anybody actually read my column?

Let's get cracking!\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Why would they?

A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the\n          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is\n          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          I'm sick.\n\n<b>          MRS.

FOX\n</b>          You don't have a temperature.\n          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          I don't want to go.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          6.\n</b>\n<b>          MRS.

Fox whispers to her:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          I love the way you handled that.\n          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first\n          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be\n          extra nice to him, because he's going\n          through a very hard time right now, OK?\n          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white\n          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into\n          them. He says aggressively:\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          Where's he going to sleep?\n\n<b>          MRS.

Put him in Dad's\n          study.\n          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.\n          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He\n          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.\n          It makes me feel poor.\n          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says\n\n<b>                         SOFTLY:\n</b>\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          We are poor -- but we're happy.\n          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          7.\n</b>\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are\n          better above ground.\n          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of\n          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My\n          father died at seven and a half. I don't\n          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm\n          going to do something about it.\n          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of\n          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands\n          and picks up his cup of coffee.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Well, I'm off.\n          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on\n          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his\n          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts\n\n<b>                         CHEERILY:\n</b>\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Have a good day, my darlings!\n          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white\n          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his\n          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves\n          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks\n          puzzled.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          What's he wearing?\n          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves\n          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded\n          up section of his newspaper.\n\n<b>                         INSERT:\n</b>          A clipping from the real estate section.

Fox\n          leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,\n          whistling and hollering:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Look at that! This kid's a natural!

EVENING\n</b>\n          Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a\n          braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book\n          called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a\n          picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in\n          the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with\n          a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing\n          tae-kwon-do.

He looks at Kristofferson in the\n          next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the\n          floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs\n          touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to\n          Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          How long is Kristofferson supposed to\n          stay with us?\n\n<b>          MRS.

Double-pneumonia isn't\n          even really that big of a deal, is it?\n          In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts\n          practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the\n          doorway and whispers forcefully:\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to\n          be alive.

Badger\n          stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's\n          overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field\n          mouse with a bandana tied in a \"do-rag\" style around his\n          head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at\n          each other, screaming simultaneously:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          You scared the cuss out of us!\n\n<b>                         BADGER\n</b>          I told you not to buy at nine and a\n          cussing half!\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          46.\n</b>\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          You don't just bang into somebody's\n          cussing tunnel!\n\n<b>                         BADGER\n</b>          Are you cussing yelling at me!\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          You're cussing right I'm cussing yelling!\n\n<b>                         BADGER\n</b>          We're all cussing starving to death\n          because of you, you mangy, cussing,\n          little cuss!\n          Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling\n          around the hole.

His\n          paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and\n          shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of\n          the tunnel.

She nods. She hands Ash the\n          lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the\n          mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.\n          Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a\n          very special direction.\n          Fox feels the walls with his paws.

Fox suddenly whistles\n          and raises his fist.\n          The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his\n          paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at\n          the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.\n          Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They\n          all duck down and wait.

Everyone is seated at the long\n          dining room table, and a magnificent feast with every variety\n          of fruit, meat, vegetable, and roasted bird has been laid out\n          in front of them. They tear into their meals, eating and\n          drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly\n          into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.\n          Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider\n          glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy\n          of eating. Badger clears his throat.\n\n<b>                         BADGER\n</b>          Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all\n          of you to finally take me up on my offer\n          to have you over to the flint-mine for\n          dinner, but I guess we have --\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>\n<b>                         (INTERRUPTING)\n</b>          I'm sorry.

The shot continues past Boggis,\n          Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis\n          growls. Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump\n          on the side of the fire truck. The chief points:\n\n<b>                         CHIEF\n</b>          Let her rip.\n          A fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut. A pressure\n          gauge shoots to maximum.

Am I still paranoid?\n          There is a low, distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a\n          deafening roar. Everyone waits, frozen. A single drop of\n          water drips from the ceiling into Badger's water glass. Fox\n          turns to Badger and says:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Let's pause again.\n          A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine\n          and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and\n          everything away chaotically.\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>          The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates,\n          furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel with the\n          rushing waters.

Fox picks himself\n          up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends\n          and their families.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          What the cuss just happened?

In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up\n          off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away\n          twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.\n          Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down\n          the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his\n          teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is\n          suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.\n          Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned\n          boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing\n          Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his\n          switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.\n          Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers\n          of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows\n          Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,\n          baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          63.\n</b>\n<b>                         RAT\n</b>          I've still got it.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>\n<b>                         (FROWNING)\n</b>          What'd you just say?\n\n<b>                         RAT\n</b>          I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.\n          She never asked for it back.\n          A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto\n          Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the\n          ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and\n          struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox\n          releases him.\n          Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next\n          to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:\n\n<b>                         RAT\n</b>          The boy's locked in an apple crate on top\n          of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean\n          Annex.

He licks his lips and says faintly:\n\n<b>                         RAT\n</b>          Like melted gold.\n          Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead.

They\n          both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the\n          distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox\n          over the sound of the motor:\n\n<b>                         KYLIE\n</b>          Are you scared of wolves?\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          75.\n</b>\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Scared, no!

I feel like I'm\n          losing my mind!\n          Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it\n          slightly and fly over a little ditch.

A white-washed brick pile six stories\n          tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its\n          courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean\n          Annex.\n          The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters\n          vegetables next to the driveway.

They come\n          out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the\n          gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys.

He picks the lock\n          and opens the doors.\n          The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,\n          there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a\n          compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,\n          broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,\n          fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.\n          White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.\n          Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck\n          reads Spitz.\n          Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens\n          his eyes.

Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.\n          The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an\n          enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,\n          and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the\n          courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and\n          snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his\n          voice cracking like a grandmother's:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Climb the trellis!\n          In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis\n          six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping\n          off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof\n          of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a\n          pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look\n          down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane\n          fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the\n          courtyard.\n          Fox takes in their new surroundings.

The lock clicks. Ash's eyes\n          light up.\n          Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the\n          dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his\n          nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw\n          hanging open.\n          The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears\n          out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and\n          thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run\n          around, panicking, with their guns blazing.\n          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their\n          motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds\n          it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an\n          instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the\n          motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He\n          says with the deepest affection and respect:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Ash, that was pure, wild animal\n          craziness.

The\n          snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:\n          Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the\n          edge of the property.

Bunce starts\n          throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis\n          kicks Bunce in the stomach.

I'm going to crack open this trap\n          door and see if something's on the other\n          side. I highly doubt it, though. There's\n          probably just more sewer.\n          Fox clears his throat. Pause.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          Open it.\n          Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone\n          follows him.\n\n<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT\n</b>\n          Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the\n          center of a large grocery store. To their left is the\n          refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.\n          To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry\n          detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-\n          dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.\n          There are no people. Fox says casually:\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,\n          glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!\n          Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow\n          and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          You really are kind of a quote-unquote\n          fantastic fox.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>\n<b>                         (SHRUGS)\n</b>          I try.

Well, now's the time to buy.\n          Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature\n          shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives,\n          pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids,\n          toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says\n\n<b>                         BRIGHTLY:\n</b>\n<b>                         KYLIE\n</b>          Did I hear my name?\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>\n<b>                         (SMILING)\n</b>          Not down here, you didn't.\n\n<b>                         KYLIE\n</b>\n<b>                         (SMILING BLANKLY)\n</b>          Why not?\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          Because we were talking about other\n          things.\n\n<b>                         KYLIE\n</b>\n<b>                         (RESIGNED)\n</b>          Oh, well.\n          Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of tropical\n          juice punch-boxes.\n\n<b>                         FOX\n</b>          The white cape rather suits him, doesn't\n          it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of\n          searching myself before I found a look\n          that really flattered me. Remember those\n          horseshoe cuff-links?\n          Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and\n          stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She\n          hesitates. She shrugs.\n\n<b>          MRS. FOX\n</b>          I'm pregnant again.\n          Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his\n          paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          Dad?\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          92.\n</b>          Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its\n          side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a\n          huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.\n\n<b>                         ASH\n</b>          Should we dance?\n          Pause. Everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig.\n          Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox spins Mrs. Fox.\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>          A wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the supermarket stacked\n          with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars of every\n          possible variety of food. The family of foxes continues to\n          dance at the distant end of the center aisle.\n\n<b>          EXT. STREET. DAY\n</b>\n          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs\n          around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.\n          Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean\n          cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's\n          Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender\n          pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to\n          Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.\n          The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Fantastic-Mr-Fox.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Fantastic Mr Fox</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Roald Dahl\" title=\"Scripts by Roald Dahl\">Roald Dahl</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Wes Anderson\" title=\"Scripts by Wes Anderson\">Wes Anderson</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Noah Baumbach\" title=\"Scripts by Noah Baumbach\">Noah Baumbach</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Animation\" title=\"Animation Scripts\">Animation</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Family\" title=\"Family Scripts\">Family</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Fantastic Mr Fox Script.html#comments\" title=\"Fantastic Mr Fox comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:08.547385"}
