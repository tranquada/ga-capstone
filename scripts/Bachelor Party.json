ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY\n</b>\n               CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, \n               obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy \n               Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray \n               blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. \n               They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the \n               statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth \n               grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The \n               other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a \n               stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both \n               firmly by the shoulders.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                         Make one more move and you'll both \n                         be staying late for the rest of the \n                         week.\n\n<b>                                     THE BOYS\n</b>                              (softly; in unison)\n                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                         I didn't hear you.\n\n<b>                                     THE BOYS\n</b>                              (louder)\n                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.\n\n               Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks \n               out past the parking lot gate.\n\n               Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full \n               throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the \n               loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking \n               place around the corner.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                              (used to this)\n                         Step away from the curb, children.\n\n<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n               Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school \n               bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. \n               The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet \n               of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting \n               halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings \n               open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life \n               of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.\n\n               While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the \n               only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a \n               driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his \n               capabilities and get serious in his next life... This \n               incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps \n               up to him.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                         You're late again, Rick.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                         I know, Sister, but I have a very \n                         good excuse.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                         There can be no excuse for tardiness.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                         You're absolutely right. I should \n                         never have stopped to save that \n                         drowning infant. I'm just weak, \n                         Sister; I'm so weak.\n\n               He starts sobbing softly into his hands.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                         All right, stop that... Children, on \n                         the bus.\n\n               The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is \n               drying his tears with his handkerchief.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                         Sister, do you ever get lonely after \n                         vespers? If you do, why don't you \n                         give me a call. I'm in the book.\n\n<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS\n</b>                              (smiling despite \n                              herself)\n                         Get going, Rick... you're late enough \n                         as it is.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                         Right... Think it over.\n\n               He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus \n               out of the parking lot.\n\n<b>               INT. BUS - DAY\n</b>\n               As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell \n               breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting \n               like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with \n               books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top \n               of their lungs.\n\n<b>               ANGLE - RICK\n</b>\n               He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, \n               revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches \n               the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the \n               P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                              (over mike)\n                         If you don't all calm down I'm gonna \n                         drive this thing over a cliff.\n\n               The kids pay no attention to him.\n\n<b>                                     RICK\n</b>                              (continuing; \n                              philosophically)\n                         Ah... youth.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE BUS\n</b>\n               Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled \n               with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. \n               The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his \n               engine. Rick counters by gunning his.\n\n<b>               INT. THE BUS\n</b>\n               All the kids start screaming \"Race... race.\" \"Wipe 'em out.\" \n               \"Go for it.\" Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out \n               money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.\n\n<b>               ANGLE - RICK\n</b>\n               as he readies for action.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE BUSES\n</b>\n               The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky \n               school buses filled with kids can be.\n\n<b>               WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET\n</b>\n               The two buses come zooming down the street.\n\n<b>               INT. RICK'S BUS\n</b>\n               The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little \n               boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE\n</b>\n               The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with \n               one another.\n\n<b>               INT. THE BUS\n</b>\n               The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who \n               is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination \n               of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale \n               shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to \n               control the inevitable.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE BUSES\n</b>\n               They race down a steep hill.\n\n<b>               INT. THE BUS\n</b>\n               The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE OTHER BUS\n</b>\n               Something hits with a splat against the windshield that \n               resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.\n\n<b>               INT. THE OTHER BUS\n</b>\n               The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it \n               worse.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE STREET\n</b>\n               Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering \n               of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick \n               puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.\n\n<b>               INT. RICK'S BUS\n</b>\n               Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the \n               front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage \n               a victorious cheer.\n\n<b>               PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV\n</b>\n               We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one-\n               year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR \n               the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.\n\n<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)\n</b>                         Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... \n                         and watch the birdie.\n\n               He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.\n\n<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)\n</b>                         There.\n\n<b>               O'NEILL\n</b>\n               We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera \n               department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest \n               of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest \n               and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But \n               under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's \n               best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the \n               camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering \n               up her baby.\n\n<b>                                     O'NEILL\n</b>                         These should be in the mail to you \n                         by next Friday.\n\n               She smiles and exits.\n\n<b>                                     O'NEILL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         Next.\n\n               A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. \n               Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in \n               her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes \n               settle onto her full breasts.

The \n               cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current \n               trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's \n               in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as \n               she sways lost in the ozone to the music.

This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She \n               seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's \n               actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This \n               impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and \n               has a clear sense of herself.

We PULL BACK, REVEALING \n               other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in \n               sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they \n               are much too busy dancing.\n\n               The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy-\n               looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside.

All their carrying-on stops \n               when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a \n               hotel manager, he'd be a mortician.

He then places Debbie inside the truck \n               and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones \n               in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing \n               the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting \n               speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. \n               He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.\n\n<b>               INT.

MOVIE THEATER\n</b>\n               The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action \n               on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman \n               arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to \n               the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. \n               He gives chase and catches up with Cole.\n\n               He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them \n               on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.\n\n               A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly \n               watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is \n               in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole \n               with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie \n               patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the \n               film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks.

The wind \n                         begins to pick up.

Hey...\n\n               People begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, \n               we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms.
