It's 6:45\r\n           Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The\r\n           weather is great! I figure by now\r\n           that Leona, my housemate - Hi\r\n           Leona! - has missed me hopefully\r\n           since I didn't show up last night.\r\n           Another hour and a half they'll\r\n           miss me for not showing up for\r\n           work. Hi Brion at work! Best case\r\n           scenario is they notify the police\r\n           and after a 24 hour hold they file\r\n           a report, a missing persons report.\r\n           Which means noon tomorrow it's\r\n           official that I'm gone. I do still\r\n           have the tiniest bit of water left.\r\n           Well, actually, I've resorted...I've\r\n           had a couple pretty good gulps of\r\n           urine that I saved in my Camelbak.\r\n           I sorta let it distill...it tastes\r\n           like hell. So it's 70 hours since\r\n           I left on my bike from Horseshoe\r\n           Trailhead during which time I have\r\n           consumed 3 liters of water and a\r\n           couple mouthfuls of piss.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Pause.\r\n           Did I say the weather is great?\r\n           Well, it is. Though flash floods\r\n           potential is still present. There's\r\n           4-prong major canyons upstream from\r\n           me that all converge in this 3 foot\r\n           wide gap where I am.

Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling\r\n          scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots\r\n          of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally\r\n          his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and\r\n          grunts thru the pain.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As\r\n          we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of\r\n          blood on the lower walls.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he\r\n          ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another\r\n          target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented\r\n          sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and\r\n          growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope\r\n          whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT/EXT.

The\r\n          scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the\r\n          dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his\r\n          dry eyes.\r\n          He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep\r\n          green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and\r\n          he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and\r\n          he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of\r\n          vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow\r\n          turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now\r\n          he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and\r\n          zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself\r\n          lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to\r\n          the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign\r\n          land.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing\r\n\r\n<b>           70.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open\r\n          between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't\r\n          have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and\r\n          licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and\r\n          listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is\r\n          uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up\r\n          speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He\r\n          lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time.
