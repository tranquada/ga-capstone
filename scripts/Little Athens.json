JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING\n</b><b>          \n</b>          The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about\n          eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-\n          shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.\n<b>          \n</b>          Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and\n          tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING\n          from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT.

Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and\n          jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can\n          of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT.

He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and\n          exits the bathroom.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT.

Jerry tosses his\n          Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE\n          and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.\n          He has pitifully few belongings.

Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but\n          still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his\n          Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to\n          look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.\n<b>          \n</b>          He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with\n          handle until the screen door opens.

Heather is\n          holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen\n          door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,\n          with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an\n          appetite for greasy food and cheap beer.
