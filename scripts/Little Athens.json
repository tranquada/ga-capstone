JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING\n          \n          The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about\n          eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-\n          shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.\n          \n          Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and\n          tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING\n          from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.\n          \n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and\n          not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and\n          jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can\n          of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.\n          \n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the\n          sink.\n          \n          He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he\n          is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and\n          exits the bathroom.\n          \n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a\n          naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old\n          POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot\n          of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his\n          Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE\n          and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.\n          He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.\n          \n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a\n          house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but\n          still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his\n          Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to\n          look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.\n          \n          He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with\n          handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen\n          door slam shut behind him.\n          \n          TITLE CARD:\n          \n          Little Athens\n          \n                                                                                 2\n          EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING\n          \n          The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded\n          sign reading \"ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD\" stands in front.\n          \n                                 HEATHER (O.S.)\n                    You hear about your ex?\n          \n                                 ALLISON (O.S.)\n                    Jerry?\n          \n          INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about\n          nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with \"EMS\" stitched\n          conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden\n          table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9\" and built like a lingerie\n          model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than\n          Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than\n          Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of\n          her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.\n          Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she\n          has a lot on her mind.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to\n                    Middletown. He left this morning.\n          \n                                  ALLISON\n                    No way.   How do you know?\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Carter said. He got some job at some\n                    company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.\n          \n          Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and\n          stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the\n          window.\n          \n                                 ALLISON\n                    Doesn't sound so bad.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.\n          \n                                 ALLISON\n                    I don't want to go to a baseball game.\n                    You're going with Derek anyway.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek\n                    told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by\n                    myself.\n          \n                                                                                 3\n                                 ALLISON\n                    I thought Adam was hurt.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    I wish.\n          \n          Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.\n          \n          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING\n          \n          BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is\n          standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt\n          and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their\n          late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept\n          last night.\n          \n          Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over\n          to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through\n          the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of\n          the mailbox that hangs next to the door.\n          \n                                 BRAD\n                         (banging on the window\n                         pane)\n                    Hey! Jimmy!\n          \n          The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4\"\n          and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.\n          Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.\n          \n                                 BRAD (CONT'D)\n                    Finally!\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    Office hours are nine to five.\n          \n                                 MEGAN\n                    You have a lot of credit card bills in\n                    there, Jimmy.\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                         (holding his hand out for\n                         the Mail)\n                    I know.\n          \n          Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.\n          \n                                 MEGAN\n                    You're not mad that we're stopping by like\n                    this?\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I\n                    gotta go to work.\n          \n                                                                                4\n                                 MEGAN\n                         (explaining to Amy)\n                    Jimmy's got like, six jobs.\n          \n          Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.\n          Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to\n          Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.\n          \n                                 BRAD\n                    Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec.

And you heard all the stories I\n                    heard, about that horse-cock, and how he\n                    can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it\n                    too, like when he whipped it out at\n                    Tomlinson's party...\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    Alright Brad!

POOL -- MORNING\n          \n          The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening\n          blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about\n          twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is\n          standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as\n          if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with\n          tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard\n          concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many\n          pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,\n          down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to\n          him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.\n          Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.\n          \n                                 COREY\n                    Nice.\n          \n                                 PEDRO\n                    Fuck you, conjo.

A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.\n          Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone.

Harry rushes toward the\n          Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks\n          it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry.

Heather's moderate driving speed is in\n          sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.\n          At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather\n          \n                                                                                 17\n          stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though\n          there are no cars at the intersection.\n          \n                                 HARRY\n                    Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    We'll get there.\n          \n                                 ALLISON\n                    You don't even know for sure if she slept\n                    with Steve!\n          \n          Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the\n          road.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Listen, fuck that slut, okay?!

COREY AND PEDRO'S HOUSE -- MORNING\n          \n          The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs\n          out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a\n          gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying\n          her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front\n          yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring\n          houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.\n          Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a\n          brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He\n          tries unsuccessfully to open the door.\n          \n          He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen\n          and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at\n          Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's\n          locked.\n          \n          Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her\n          Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the\n          wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and\n          \n                                                                                 18\n          looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,\n          frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the\n          neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure\n          the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her\n          head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole\n          situation.\n          \n          EXT.

The Cordless Phone continues to ring.\n          \n          Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car.\n          Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He\n          steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands\n          back, unsure of what to do.\n          \n          Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a\n          GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a\n          large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his\n          Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet.\n          \n          Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors.\n          \n          EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just\n          outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind.\n          \n          INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into\n          the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters.\n          \n          He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch.\n          He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that\n          Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents\n          of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a\n          few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER.\n          \n          He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in\n          front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car.\n          \n                                                                                29\n          EXT.

JIMMY'S CAR -- LATER\n          \n          Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from\n          the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in\n          the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped\n          around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging\n          down over the steering wheel so that he can read it. Jimmy's CELL\n          PHONE rings.\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                         (over the wind and music)\n                    Yeah, it's Jimmy!\n          \n                                 MATT (O.S.)\n                         (barely audible)\n                    Hey Jimmy, it's Matt.

He's wearing an\n          old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge\n          of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes\n          piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his\n          free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.\n          \n                                 MATT\n                         (semi-whispering)\n                    I need some K, dude.

Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the\n          window back up.\n          \n                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)\n                    Yeah, it's Jimmy!\n          \n          We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing\n          back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although\n          the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,\n          as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.\n          \n                                 MATT\n                    Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me!

JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger\n          seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have\n          instinctively reached to hold back a child.

He slams the door\n          shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.\n          A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the\n          passenger seat.

Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping\n          her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one\n          hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.\n          \n                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)\n                    Fuck you!\n          \n                                 AARON\n                    Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!\n          \n          Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos\n          pulls into the street.

Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so\n          that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang.\n          \n          Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking\n          around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and\n          sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas\n          gage. It's more than 3/4 full.\n          \n          Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and\n          hitches the Mustang to the back of it.

CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- EVENING\n          \n          Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old\n          dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard\n          surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just\n          about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his\n          early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a\n          beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average\n          build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are\n          unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.\n          HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is\n          holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen\n          door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,\n          with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an\n          appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.\n          \n                                  CARTER\n                    What's up.\n          \n          Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck.\n          \n                                  ALLISON\n                    Hey Carter.\n          \n          Carter slams the handle from the inside - the door opens.\n          \n                                  CARTER\n                    What's up.\n          \n                                                                                 75\n                                 HEATHER\n                         (busting Carter's chops\n                         with a mocking tone)\n                    What's up.\n          \n          As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his\n          hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds\n          the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it\n          open.\n          \n          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house\n          that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate.\n          Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around.\n          Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch.

Through\n          the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro\n          glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,\n          before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto\n          the road.

CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed\n          stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a\n          small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that\n          have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at\n          SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an\n          average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.\n          Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty\n          old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his\n          stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a\n          few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that\n          might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap\n          rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy\n          fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ\n          closing the door behind them.\n          \n                                 LOUIE\n                    Sinjin!\n          \n          Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at\n          the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the\n          ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his\n          exhaustive venture.\n          \n                                 SINJIN\n                    Mr. Pizzaman!

CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT\n          \n          AARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and\n          CARLOS.

It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there\n          frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid.\n          \n          Aaron and Troy approach.    It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be\n          there.\n          \n                                 AARON\n                         (to Carlos)\n                    Hey guy.\n          \n                                   CARLOS\n                    Hey.\n          \n                                 AARON\n                    You like talking to my girl?\n          \n                                 CARLOS\n                    Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.\n          \n                                    AARON\n                    No?

Jessica, unfazed, takes another\n          hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and\n          because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in\n          calm \"I'm above this\" mannerisms.\n          \n                                 AARON (CONT'D)\n                         (to Carlos)\n                    Go 'head, take her home.

You never\n                    know.\n          \n          Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle\n          before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica\n          grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it\n          off.\n          \n                                 AARON (CONT'D)\n                    You're good at that.

I mean, you get so angry,\n                    it's a little scary.\n          \n          Allison sits up on the couch. Heather sits up directly facing\n          Allison, her hands on Allison's lap.\n          \n                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)\n                    I get scared when you get all angry.

Both are bawling as they\n          embrace.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    I don't mean it! You're my best friend!\n                    My sister!

The noise of the party drowns out\n          their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's\n          ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form\n          the word \"what?\" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face\n          becomes furious. She pushes Allison back.\n          \n                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)\n                    You fucking slut!\n          \n          Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles\n          roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather\n          around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is\n          on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of\n          Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches\n          Allison square in the face, knocking her limp.\n          \n                                                                                 107\n          Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick\n          at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away.\n          Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is\n          tending to Allison.\n          \n          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENT'S LATER\n          \n          HEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a\n          beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until\n          she is directly in front of him.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                         (pointing to Berubi's\n                         bedroom)\n                    Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains\n                    out?\n          \n                                 RJ\n                    Sure, I don't give a shit.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Fucking great, let's go.\n          \n          Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing\n          JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he\n          passes.\n          \n          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in\n          tow.

Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE.\n          \n                                 BOBBY\n                    I can't figure you Jimmy.\n          \n                                 SINJIN\n                         (O.S.)\n                    Where the fuck is RJ?\n          \n          The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires\n          into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind.\n          \n                                 LOUIE\n                    Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!\n          \n                                                                                108\n          Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels\n          Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK\n          DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap.\n          \n                                 SINJIN\n                    This your partner?\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    Where you been?\n          \n                                 SINJIN\n                    Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took\n                    long enough.\n          \n          Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on\n          the center of the room.

Louie may be a\n                    fool...\n          \n          Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair.\n          Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball\n          Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the\n          Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and\n          into the floor.\n          \n          As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we\n          saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the\n          room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby.\n          \n          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT\n          \n          JESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.   CARLOS is right\n          behind.\n          \n                                 JESSICA\n                    Where'd we park?\n          \n                                  CARLOS\n                    Over here.\n          \n          Carlos begins walking over to his CAR, and Jessica walks alongside.\n          Jessica is clearly drunk. Passing by a now high EMILY backed up\n          against a tree staring off into nowhere as MALE PARTYGOER 1 kisses\n          her neck, they arrive at Carlos' Car. Carlos walks over to the\n          driver-side door, but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk.\n          \n                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)\n                    What are you doing?

I'm\n                    gonna knock his teeth out.\n          \n                                 CARLOS\n                    Let's just go home.\n          \n                                 JESSICA\n                    Carlos, open the trunk!\n          \n                                                                                110\n          \n          Carlos grudgingly obeys. He walks back to the trunk and inserts his\n          KEY, then lifts up. Jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball\n          BAT. She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house.\n          \n          AARON walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch,\n          TROY right behind. Aaron is holding a bag of FROZEN VEGETABLES to\n          his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle.\n          He spots Carlos and Jessica, and walks deliberately toward them.\n          \n                                 CARLOS\n                    Get in the car.\n          \n                                 JESSICA\n                    I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.\n          \n          Carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the point.

Clear outta here.\n          \n          Police Officer 1 enters the house, passing CARLOS among the crowd\n          making it's way out of the house. He walks across the back yard\n          with his KEYS in his hand. He glances down at his shoes a moment as\n          he spots JESSICA, AARON and TROY approaching.

POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Heather's body is contorted to her side to relieve the discomfort\n          caused by the HANDCUFFS. Through the window facing Carter's house\n          we see a figure approaching. As the figure nears, we recognize\n          DEREK, seemingly recovered from his earlier thrashing. Heather does\n          not notice Derek as he nears the door. Derek opens the door.\n          Heather looks up at him.\n          \n                                 HEATHER\n                    Get away from me.\n          \n          Derek pulls Heather from the police car, and the exhausted Heather\n          gives only nominal resistance.

Allison\n          has her arms crossed across her body as if she were hugging herself\n          for warmth, both her and Heather's purses strapped over her\n          shoulder, her KEYS dangling from her hand. Heather begins walking\n          slowly towards Allison, passing by...\n          \n          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          COREY and PEDRO are seated in the back of the POLICE CAR. Corey\n          looks over at Pedro- the look of foolish optimism usually present on\n          Pedro's face has vanished. He looks down at the floor of the Police\n          Car.\n          \n          Through the side window of the Police Car we see JESSICA, AARON, and\n          TROY and climbing into Troy's CAR. Troy is handing Aaron his KEYS\n          before climbing into the back seat.\n          \n          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Aaron is behind the wheel sticking the Keys into the ignition.\n          Jessica is in the passenger seat looking through her PURSE for her\n          CIGARETTES. Troy sits in the back seat, spent.\n          \n                                 JESSICA\n                    I left my novel in Carlos' car.\n          \n                                                                                125\n                                 AARON\n                    You wanna get it?\n          \n                                 JESSICA\n                    I'll get it tomorrow.

Without\n          warning, as Jessica takes a drag, Aaron punches Jessica square in\n          the jaw. The lit Cigarette flies out of Jessica's mouth, and\n          Jessica falls out of view. Aaron reaches down, grabs the Cigarette\n          and puts it in his mouth, still angry.\n          \n          He slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street,\n          passing Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the opposite direction.\n          The engine is still off. JIMMY is sitting still behind the wheel,\n          hands down in his lap, staring straight ahead. PULL IN and HOLD on\n          Jimmy.\n          \n          EXT.
