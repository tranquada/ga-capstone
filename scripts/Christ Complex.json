Zoey doesn't bother to\r\nstay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.\r\n\r\nQuinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.\r\nDetails of this climatic battle will be choreographed by\r\nthe actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers\r\nfilm.\r\n\r\nWe don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at\r\nit until we can't tell who is who.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE\r\n</b>\r\nZoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.\r\n\r\n<b>CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE\r\n</b>\r\nShe starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position\r\nto hit send.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD\r\n</b>\r\nZoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks\r\nback toward where the battle is going on.\r\n\r\nShe starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.\r\nFinally the jog turns into a full run.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OPEN FIELD\r\n</b>\r\nWhen she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All\r\nthat can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an\r\nempty ninja suit.\r\nZoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ZOEY\r\n</b>             (laughs to herself)\r\n             I am Curious:Yellow\r\n             (beat)\r\n             Goodbye boys...\r\n\r\nZoey stares out into the open field.
