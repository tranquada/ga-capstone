Morning light fills the room.      The\n              sound of wind, and rippling cloth.\n          \n              Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly.\n          \n              Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed?\n          \n              No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her.\n              Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.\n          \n                                     MARIA\n                        Hey.     Are you okay?\n          \n              Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward\n              towards an OPEN WINDOW.\n          \n              There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly,\n              almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles.\n          \n              Maria gets out of bed, concerned.\n          \n                                    MARIA\n                        Peter?

His face is a blank.\n          \n              Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window.\n          \n              Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from\n              outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below.\n          \n              Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards\n              the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --\n          \n              -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head\n              has burst open, his body broken and twisted.\n          \n              ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the\n              center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see --\n          \n              -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS.\n              A translation appears over them: \"The Grudge.\"\n          \n          \n          2   EXT.

Silence.\n          \n               Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall.\n          \n          \n          17   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DUSK                            17\n          \n               Karen steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the\n               wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room.\n          \n               She listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except --\n          \n               Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty\n               shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange.\n          \n               And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again.\n          \n          18                                                                18\n               INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK\n               Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again,\n               and this time there's no doubt --\n          \n               The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.\n          \n               Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie\n               sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob.\n          \n               THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING\n               continues, coming from beyond the door.\n          \n                                   KAREN\n                             (nervous:)\n                         Hello?\n          \n               Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob.\n          \n          19                                                                19\n               INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK\n               The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER\n               BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A\n               frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.\n          \n               She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence.\n          \n               Then --\n          \n                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     12.\n          \n          \n          \n               SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE\n               CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from.\n          \n               And then she notices something strange about the closet door:\n          \n               It's been sealed shut with duct tape.\n          \n               The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.\n          \n               And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there?\n          \n               Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door\n               handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --\n          \n               The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf.\n               Karen reaches inside and picks it up.\n          \n               Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a\n               SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her.\n          \n               Karen slides the door the rest of the way open --\n          \n               -- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the\n               corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.\n          \n               Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards.\n          \n          20                                                                20\n               INT.

Just please get\n                         here as soon as you can.\n          \n               Karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.\n               She leans against the counter, exasperated.\n          \n               Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet.\n          \n               Karen can't resist.   She opens it.\n          \n               THE BOOK is a large journal, filled with elegant Japanese\n               writing. Karen flips through it, stopping on --\n          \n                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        13.\n          \n          \n          \n               A PHOTOGRAPH.

Then she looks up,\n               startled by --\n          \n               THE BOY. He's kneeling on the second floor landing above,\n               watching her through the bars of the metal railing. Creepy.\n          \n               Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.\n          \n                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)\n                         Hello there.\n          \n                                              Really creepy.\n               The boy just stares at her.\n                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)\n                         My name is Karen.

THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n               Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the\n               voices of a happy couple on the GREETING (in English):\n          \n                                   MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)\n                         \"Konnichiwa!

Right by the front doors, where the ladder\n          stood earlier.

A scanned picture of the\n                newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with\n                familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.\n          \n                But then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom\n                of the page --\n          \n                -- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she\n                found in the journal.

From nearby.\n          \n                 Nakagawa freezes.    The splashing continues.    His eyes go to --\n          \n                 THE BATHROOM DOOR. It's closed. The SPLASHING is coming\n                 from inside, accompanied by a series of THUDS.

Karen sits\n                 down and gently removes the lid of one of them.\n          \n                 THE BOX contains stacks of PHOTOGRAPHS and notes. Karen\n                 removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it.\n          \n                 After a moment, Maria sits down next to her. She opens the\n                 other box and pulls out another stack of photos.\n          \n                 She looks at the first one, sadness crossing her face.\n          \n                                     MARIA\n                           This was our first date.\n          \n                 She shows Karen THE TOP PHOTO: a \"self-portrait\" of Peter\n                 and Maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees.\n          \n                 The pain returns, and she puts the picture away.\n          \n                 Karen works through her own pile: she's looking at pictures\n                 of Peter from his University days.\n          \n                 Her eyes widen as she sees --\n          \n                 Kayako. She looks young and alive... but yet somehow sullen\n                 and withdrawn, as if she feels she doesn't belong there.\n          \n                 She's with a group of fellow students. PETER is in the\n                 group, although he and Kayako aren't next to one another.\n          \n                 Karen turns to the next picture -- it's a graduation party.\n          \n                 Kayako is in this one too: standing to the side, watching\n                 PETER AND MARIA as they give a goofy grin to the camera.\n          \n                                  Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      77A.\n          \n          \n          \n          As Karen flips through them, a definite pattern emerges --\n          \n          -- Kayako is in practically every picture.\n          \n          And in most, she's not smiling at the camera.    Rather, she's\n          staring at Peter.\n          \n                               KAREN\n                        (under her breath:)\n                    Oh my God.\n          \n                               MARIA\n                    What?

COLLEGE - PETER'S OFFICE - DAY (THREE YEARS AGO)       119\n          \n                The same GROUP PHOTO is in a frame on Peter's desk.\n          \n                Peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot\n                his tie. His open door reads: `DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH'.\n          \n                A CO-WORKER (20s, Japanese) enters with a stack of mail.\n          \n                                    PETER\n                          Happy Monday.\n          \n                                    CO-WORKER\n                          Yeah, right. Here's your mail.\n          \n                He hands it to Peter. On the top is a small BLUE ENVELOPE.\n                The name in the return address is `Kayako'.\n          \n                                          Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       79.\n          \n          \n          \n                                     CO-WORKER\n                           Another one, huh?\n          \n                 Peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.\n          \n                                     PETER\n                           I don't even know her. She says I\n                           used to tutor her, but I don't know\n                           who the hell she is.\n          \n                 The co-worker shrugs and leaves.    Disturbed, Peter fingers\n                 the blue envelope.\n          \n                 His eyes go to one of his desk drawers.    He slides it open.\n          \n                 More BLUE ENVELOPES are inside.    All from `KAYAKO'.\n          \n                 Peter's face darkens.   He dumps the letters into a trash can.\n          \n          120                                                                120\n                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY\n                 Peter stands in front of The House.\n          \n                 He glances down at the BLUE ENVELOPE in his hand. He stuffs\n                 it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do.\n          \n                 Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front\n                 door. Knocks. Silence from inside. He rings the bell.\n                 Waits. No one comes. He's about to leave --\n          \n                 But then he hears something from around the side of the\n                 house. It sounded like a muffled SPLASH of water.\n          \n          \n          120a   EXT. THE HOUSE - SIDE - DAY                                120a\n          \n                 Peter peers around the side of the house, a narrow walkway\n                 lined with bushes and trees. It's quiet.\n          \n                                      PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                           Hello?   Excuse me?\n          \n                 After a moment, Peter decides to check it out. As he steps\n                 around a bush, he suddenly stops, surprised to see --\n          \n                 PETER'S POV: two ARMS hang from a window at the side of the\n                 house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.\n          \n                                 Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      79A.\n          \n          \n          \n          It takes Peter a moment to recover.   He slowly walks over.\n          \n                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      80.\n          \n          \n          \n                A familiar BOY is inside -- it's TOSHIO. His glazed and\n                staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in\n                front of him.\n          \n                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                          Hello.\n          \n                No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this\n                boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house.\n          \n                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                          My name is Peter. I'm here to see\n                          your mother. Is she home?\n          \n                The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then\n                he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:\n          \n                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                          Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???\n          \n                Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle -\n                - it's unlocked. He opens the door.\n          \n          121                                                              121\n                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY\n                Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.\n          \n                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                              (calling out)\n                          Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.\n          \n                His concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes,\n                and quickly walks to the open bathroom door.\n          \n          \n          122                                                              122\n                OMITTED\n          \n          123   INT.

He must\n                have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window.\n          \n                                           Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        81.\n          \n          \n          \n                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                          Are you alright?\n          \n                As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the\n                bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water.\n          \n          \n          124   INT.

Where are your\n                          parents?\n          \n                The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed.\n          \n                Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms\n                and legs. There's also a big one around his neck.\n          \n                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)\n                          What happened to you?\n          \n                Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES,\n                pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter.\n          \n                Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat.\n          \n                Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans\n                the messy room, eyes falling on something.\n          \n                He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying\n                next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball.\n          \n                ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.\n                We've seen this picture before --\n          \n                -- a FAMILY PORTRAIT.

Peter looks over at the window.\n                Did that come from outside?\n          \n                Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out.\n          \n                FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's\n                face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning.\n                He looks outside, but can't see anything --\n          \n                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        82.\n          \n          \n          \n                -- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now\n                LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide --\n          \n                -- the MEOWING emitting from his wide open mouth --\n          \n          \n          125   INT.

The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.\n          \n          They all have red lines drawn through them.\n          \n          Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a\n          longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,\n          JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and\n          IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.\n          \n          Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --\n          \n          -- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.

The only one left.\n          \n          Karen puts down her pen.

Walks over to it. The flashing red light\n          is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --\n          \n          -- HER ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message light is blinking.\n          \n          `1 MESSAGE'.\n          \n          She reaches out a shaky finger and presses `PLAY'.\n          \n                               DOUG (ON MACHINE)\n                     \"Hey, Karen.

His attention is drawn to something\n                near the door --\n          \n                -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's\n                personal work space.\n          \n                Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.\n                Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and\n                son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.\n          \n                KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.\n          \n                Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a\n                familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.\n                He opens it.\n          \n                                   Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.\n          \n          \n          \n          HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through\n          it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...\n          \n          ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we\n          recognize, that she's written repeatedly --\n          \n          -- \"Peter\". It's been written over and over, in both English\n          and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.\n          \n          Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more\n          manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,\n          KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.\n          \n          Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of\n          his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled\n          hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.\n          \n          A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.\n          \n          Peter slams the book shut and drops it.
