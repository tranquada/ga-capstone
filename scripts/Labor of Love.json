The serpentine\nline of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of\nORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass\nand twisted metal.\n\nWe are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance\nand four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved\nin the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front\ncaved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the\ncar.\n\nThe second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN\nHONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that\nseparates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.\nAll the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot\nlength of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded\nback into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through\nthe sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,\npurple, swollen and bloody.\n\nSome drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have\nwalked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back.\n\n                    POLICE OFFICER\n          Get back in your cars and continue\n          with the traffic.

Ran a\n          license check.  Her name is Ellen\n          Parker.  Forty-two years old.\n\n                    OFFICER PIERCE\n          What about him?\n\nPierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind\nhis back and being led to a police car.\n\n                    OFFICER DANA\n          D.U.I.\n\n                    OFFICER PIERCE\n          Shit... How old is he?\n\n                    OFFICER DANA\n          Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's\n          car.  On his way back from drinking\n          with the 'boys'.\n\nPierce lets it sink in.\n\n                    OFFICER PIERCE\n          Who do we contact for her?\n\nDana checks the papers in her hand.\n\n                    OFFICER DANA\n          Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They\n          live in Wynnewood.  Married\n          seventeen years.\n\nPierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE.\nBeat.\n\n                    OFFICER PIERCE\n          There isn't any good left in the\n          world, Dana.

MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a\nheart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of\nwoman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age.\n\nShe carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the\nmiddle loaf.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          That one.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING\n\nTwenty minutes later.  The basket of the \"chosen\" raisin\nbread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it\nwith a cloth napkin.\n\nThe eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast.\nA stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's\nshoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey\nfeathers and a cherry red tail.\n\nThe DOOR BELL RINGS.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nFRONT DOOR\n\nwhere a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS.\nClaude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory,\nspreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man\nscans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs.\nA dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately\nframed and hung.\n\nEllen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a\ndeep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to\nthe open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A\nGLIMPSE of a man dressing.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nKITCHEN\n\nWhere Ellen and her husband are eating breakfast.  Claude is\nnow in a cage in the hallway.\n\nMR. MAURICE PARKER eats a buttered piece of raisin bread.  He\nis a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his New\nYork Times folded into a manageable rectangle.  This is a man\nwho has been seated a great deal of his life... the type of\nman who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage.\n\nHe feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that\nglowing smile.  He smiles back.\n\nEllen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now\ndisplayed proudly on the window ledge.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Yes?\n\n                    ELLEN\n          The flowers... they're beautiful.\n\nMaurice studies them.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          They are... who sent them?\n\nBeat.

I know it's not\n          New Years, because you'd be going\n          on and on about wearing a tuxedo\n          and how much you don't like to\n          dance... and I'm sure it's not our\n          anniversary, because I didn't find\n          an envelope with a hundred dollars\n          cash on my bureau with a note that\n          says, 'Pick out something\n          pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm\n          virtually certain it's not a\n          special day today.\n\nEllen begins to eat.  Maurice stares at her...\n\n                    MAURICE\n          You're mad at me... You were\n          beaming a minute ago, but since I\n          didn't send the flowers... now\n          you're mad at me.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Why would I send flowers?

Ellen goes\nstraight for the blinds.  BURST OF LIGHT stab the room.\n\nThe spines of the BOOKS catch the light... rows and rows of\nbooks cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves.  This is an\nold-fashioned store with antique chairs at select places.  A\ncoffee table sits near the window with a set of deep\ncushioned sofa-chairs.  This store is a home...\n\nMaurice moves behind the counter and TURNS ON THE RADIO.\nCHOPIN FLOWS from the old speakers atop the corner shelves --\ndelicately.\n\nEllen opens the door to the store and locks it in that\nposition with a slanted piece of wood...

Maurice's eyes drift\nto a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the\nstore.  One boy disappears behind \"Philosophy\" and reappears\nmomentarily with his sweat-shirt zipped up to his neck -- a\nrectangle is outlined under his shirt.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I see that!\n\nMaurice comes around the corner -- the boys HAUL ASS out of\nthe store.

He is wearing a PARKER\nBOOKS T-shirt underneath.  He pins an \"Assistant Manager\" tag\non.\n\nMaurice thinks to himself.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Lizy, Eliza...

Her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers.\nShe speaks without turning around.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Why do you polish that thing all\n          the time?\n\n                    MAURICE\n          You're talking to me?\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Why do you polish it?\n\nMaurice studies the impressive silver medallion.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          A Book Society Award is a very\n          prestigious thing.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Why are you polishing it -- in bed\n          -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at\n          night?  Are you going to show it to\n          someone?\n\n                    MAURICE\n          No.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Then why?\n\n                    MAURICE\n          There's no reason.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion.\n          It just makes you feel good to do\n          something for it, to express your\n          pride and affection for it some\n          how...\n              (beat)\n          How come you'd do that for a piece\n          of metal and not for me?\n\nMaurice has no answer.  He just stares at his hands.\n\nELLEN'S face can be seen under the covers facing away from\nMaurice.  Her eyes are red.  The tears roll off her nose and\nland on the pillow unseen and unheard.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING\n\nThe kitchen table is mockingly empty.  No bread.  Not even a\ncrumb.  Maurice, dressed for work, eyes the table with great\nresolve.  He rubs his hands together ceremoniously.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I can do this.\n\nMaurice moves to the fridge and gets out two eggs, onions,\ngreen peppers and mushrooms.\n\nCLAUDE is chirping INCESSANTLY FROM THE HALL.\n\nThe pile teeters precariously in Maurice's arms as he moves\nto the counter.  Next the pans come out -- He tries to pull\nthe bottom pan from the cabinet --\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nBEDROOM\n\nEllen is seated in bed, arms crossed -- equal resolve in her\nface.  A LARGE METALLIC CRASH OF POTS ECHOES FROM DOWNSTAIRS.\nEllen grabs her robe.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nHALLWAY\n\nEllen gently takes Claude out of his cage.  She kisses him.\nThe bird, once frantic, instantly at peace.\n\n                    ELLEN\n              (whispering)\n          You missed mommie... worried when I\n          didn't come down... my baby... so\n          sweet.\n\nEllen feeds the bird as she peeks around the corner, careful\nnot to be seen.  Maurice is desperately trying to cook an out\nof control omelette.  It spills over the sides and SIZZLES on\nthe range top.  He tries to scoop it up with the pan, tilting\nit further -- further -- the entire omelette slides onto the\nrange.  Maurice frantically tries to wrangle it back in.  Man\nvs. Egg.  Man losing.\n\nEllen has to keep herself from laughing.  Her expression\nchanges to pity as she watches the chaos unfold.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

KITCHEN - MORNING\n\nA defeated Maurice is eating an apple.  He looks up with\nsurprise as Ellen walks into the kitchen from the back door,\na bag under her arm.  She glances at him and then moves to\nthe counter where she prepares the bread for serving.  Ellen\nlooks down into the trash to find the rebellious omelette\nsitting uneaten.\n\nThe bread gets laid out in its usual basket, in its usual\nmanner.  Maurice says nothing as Ellen pulls two eggs from\nthe fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert\nease.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Onions?\n\nMaurice smiles warmly at his wife's back before moving to her\nand hugging her from behind.  He whispers in her ear.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Why do you put up with me?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Love... has something to do with\n          it.\n\nMaurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn\nEllen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away\ngently and stares into his eyes.  Maurice looks very\nemotional.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I do love you... very, very much.\n\n                    ELLEN\n          Show me.\n\n                    MAURICE\n              (with all his heart)\n          I will -- I promise.\n\nEllen kisses Maurice and returns to the eggs.

The guard catches his stare and waves.\nMaurice is aglow...

He\nscribbles his signature quickly and let's the pen drop to the\ntable top as if all the energy drained from his body.  He\nlooks up to Carl with powerful eyes.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Every journey begins with one step\n          right?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    CARL\n          Enjoy your party Mr. Parker...

HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table.  The SOUNDS\nOF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten\nfriends and family have gathered.\n\nMaurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening\nto the drone of TED PRICE.\n\nEllen is not present.\n\n                    TED\n          ... So she says the \"L\" word, after\n          two dates, the \"L\" word!  She says\n          'Don't you believe in true love?\n          Love that can conquer all?'  I say,\n          'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're\n          clear on things, I think love these\n          days is shit.  It don't mean a\n          thing and it don't stand for\n          nothing.  Shit.'... You know what\n          she says, 'Fine, but how do you\n          feel about kids?'\n\nEveryone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE\nCURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and\nwatches as the car pulls past the house and around the\ncorner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his\nconcern and without missing a beat...\n\n                    MAURICE\n          It's nice to see you don't have any\n          scars from your divorce.\n\nThis brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER.\n\nTHE TELEPHONE RINGS.\n\nMaurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE\nMATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is\nMaurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always\nsmiling -- except at this moment.\n\nTed begins another one of his stories -- the words are\nincoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle\nturns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS\ninto the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the\ndoorway... Something is definitely wrong.\n\nMaurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen...\neternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again.  She looks\ndifferent -- ghostly.  She glances up for a fraction of a\nsecond locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks\naway.\n\nMaurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and\nwhispers in his ear.  Gerald changes instantly -- taking on\nthe same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice.\n\nTed's story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY...\n\n                    MAURICE\n          What's wrong?\n\nThe room goes SILENT as all eyes fall on Adelle and Gerald.\n\n                    GERALD\n              (shaking)\n          Maurice, can we go into the dining\n          room?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          What's happened to my wife?\n\nThis hits everyone in the room like a bomb.  A dread hangs\nover every passing second... Gerald crumbles under the\nmoment... Adelle begins to cry.\n\n                    GERALD\n          There was a car accident... Drunk\n          driver.\n\nSome of the crowd reacts.  A women covers her mouth.

I don't\n          know how to --\n\nGerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if\ntrying to contain an explosion in his head.\n\n                    GERALD\n          Oh Jesus, please help me... She\n          didn't... Ellen didn't make it...\n          Ellen's dead Maurice.\n\nMaurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared\nof the dark.\n\nAdelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way\nto the ground.  In less than a minute the room has\ntransformed from a celebration to a mourning.  Everyone is\nfrozen staring at Maurice for their cue... A child in her\nmother's arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances.\n\nEXTREME CLOSE UP.  Maurice opens his eyes slowly.  The room\nstays still as Maurice stares at Ellen's HAT sitting on the\npiano.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

Maurice gets\nabout ten feet past them when he stops, hesitates and then\nheads back to them.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Excuse me, who's truck is this?\n\nThe man sitting on the hood of the truck, has dark hair and\nhasn't shaven in days.

The SOUNDS OF A CAR GROW IN THE DISTANCE.\nMaurice doesn't turn his back.\n\nThe CANARY YELLOW TRUCK pulls over the ridge with a load full\nof passengers.  It gains distance on Maurice.\n\nMaurice hears the ENGINE and waves HIS ARM IN THE AIR --\nsignaling for it to pass him.  Maurice walks ten more feet\nbefore turning around.\n\nMaurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented\ngrins through the windshield of the truck.  Maurice turns and\nquickens his pace... The truck picks up pace... Maurice\nbreaks into a run... The truck speeds up, passes Maurice and\nstops in front of him.\n\nPanic fills Maurice as he watches the truck unload it's\ndrunken passengers.  Eyes scan the forest on either side for\na way out.  Maurice decides to stand his ground.\n\n                    MAURICE\n              (to himself)\n          This is Indiana -- nothing's going\n          to happen to you.\n\n                    DENNY\n          You need a ride, Preacher?\n\nThe men walk up to Maurice.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          No thank you I'll walk.\n\nA tall lanky gentleman gestures to Maurice's shoulder bag\nwith his beer can.

Coming up to\n          me and my friends?  Looking like he\n          wanted to kick my ass for drinking?\n\nDenny gives Maurice that inhuman stare.  Maurice is clearly\nfrightened.\n\n                    DENNY\n          Then I figured it.  You're angry.\n          You lost somebody, because some\n          asshole was drinking.\n\nMaurice is frozen.\n\n                    DENNY\n          Maybe you lost a son?  A sister?

Maurice spots a\nYELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with\nvivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch.\nHe walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The\nbird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the\nbird.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Ellen would have loved you.\n\nMaurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.

Occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of\nextreme pain.\n\nMaurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road\nand watches the wind change the fields.

Maurice take a\ncouple deep breaths before laying back down.\n\nHis feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets.\nThey look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen\nand bruised.

The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice,\nburied deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around.\nHis breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak\nsmile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure.\nPeaceful.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side\nof the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the\npassenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves\nback.\n\nAnother CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises\nover the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast.\n\nSLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow\n-- the driver desperately trying to gain control...

It flips from the impact...\nsliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the\nroad... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away.\n\nSILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds.\n\nMaurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are\nSHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one\ncan be seen inside the vehicle.\n\nMaurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his\nhand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face\ngrimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly...\n\nA few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks\nthrough the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She\nlets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by\nthe wrist.\n\nMaurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.\n\n                    MAURICE\n              (panting)\n          It's okay.

He looks dazed.\n\nMaurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in\nthe snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against\nthe snow, almost laying flat on the ground.\n\n                    MAURICE\n              (frantic)\n          Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt.\n\nMaurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a\nPOWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a\nwoman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then\nthe body spills out onto the road next to Maurice.\n\nThe driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it\nwhen he sees them.\n\n                    DRIVER\n          It wasn't my fault.

He rubs\nhis calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head\nleans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep.\n\nThe SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.

He went to\n          every game and sat in the stands\n          with his glove.\n\n                    ISAAC\n          You know what... maybe I ran onto\n          the field and hit a home run.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Who's telling this story?\n\nIsaac points to Maurice.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Good, now the team had this great\n          big player -- Big Billy.  He was\n          the best.  He had them in the World\n          Super-Bowl-Championship of little\n          kids baseball.  But right before\n          the game, the second best player on\n          the team was suspended because he\n          played a prank on a nice man who\n          owned a book store... When that boy\n          grew up he was convicted on\n          burglary charges and spent fifteen\n          years in prison -- where he\n          belongs.\n\nIsaac didn't understand that last part.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Anyway, Big Billy needed another\n          player so he yelled into the\n          stands.  'Who can play baseball?'\n          And there was a little voice that\n          yelled out, 'Me, I can play.'\n          Everyone turned to see a little boy\n          standing with a glove.\n\n                    ISAAC\n              (beaming)\n          That's me.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Right.  But everyone saw how small\n          Isaac was and laughed... but not\n          Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac\n          carefully and then told him to join\n          the game.  It came to the end of\n          the game.  It was the eleventh or\n          twelfth inning or whatever is the\n          last inning of a game...\n\n                    ISAAC\n          Nine.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was\n          losing and he was on base.  That's\n          when Isaac came up.  He could\n          barely hold the bat... Big Billy\n          winked at Isaac... The ball was\n          pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard.\n          It soared up and out over the\n          stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac\n          hit a home run and won the game.\n          After the game, Isaac asked Big\n          Billy why he let he play.  Big\n          Billy smiled and said, I wasn't\n          always Big Billy, I was Little\n          Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy\n          went off after the game and read a\n          classic book together.  The end.\n\n                    ISAAC\n          You know what -- that was a really\n          good story...

HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway.  The\nblack tar from the road melting slightly.\n\nNo sign of Maurice.  WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in\nsight.  WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road.\nThere we see a figure lying still in the shade of an\noverhanging rock formation.\n\nMaurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on\nhis shoulder bag.  He is fast asleep.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nDUSK\n\nThe SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding\nbehind the horizon.

Maurice turns to see a\nwave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road.\nThey CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.  Maurice\nwalks down the center of the highway away from the hillside.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  HIGHWAY - DAWN\n\nTHE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.  Maurice\nlooks bad.  He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep\nincline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose\ndirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment.\n\nHe makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough\nroom to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He\npries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every\ninch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers\nand painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries\nto unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep.\n\nMaurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the\nhill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape\nfrom the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK\nBECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A\nFRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there.\n\nMaurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty\nfive feet above the ground.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nMID-DAY\n\nAnother sizzler.  Temperatures in the nineties.  The sun is\ndirectly overhead.\n\nMaurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the\nrock.\n\nA STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK...\nA SLIGHT TREMOR...\nTHEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK...\n\nMaurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping\nat the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands\ndesperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up\nspeed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see\na small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for\npanic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the\nrock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the\nslope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,\nclutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.\n\nMaurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still\ntrickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the\nfirst few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic.\n\nMaurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains\ncausing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest,\nbefore working his way to his feet.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nMaurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a\nseat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His\nbreathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering\nhis rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through\nthe spaces between his fingers.\n\nMaurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg\ngoes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg\ninstantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to\nthe back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge\nof tears.\n\nHe glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE\nmiles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his\ndirection.\n\nMaurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat\nfalling into his eyes.\n\n                    MAURICE\n              (whisper)\n          It's over Ellen... I failed you\n          again.\n\nMaurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing\nlarger.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I tried Ellen, I really tried... I\n          don't have the strength.\n\nThe cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the\nsky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks.\nMaurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          You said I would never be alone!...\n          You promised...\n              (his yelling turns to\n               sobs)\n          ... You promised.\n\nMaurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS\nHEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears...\n\nThere, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically\non the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half\nfeet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand\nlike a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle\nshade on Maurice's face.\n\nMaurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows\nin his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered\neagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is\nbreathtaking.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nROAD\n\nThe car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in\nseconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on\nthe side of the road.\n\nMaurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  The\ndriver gets out and calls over the hood.\n\n                    DRIVER\n          Hey, man are you okay?\n\nMaurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through the\npain.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I'm fine.\n\n                    DRIVER\n          What the hell are you doing out\n          here?  You need a ride somewhere?\n\n                    MAURICE\n          No thank you.\n\nThe driver is concerned.  He opens the driver door.\n\n                    DRIVER\n          You by yourself?\n\nBeat.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          No.\n\nThis pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the\ncar.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away.\n\nHe turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice\nlooks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying\noverhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.\n\nMaurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.\nMaurice takes his first step...\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

RAY\n          The normal amount of build up in\n          your arteries has been aggravated\n          by over exertion.  This is called,\n          \"Claudication,\"  As a result, there\n          isn't enough circulation to your\n          body.  That accounts for the\n          discoloration in your extremities\n          and the muscle spasms I'm sure\n          you've encountered.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Can it kill me?\n\n                    DR.

He barely manages to get the words out.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          It has nothing to do with you\n          either... This is between Ellen and\n          me.\n\nBeat.  Maurice begins crying uncontrollably.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          I'm begging you...\n\nMaurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to\nher hand as if getting blessings from her.\n\n                    MAURICE\n          Let me do this for Ellen, let me do\n          this for my wife.\n\nAdelle's heart is breaking.  She weeps openly as she\nstraightens her Uncle to an upright position.  She wipes the\ntears from his eyes with her hand gently.\n\nAT THAT MOMENT THE INNER CIRCLE BREAKS OPEN AS TWO OFFICERS\nRUSH IN.  They reach for Maurice.\n\n                    ADELLE\n          Touch him, and they'll be a riot...\n\nAdelle stands firm, the strength in her growing with each\nsecond.\n\n                    ADELLE\n          ... and I'll start it.\n\nThe officers are taken off guard.  They look around at the\ncountless sea of eyes on them.  Adelle sees they won't do\nanything and moves to Maurice's side.\n\nMaurice begins to walk again.  Adelle to one side, Kris to\nthe other and thousands of people following in step.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BEACH FRONT - DAY\n\nThe wave of people led by Maurice walk toward the beach.  The\nbeach is blocked off by barricades all along it's perimeter.\nPolice officers stand every ten feet along it's edge.\n\nA young officer watches fearfully as the ocean of people move\ntowards him.  OFFICER GANTZ TALKS INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE.\n\n                    GANTZ\n          He's coming.  What should I do?\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nSERGEANT EMORY\n\nat the other end of the beach barricade, holding back\nhundreds of people trying to get to the beach.  Emory holds\nhis walkie-talkie and looks around at the sea of anxious\nfaces.  He makes eye contact with a woman in tears.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nOFFICER GANTZ\n\nclicking off his walkie-talkie as the crowd presses up to the\nbarricade.  Officer Gantz is in awe as Maurice appears from\nthe crowd -- looking like a ghost of war... a holy\napparition.  Maurice works his way painfully to Gantz.\n\nGantz looks into Maurice's pleading eyes.  Maurice tries to\nsay something, but nothing can come out...\n\nGantz turns away from Maurice and picks up one of the\nbarricades.  He makes an opening about three feet wide.\nGantz turns back to Maurice, stands at attention, and steps\naside.\n\n                    GANTZ\n              (with unspeakable\n               admiration)\n          Watch your step Mr. Parker.\n\nAdelle and Kris watch in amazement as Maurice TAKES HIS FIRST\nSTEP ONTO THE SAND.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\n\nAn empty beach.  ALL SOUND AND CHAOS DISAPPEARS.  THE GENTLE\nHISS OF THE OCEAN FILLS THE AIR.\n\nThe last fifty yards...\n\nThe steps in the sand, heavy, torturous.  Each step, a step\ncloser to her...\n\nMaurice picks up the pace.  His numb feet making prints in\nthe sand.  His lungs on fire...\n\nTwenty feet left... Ten... Five...\n\nThe COOL WATER engulfs his feet and ankles.  Maurice falls to\nhis knees like a man falling before God.\n\nKneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.\nThe water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.\n\nMaurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.  The water\ncomes in and washes over him... Gasping harder... He's\nstaring into the sky... Another wave of ocean gently blankets\nhim... Gasp... He spots something above him, fluttering...\nhis vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION.  THE\nIMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a\nWHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM...\n\nMaurice takes a short breath, very short.  His body goes\nstill -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no\nmore loss, no more words...\n\nThe water washes over Maurice A. Parker...\nOver his lifeless body...\nAnd over his smile...\n\n                                           FADE TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor of Love\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0M.
