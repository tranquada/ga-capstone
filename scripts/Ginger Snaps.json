GIRLS' BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE\n          FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in\n          underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have\n          cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have\n          pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte\n          has blue nail polish on.

Quit dickin' around.\n          Jus' do it.\n          Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton\n          ball in rubbing alcohol.\n          Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her\n          own shirt up to expose her navel.\n          Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her\n          eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           2\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          Ginger's ten months older than\n          me. we're seriously tight. Share\n          everything. Everything.\n          Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the\n          door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with\n          paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's\n          and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with\n          Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid\n          of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding\n          Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf.\n          Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle.

Blood wells up around it.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man.\n          There's blood...\n          Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle\n          half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           3\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          snot funny, Ginger!\n          Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug\n          from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Ali, gawd, gross.\n          Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.\n\n          GINGER\n          I got it, I got it.\n          Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.\n\n          GINGER\n          It's goin', it's goin'- gimme\n          the ring\n          Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but\n          knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger\n          yanks the needle.\n\n          GINGER\n          Bee?! C'mon!\n          Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets\n          the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly\n          through.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Oh, groo-oo-o-ss!\n          The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to\n          close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte\n          is taking deep, gulping breaths.\n\n          GINGER\n          Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Yeah.

But,\n          at fifteen? A chick can change.\n          Ya know?\n          [3A! You got no idea.\n\n          EXT. THE FTTZGERALD BACKYARD - DAY\n\n          It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia. Birds sing. The\n          terrier next door (NORMAN) barks and barks.\n          A pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood.\n          Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence. Blood\n          is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest:\n          Ginger's impaled on a white picket.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          Don't get me wrong. It's not\n          like we were all happy or\n          nothin' to begin with.\n          Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -\n          unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound. Brigitte eyes\n          the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the\n          horizon.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          The suburb of Bailey Downs?\n          Basically a well lit black hole.\n          The Kingdom of cul du sac.\n          That's French for Dead End.\n          Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves.\n          It smolders then goes out.

Life bit the big one.\n          A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a\n          few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed\n          Adonis - SAM -- climb out of the cab.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          Of course I'm generalizing.\n          A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him\n          a big wet one.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/0)\n          No I'm not.\n\n          GINGER\n          The fuck, Bee. Take a picture\n          already.\n          Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her\n          sister's corpse in the viewfinder.\n\n          ROLL HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE:\n          snap!

BAILEY HIGH ART ROOM - DAY\n\n          The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art\n          class, just finishing the slide show from the credit\n          sequence. An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto\n          the collapsible screen at the front of the room.\n          The homely ART TEACHER looks very concerned as she hits the\n          lights. The other STUDENTS \u00e2\u0080\u00a2-- all about fifteen, middle-class\n          and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence.

A\n          horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a\n          split second in the light.\n          The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,\n          snarling..

They glance over their shoulders, even as they\n          disappear into a new residential stretch.\n          The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in\n          the road, it's front end smashed.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           26\n          Sam slowly opens the cab door.

ANOTHER HALLWAY - LATE DAY\n\n          Brigitte walks fast, looking for a place for the body.\n          She looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up. Too\n          small.\n          She looks up at a loose ceiling panel. She jumps a few times\n          trying to reach it. Too high. She gets an idea.\n          Brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym.\n\n          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - MEANWHILE\n\n          A JANITOR pushes his cart toward the guidance office. He\n          stops at another door, produces keys, and lets himself in.\n          He returns with a trash can and empties into his bin. He\n          replaces the can, closes the door and locks it.\n\n          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - MEANWHILE\n\n          Ginger, gnaws on Mr. Wayne's arm but really isn't enjoying\n          it. She stops in mid-chew and listens. The janitor's\n          footsteps approach: his cart wheels squeak\n\n          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY\n\n          The janitor wheels up to the guidance office. He slides this\n          key in the lock.\n\n          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good\n          hand, her feet braced against the wall on either side.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           74\n          On the other side, the janitor tugs, and tugs again.\n          Ginger's getting madder the more he persists.\n          The janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open.\n\n          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY\n\n          Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls\n          around a corner.\n          The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for\n          help, blood spurting from his slashed throat. He tries to\n          cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his\n          Qi s passing through blood.\n          Ginger walks behind him as he crawls. Ginger applies her boot\n          to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore.\n          Ginger giggles.\n          Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion\n          at her. For a split second, Ginger stops cold. Ginger seems\n          to falter before her sister's horror.\n          Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even\n          seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's\n          fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps.\n          Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't.\n          Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws. Ginger\n          shakes her head, as if to say I can't help it.. .Ginger\n          pounces on the man. Brigitte turns her face to the wall.\n          The lanitor makes a final horrible noise. The halls fall\n          silent.\n\n          MONTAGE: INT.

She starts\n          running with it toward through the frosted glass window of\n          the main office with a triumphant war whoop.\n          Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target.\n\n          GINGER\n          Move!\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          STOP IT! Just stop. Enough,\n          Ginger. Please. Please.\n          Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive\n          out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte.\n          Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the\n          hall looking for more mischief.\n          Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her\n          lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs.\n          OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger cont.inuing her ram a e else where\n          in the school. Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart,\n          looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched.\n          Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.\n          She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in\n          her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into\n          the air, the taste making her heave instinctively. she dry\n          heaves a couple of times. She throws the bottle at the wall.\n\n          INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT\n\n          Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and\n          heading for the exit. They stop dead at the doors.\n\n          EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - NIGHT\n\n          A truck's headlights pin them in full view. Ginger rolls her\n          sleeve down over her paw.

GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens\n          it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed\n          has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          I'd get the monkshood from my\n          locker at school the next\n          morning.\n          Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on.\n          Empty.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          I'd find Ginger, I'd find out if\n          the stuff even worked.\n          Brigitte locks the window shut.

You know,\n          if the sun came up.\n          Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She\n          lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on\n          the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at\n          Halloween, taken many years before.\n          The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday.

Ginger snorts, and\n          climbs into her own bed.\n          Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and\n          locked. The bureau is still in front of the door.

The\n          sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom.\n          She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She\n          tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see.\n          She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms\n          down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's\n          fingers skip under her skirt.\n          Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under\n          there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening.\n          She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly\n          washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs.\n\n          INT.

She turns on the\n          lights.\n          Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is\n          deserted. No Sam. No sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore.\n          Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor.\n          Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body. The boys in\n          costume crowd in behind him.\n\n          HENRY\n          Pamela, honey, it's just a\n          prank, you know how they...\n          (he fingers some\n\n          GORE)\n          Holy mother of - it's warm.\n          Where are my kids?!!\n\n          GUY WITH AX IN THE HEAD\n          Ginger went in here with Sam\n          McDonald a while back.\n\n          HENRY\n          Sam McDonald?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           104\n\n          GUY WITH EYE MISSING\n          Yeah, you know. The guy they\n          thought was the Beast, but they\n          let 'im go.\n          Henry steps into the room. He spots a bloody trail up to the\n          open ground-level window.\n\n          EXT FITZGERALD HOME - NIGHT\n          Tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck\n          lurches out of its parking spot.\n\n          INT. TRUCK - NIGHT\n\n          Brigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an\n          amateur's hand. Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar\n          bills is on the seat next to her.\n          Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the\n          dark back of the truck.\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          Plans, plans arc good. 'Course I\n          hardly had one. Adrenaline\n          though, adrenaline is pretty\n          speedy shit.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Ginger?! Don't eat the body\n          okay? I got this idea, an'\n          we'll need Sam.\n          Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac\n          to the main road.\n\n          EXT. STREETS/TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\n          The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly. Sirens\n          rise around it.\n\n          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT\n\n          Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors\n          trying to see where the sirens are coming from.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           105\n          Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite\n          direction. Heading back to the Fitzgerald house.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Ha! All rightie then.\n          Brigitte drives on.\n          What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses\n          of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street\n          lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place:\n          FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.\n          FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen.\n          FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout.\n          FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white\n          fangs.\n\n          EXT. THE HILLCREST - NIGHT\n\n          The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs -\n          the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here.\n          You could almost touch it.\n\n          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT\n\n          Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights\n          of the homes below them creep into view.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          okay, Ginger? They'll think that\n          Sam took us from our room,\n          right? 'Cause of his record an,\n          the arrest, right? We're gonna\n          make this look like he did, any\n          ways. He got us, maybe killed\n          us, took our bodies to do some\n          unspeakable thingy. But then?\n          Sam killed himself. You follow?\n          Ginger doesn't answer.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           106\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          So boom, diversion. Meanwhile\n          you an, me hit the highway. we\n          can hitch, get you cleaned up.\n          By the time the find out we\n          weren't in Sam's clutches at\n          all, we could be any wheres.\n          Yeah? Whatcha think?\n          Ginger doesn't answer.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          It'll work. (I hope.)\n          Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine.\n\n          EXT. THE TRUCK/HILLCREST - NIGHT\n\n          Brigitte climbs out of the cab. She moves to the back doors\n          of the truck, and opens them. In the inky darkness inside,\n          she hears heavy panting.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Ginger? C'mon, we got move.\n          Shove Sam down here.\n          Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on\n          its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet.\n          An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out,\n          clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we\n          can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much\n          like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte.\n          Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free\n          and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the\n          truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up\n          at her.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Stop. I mean it.\n          It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides,\n          dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground.\n\n          JUMP TO:\n          Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her\n          Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.\n          The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte\n          watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into\n          the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           107\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Nice one.\n          Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the\n          ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool\n          trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily,\n          shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the\n          moonlight.\n\n          INT. TREES/HILLCREST - NIGHT\n\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin'\n          trail much? Could leave\n          everybody a fuckin' map...\n          Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and\n          trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          I won't hurt you if you don't\n          hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay?\n          Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she\n          approaches it.\n          It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail\n          are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her\n          sister, frantic with grief.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean\n\n          TO\n          It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in\n          her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but\n          can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly.\n          Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning.\n\n          BRIGITTE\n          You can't, you can't, we're out.\n          You can't, don't don't do this\n          to me. Not now. Look, look it's\n          all taken care of. we're\n          Unsolved Mysteries!\n\n          EXT. A HIGHWAY - PRE-DAWN\n\n          The sunrise has the sky this bloody red.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           108\n          Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the\n          road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS!\n\n          BRIGITTE (V/O)\n          We made it out. There was this\n          road? An' the space between\n          here and where ever. I did it.\n          Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human\n          form. Because Ginger is dead.\n\n          EXT. A HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING\n\n          In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of\n          dirt over Ginger's shallow grave.\n          Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath\n          the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES.\n          Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily.\n          Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi\n          appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her\n          thumb.\n          The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to\n          arrive before her.\n          ROLL TAIL CREDITS as:\n          Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED\n          MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious\n          disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who\n          disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet\n          suburb of Bailey Downs.\n          Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized\n          events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out\n          their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have\n          reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's\n          perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong,\n          a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one\n          can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the\n          scene of their last crime...\n          At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the\n          traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          1 09\n\n          VOICE OF UNSOLVED MYSTERIES\n          Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald\n          are considered armed and\n          dangerous.
