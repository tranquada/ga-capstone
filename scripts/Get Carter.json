PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT\n\n               Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, \n               alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy \n               satin curtains close, wiping him from view.\n\n               INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One \n               pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the \n               opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some \n               anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual \n               orgy. \n\n               GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, \n               is curled up beside him. \n\n               SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, \n               has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. \n\n               Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. \n\n               Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting \n               turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged \n               leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his \n               touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.\n\n                                     GERALD\n                              (removing the cigar \n                              from his mouth)\n                         Bollock naked with his socks still \n                         on?\n\n                                     SID\n                              (thoughtfully)\n                         They do that up North.\n\n                                     GERALD\n                         What for?

It's his old stamping \n                         ground.\n\n               Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights \n               and sweet music happen when he opens it. \n\n               Clunk.

There is \n               definitely something between them. \n\n                                     JACK\n                         No.  \n\n               Clunk.

RAIL TRACK - DAY\n\n               Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. \n\n               BEGIN TITLES:\n\n               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY\n\n               The compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, \n               reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely.\n\n               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY\n\n               The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of \n               a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown \n               smoke.\n\n               INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor.\n\n               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY\n\n               A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its \n               mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.\n\n               INT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY\n\n               Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his \n               nose.\n\n               EXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING\n\n               The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts \n               across the track as the train hurtles on.\n\n               INT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING\n\n               Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small \n               phial of brown pills. He swallows one.\n\n               EXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT\n\n               A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the \n               outskirts of the city appear.\n\n               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter \n               collects his coat and briefcase from the rack.\n\n               EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The street is fairly deserted.  \n\n               Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses \n               and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.\n\n               INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT\n\n               A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An \n               old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper.  \n\n               Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN \n               comes to serve him.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Pint of bitter.\n\n               The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the \n               beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         In a thin glass.  \n\n               The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a \n               thin glass and puts it on the counter.\n\n               A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. \n\n                                     BARMAN\n                         Is there a Mr Carter in the room? \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Yes.\n\n               Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the \n               receiver.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Hello?\n                              (pause)\n                         Margaret?\n                              (pause)\n                         Why the hell aren't you here?\n                              (he lights a \n                              cigarette.)\n                         What time?\n                              (pause)\n                         Is Doreen at the house?\n                              (pause)\n                         Who's with him then?\n                              (pause)\n                         When can I see you?

Carter hangs up.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT\n\n               A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards \n               and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. \n               Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in \n               a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs \n               the stairs.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT \n\n               Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling \n               wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits \n               an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a \n               dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a \n               vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the \n               ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking \n               up. They see him and quickly drive off.\n\n               Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's \n               an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories \n               flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of \n               cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He \n               leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Pitch black.\n\n               An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK \n               CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his \n               skin made-up, like porcelain.\n\n               Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his \n               brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. \n               He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. \n\n               Darkness returns.\n\n               INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT\n\n               The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's \n               well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his \n               baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I won't be using the room tonight.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                              (stops and turns)\n                         I see.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I'm staying with a friend.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                              (continuing up the \n                              stairs)\n                         Her husband docks tomorrow, does \n                         he?  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (smiles)\n                         It's not like that, luv.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         It never is.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room \n               overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably. \n\n               Edna and Carter enter, talking. \n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Are you a traveller?  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (smiling)\n                         Definitely.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                              (surveying the room)\n                         Will this do?  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (looking around)\n                         Very nice.

FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric \n               razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               The coffin lid is being screwed down.  \n\n               Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the \n               undertakers at work.  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Was he in bad shape?  \n\n                                     UNDERTAKER\n                         They come worse.\n\n               INT. HEARSE - DAY\n\n               The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A \n               youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks \n               through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. \n\n               DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, \n               tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's \n               cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank.  \n               There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. \n               The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.\n\n               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the \n               coffin. Carter sees her.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Doreen?  \n\n               She seems mesmerized by what's going on.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         All right, are you?  \n\n               Doreen doesn 't answer.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Been staying with a friend?  \n\n               Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another \n               screw into the coffin.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Sorry about your father.\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                              (pause)\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Tell me, Doreen, did the police \n                         say anything?\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                              (dazed)\n                         They said he was drunk.\n\n               INT. HEARSE - DAY\n\n               The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to \n               the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover \n               moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men \n               suss the scene and drive off.\n\n               INT.

FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow \n               staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait \n               with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing \n               a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a \n               young barman who worked with Frank.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         We weren't sure where it was taking \n                         place, like.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Nice of you to come.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         No. Frank was a good bloke.\n\n                                     KEITH\n                         He was that.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         One of the best.\n\n               INT.

Sitting in front \n               on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.\n\n                                     KEITH\n                         I couldn't believe it when I heard.  \n                         Carter is suddenly attentive.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         What?  \n\n                                     KEITH\n                         I mean, I was surprised when he \n                         didn't turn up for work.

A bloody funny thing!\n\n               EXT. CREMATORIUM GATES - DAY\n\n               As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the \n               Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed \n               Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking \n               funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.\n\n               INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY\n\n               Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing \n               the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is \n               already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' \n               when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts \n               through the silence. Everybody looks round.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (whispering to Doreen)\n                         Is that Margaret?  \n\n               Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.\n\n               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin \n               appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a \n               trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the \n               furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.\n\n               EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY\n\n               MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind \n               of way.  Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap \n               pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the \n               cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.  \n\n               Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Margaret.\n\n               Margaret stops and looks round.

Margaret looks past Carter \n               and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. \n               She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves \n               with her.  Margaret continues nervously.\n\n                                     MARGARET\n                         Everyhing go off all right? \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Fine...\n                              (pause)\n                         I want to talk to you. \n\n                                     MARGARET\n                         What about?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Doreen. \n\n               Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen. \n               She's still watching them.\n\n                                     MARGARET\n                              (adamantly)\n                         She's nothing to do with me. \n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (puzzled)\n                         What do you mean?

THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY\n\n               It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a \n               real boozer.  A handful of hard drinkers are already in \n               position.\n\n               Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their \n               table is already covered with glasses.

Ahead, two cars \n               are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. \n               The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.\n\n               INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen \n               with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open \n               and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results \n               come over the car radio.\n\n               INT.

A big man stands tossing stones \n               into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch \n               then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he \n               collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards \n               the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in \n               the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious \n               lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building \n               surrounded by acres of woodland.\n\n               Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. \n               One of the men notices and shouts after him.\n\n               INT.

Somewhere \n               a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley.\n\n               Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and \n               watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window \n               and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. \n               Reluctantly, she comes.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (gently)\n                         You all right now?\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You coming to South America?\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                         No.\n\n               Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection. \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Where you going to live, then? \n\n                                     DOREEN\n                         At me friend's house.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Where's that?\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                         Wilton Estate.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Nice family, are they?

Carter grabs it \n               and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it \n               against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over \n               his head. Blood spurts everywhere.  The driver panics. He \n               accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. \n               His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and \n               dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to \n               the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the \n               confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter \n               spots him and begins to run.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (roars)\n                         Thorpe!\n\n               Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance \n               hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.\n\n               INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT\n\n               The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, \n               their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical \n               music to match the dancing.\n\n               Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter \n               arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he \n               disappears down into the gents' lavatory.\n\n               INT. DANCE HALL - GENTS' LAVATORY - NIGHT\n\n               Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the \n               cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes \n               into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over \n               the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door. \n               Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe \n               jumps up, terrified.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Time's up, Thorpey.\n\n               Carter smiles.\n\n               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits. \n               Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter \n               and Thorpe come down the street.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Hello, Keith,\n                              (pause)\n                         Stay there, Thorpey.\n\n               He knocks on Edna's door.

It seems I've \n                         got a secret benefactor.\n                              (He moves into the \n                              room and opens his \n                              briefcase, which \n                              is lying on the \n                              bed.)\n                         It's nice to know that.

Suddenly \n               Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and \n               collapses into a chair.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Now, I want to know who it is, \n                         Thorpey.\n\n               Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues \n               wearily.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         All right. If you like, Thorpey, \n                         we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody \n                         doesn't want me poking my nose \n                         into something and I happen to \n                         know what that something is.\n                              (pause)\n                         Now stand up.\n\n               Thorpe looks at him, terrified.

Right along the \n                         coast.

THE PANTILES - NIGHT\n\n               It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the \n               road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, \n               with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, \n               porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang \n               over everything.\n\n               There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and \n               the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports \n               cars.\n\n               Carter parks and gets out.\n\n               Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily \n               pond.  There, he promptly throws up.\n\n               Carter watches from behind a tree.\n\n               His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the \n               drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.\n\n               CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably \n               dressed in tuxedo and white scarf.

A \n               young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a \n               latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Daddy!\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         That's right, bloody Daddy.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I wasn't expecting you until three \n                         o'clock.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         And this is what you call having a \n                         few friends back for coffee, is \n                         it?\n\n               Brumby pushes past her into the house.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         Running bloody riot over my bloody \n                         furniture, drinking my bloody \n                         booze...\n\n               The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers \n               out through the side door\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         ... spewing over my fucking \n                         goldfish.\n\n               He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him \n               face-down into the lily pond.\n\n               Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As \n               she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears \n               at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.\n\n                                     MRS BRUMBY\n                         Cliff ...\n\n               Brumby throws the boy out.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         Shut up, Phyllis.\n                              (He walks back into \n                              the house.)\n                         Sandra!\n\n               Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby \n               passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a \n               bedroom.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.\n\n               Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the \n               row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.\n\n               INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT\n\n               Carter passes silently through the hall into the large \n               sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. \n\n               Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Good evening.\n\n               Mrs Brumby jumps.

Carter sits in an \n               armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later \n               Brumby storms into the room.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         What the bloody hell's all this? \n\n               Carter doesn't move.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         You know what the bloody time is!\n                              (pause)\n                         It's two o'clock in the bloody \n                         morning!\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I know.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         Well? \n\n               Carter still doesn 't move.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         The wife says the Fletchers sent \n                         you.\n\n               Carter just looks at him.

Brumby stops him.\n\n                                     BRUMBY\n                         Bloody well tell me who sent you.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You're a big man, but you're in \n                         bad shape. With me, it's a full-\n                         time job. Now behave yourself.\n\n               Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, \n               then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck.  \n               Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.\n\n               Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Good night, Mrs Brumby.\n\n               EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He \n               finds the front door unlocked.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the \n               door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still \n               there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his \n               attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the \n               far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair \n               dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.  \n\n                                     EDNA\n                         You sod.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         They came back?\n\n                                     EDNA\n                              (sarcastically)\n                         No.\n\n               Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. \n               Edna looks at her torn dress.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Look at this.

The distant sound of the marching \n               band helps them surface.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Are you awake? \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         No.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Do you want breakfast? \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You must be joking. I never eat \n                         breakfast,\n                              (pause)\n                         Did you sleep well?  \n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner \n               a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Scene as before.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Did you sleep well?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Yes, thank you.\n\n               He puts his arm around her and moves on top.\n\n               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides \n               to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the \n               Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads. \n               They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It \n               opens.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Scene as before.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Are you tired?  \n\n                                     EDNA\n                         No. Are you tired?  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         No. I'm not tired,\n                              (pause)\n                         Do you eat breakfast? \n\n               Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the \n               undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside \n               it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens \n               slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.  \n\n                                     CON (O.S.)\n                         Put us in it, Jack.\n\n               Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams \n               and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to \n               the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. \n               Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide-\n               bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is \n               bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's \n               in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their \n               thirties.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I might have guessed.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Sorry about this. But there you \n                         are. Orders are orders.  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         And what orders would they be, \n                         Con?  \n\n               Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the \n               chamber pot instead of the gun.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Gerald phoned us in the middle of \n                         the night, said he'd heard you've \n                         been making a nuisance of yourself.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         We've got to take you back to \n                         London.\n\n                                     CON\n                         He said it'd be doing him a big \n                         favour.\n\n               Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on \n               towards the gun.\n\n                                     CON\n                         We know why you're all steamed up, \n                         and so do Gerald and Sid.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         But they have to be diplomatic.\n\n               Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Right.

He's naked.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Put it away, Jack. You know you \n                         won't use it.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         The gun he means.\n\n               Both men are laughing.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Out.\n\n               Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at \n               Carter's cock.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         If Anna could see you now.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Out.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know \n                         we're going to take you back - \n                         sooner or later.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Out.\n\n               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Con is the first to emerge from the front door.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Mind you don't catch cold.\n\n               Peter follows.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         I hope she's got understanding \n                         neighbours.\n\n               Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.\n\n                                     CON\n                         See you when you've got your drawers \n                         on.\n\n               The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out \n               for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The \n               bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep. \n               Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly \n               backs into the house.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket. \n               The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter \n               and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits.\n\n               Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Do us a favour?\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         What, and get myself beaten up \n                         again?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         No chance of that.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Not much.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         They're friends of mine.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         And that'll make me feel better?  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I don't want to get rough, do I?  \n\n               Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the \n               casket.\n\n               INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying \n               the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place \n               holding a handgun.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Hold it! Where do you think you're \n                         going?  \n\n               Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with \n               the shotgun.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Strawberry Fair.\n\n               He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's \n               yard.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         In.  Turn right. \n                              (He points the gun \n                              at the coalshed.)\n                         Open that door.\n\n               Con unbolts the door.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         And go inside.\n\n               Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves \n               quickly back to Edna and the car.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         What you going to do?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I'm going to sit in the car and \n                         whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.\n\n               Carter jumps into the car.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         You coming back?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         How could I stay away?\n\n               The car roars off.\n\n               EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see. \n               Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and \n               sheets on the windscreen.\n\n               EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY\n\n               The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It \n               finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley, \n               following after Carter.\n\n               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY\n\n               Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to \n               the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the \n               Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he \n               scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door \n               at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to \n               the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he \n               is out of sight.\n\n               Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         Where were you, then?  \n\n               Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.\n\n                                     CON\n                         Bollocks.\n\n               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY\n\n               Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the \n               washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected \n               garden.\n\n               EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY\n\n               Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, \n               SHAMIR.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Keith in?  \n\n                                     SHAMIR\n                              (shouts)\n                         Keith.\n\n               No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.\n\n                                     CARTER (O.S.)\n                         Which is his room?\n\n               INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY\n\n               Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, \n               his face like a piece of raw steak.

A steel mesh separates the \n               pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get \n               to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge.

He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to \n               a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives \n               chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.\n\n               EXT.

It's going to cut Carter off from his car.\n\n               A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars \n               into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him \n               just before the Jaguar and slows down.\n\n                                     GLENDA\n                         Over here, Jack.\n\n               Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, \n               so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.\n\n               The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming \n               Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing \n               the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.\n\n               Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at \n               the top of the hill.\n\n               INT.

Wires are hanging from the ceiling and \n               walls where the lights will eventually be fixed.\n\n               A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting \n               sun. He is just a silhouette.\n\n               Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The \n               silhouette turns as he nears it.

Not much rough stuff. \n                         It's a business that makes me very \n                         happy. But recently, I've had a \n                         spot of bother,\n                              (pause)\n                         One of my lads gets a bit over-\n                         anxious and flogs some machines in \n                         a club that's already got some. \n                         The upshot is I've had to eat shit \n                         and stop flogging my machines to \n                         other clubs.\n                              (pause)\n                         So far as I'm concerned, that's \n                         it. Apparently not. These people \n                         I've offended get the idea that it \n                         would be good to take over my whole \n                         outfit,\n                              (pause)\n                         So I'm worried.

GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda \n               has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the \n               floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and \n               a film projector stands close to the window, which has \n               makeshift curtains.\n\n               Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all \n               over the place.

Carter, curious, looks at \n               the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam \n               of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch \n               the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked \n               on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back \n               reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is \n               followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school \n               uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. \n               A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is \n               Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.\n\n               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still \n               running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off \n               the tap.\n\n               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft \n               porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.\n\n               The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. \n               The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes \n               in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. \n               Glenda is there to greet them.\n\n               The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, \n               sitting her down and showing her a magazine.\n\n               Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top \n               off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her \n               hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.\n\n               Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in \n               the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock \n               at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, \n               eventually rolling off the bed.\n\n               The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar \n               comes in.\n\n               Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.\n\n               Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.  \n               Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the \n               two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his \n               prize Doreen.  Carter watches.\n\n               Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in \n               the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off \n               his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. \n               Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old \n               and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that \n               drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.\n\n               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.  \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I want to give you an Oscar.\n\n                                     GLENDA\n                              (laughs)\n                         You've been watching the film.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Tell me about the girl.\n\n                                     GLENDA\n                         What girl?\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         The young girl.

What you talking \n                         about?\n\n               Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda \n               and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there. \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You're a lying bitch.\n\n               Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering, \n               nearly drowned.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Now tell me the truth.\n\n                                     GLENDA\n                         The girl's name was Doreen.

Now \n                         get up and get dressed.\n\n               He pushes her ahead of him.\n\n               EXT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY\n\n               Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the \n               boot.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Get in.\n\n               Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car \n               scorches away.\n\n               EXT. JETTY. TYNE FERRY - DAY\n\n               Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves \n               down the gangway towards it.\n\n               INT. CAFE - DAY\n\n               A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The \n               door slams open. There's Carter.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Where's Albert?\n\n               The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs \n               her by the throat.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Where's Albert?\n\n               The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as \n               he grabbed her.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I know where I'll find him.\n\n               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY\n\n               Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being \n               dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.\n\n                                     GIRL (V.O.)\n                         Eric, he's come for Albert,\n                              (pause)\n                         I don't know, (pause) On the ferry, \n                         I reckon.\n\n               Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.\n\n               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY\n\n               Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming \n               over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches \n               ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and \n               doesn't see him.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Hello, Albert.\n\n               Albert looks like he's going to be sick.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         Hello, Jack,\n                              (snivelling)\n                         I don't know anything, Jack.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll \n                         kill you.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         I know. I know.\n\n               Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the \n               toilets.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Do you want to go to the toilet, \n                         Albert?\n\n               At first Albert doesn't understand.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Do you want to go to the toilet, \n                         Albert?\n\n               This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter \n               follows.\n\n               EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY\n\n               Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He \n               reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and \n               he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him \n               down. Albert faces him.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You can't get away from me, Albert. \n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         I know.\n\n               He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         For Christ's sake, give us a fag.\n\n               Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         I didn't know who Doreen was. \n                         Thought she was just another bird.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Did Eric Pake pull her?\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         How?\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         I dunno.

There's a loud \n               click.  It's a. knife.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                         Jack, for Christ's sake ...\n\n               He falls to his knees.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         You knew what I'd do.\n\n                                     ALBERT\n                              (crying)\n                         Yes, but listen.

Albert \n               leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, \n               twitches, and is dead.\n\n               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY\n\n               Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to \n               the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.\n\n               EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY\n\n               The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter \n               arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down \n               the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging \n               across the water.\n\n               INT. FERRY - DAY\n\n               Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and \n               two young children take his attention. His look is tinted \n               with regret even remorse.\n\n               EXT. JETTY - DAY\n\n               As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up \n               to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter \n               standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun.\n\n               Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. \n               Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter \n               from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter \n               is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure.

Or are his eyes just that bit \n               sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. \n               Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.  \n\n               Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the \n               ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves \n               himself into position, Carter is waiting.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Stay where you are, Peter.\n\n               Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even \n               raise his shooter.\n\n                                     PETER\n                              (screaming)\n                         Don't.\n\n               There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he \n               cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he \n               hits the deck, he's dead.  \n\n               Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out \n               of range.\n\n                                     ERIC\n                         Carter, your car needs a wash.\n\n               Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the \n               Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.  \n               Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around \n               the sinking car.\n\n               Carter watches impassively.\n\n               EXT.

He takes a can of film from his pocket \n               and slips it into a large envelope.  At the counter two \n               women are talking.\n\n                                     FIRST WOMAN\n                         They don't know how it happened.\n\n                                     SECOND WOMAN\n                         How far did he fall?\n\n                                     FIRST WOMAN\n                         What did Betty say...

SWING-BRIDGE - EVENING\n\n               The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made \n               island in the middle of the river.\n\n               On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from \n               which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside \n               ladder. A man waits for him at the top.\n\n               The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it. \n               Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again \n               and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as \n               Carter disappears down the outside ladder.\n\n               INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT\n\n               The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The \n               atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards. \n               Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as \n               everybody starts talking again.\n\n               Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his \n               eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. \n               She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. \n\n               The next game starts up.\n\n               EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the \n               evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. \n               Carter follows them and turns up a side street.\n\n               EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT\n\n               The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the \n               steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. \n               Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her \n               friend chat for a moment and part.\n\n               Carter follows Margaret.\n\n               EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n               The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She \n               appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another \n               dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home \n               Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding \n               Con's handgun.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I've come for you, Margaret.\n\n               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly \n               rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. \n               Different things are obviously going on in different rooms \n               in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, \n               etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on \n               the phone.

Take your clothes off.  Margaret \n               does just that: coat, blouse, skin.

She struggles, her eyes \n               moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by \n               the gag.  Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.  \n               Carter removes the gag.

He stubs out the cigarette and \n               switches off the light. Darkness.\n\n               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n\n               Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still \n               in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.\n\n               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN\n\n               Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's \n               house.\n\n               The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.\n\n               There's the sound of a phone being dialled.\n\n                                     CARTER (V.O.)\n                         Police.\n\n               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n\n               A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, \n               followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and \n               around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around \n               the building. A chief constable opens the front door and \n               walks in.\n\n               INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n\n               The police move through the house and grounds. In the \n               bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The \n               men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about \n               being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, \n               pornography and so on.\n\n               Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass \n               leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They \n               follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, \n               face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes \n               in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we \n               see that it's Margaret.\n\n               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n\n               The house is surrounded by police measuring and \n               photographing, and outside the house are police cars and \n               ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In \n               the early-morning light, they look like dolls.\n\n               Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes \n               officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes \n               down the short drive to the gate.\n\n               INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN\n\n               Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide \n               beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his \n               left.\n\n               The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a \n               harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast \n               wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal \n               loader for tankers.\n\n               This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and \n               pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top \n               tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal \n               chutes.\n\n               EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN\n\n               Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle \n               of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to \n               the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man \n               is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. \n               He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. \n               Carter follows.\n\n               At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only \n               the harbour waters lapping below.\n\n               Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see \n               Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the \n               roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly \n               above him.\n\n               Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's \n               playing cat and mouse with Eric.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (calling out)\n                         You couldn't win an egg and spoon \n                         race, Eric.\n\n                                     ERIC\n                              (wheezing)\n                         Sod off.\n\n               Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and \n               makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. \n               Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the \n               gun up. Eric stops and looks up.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Stay away from the car or I'll \n                         blow you apart.  \n\n               Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. \n               He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards \n               the beach. Carter starts after him.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n\n               Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his \n               feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.\n\n               In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter \n               appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at \n               the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and \n               starts running.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n\n               Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and \n               panics. He stumbles and falls over.\n\n               He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the \n               headland. Carter follows.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n\n               On the other side of the headland, the scene is \n               extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the \n               world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's \n               littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep \n               in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the \n               left. It's deserted.\n\n               In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets \n               move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit \n               their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal \n               mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The \n               sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.  \n\n               Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. \n               Carter closes on him.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n\n               Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the \n               mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and \n               crash as they move along the cable.\n\n               Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal \n               slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on \n               his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically \n               at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too \n               exhausted to get up.\n\n               Carter stands over him.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                              (panting slightly)\n                         Stand up, Eric. Stand up.\n\n               Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch \n               out of his pocket.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         I bet you could use a drink, could \n                         you, Eric?  \n\n               He throws the bottle to Eric.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Eh? Have a drink.\n\n                                     ERIC\n                         Still got your sense of humour.\n\n               Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a \n               terrible state.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want \n                         you to drink all of that. Do you \n                         understand? Drink up. Just like it \n                         was with my brother, Frank. Go on, \n                         son. Drink up.\n\n               Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and \n               runs down his face.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Drink up, Eric.\n\n               Eric begins to stagger about.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         It was you who poured it down him. \n                         Eh, Eric?  \n\n               Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No \n               mercy there.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Did you all have a good laugh, eh? \n                         Did you have a good laugh when he \n                         was spewing it up? The whisky is \n                         pouring all over Eric's face and \n                         suit.\n\n               It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing \n               comes up.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Drink it! Drink it! Did you all \n                         pass the bottle round after the \n                         car went over the top?  \n\n               Eric is choking.\n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Don't stop, Eric.\n\n               Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle \n               up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the \n               shotgun.  Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough. \n\n                                     CARTER\n                         Goodbye, Eric.\n\n               Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on \n               Eric's head.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n\n               Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on \n               it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun \n               riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as \n               it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final \n               journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic \n               catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal \n               slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over \n               and everything is gone.\n\n               Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the \n               beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get \n               rid of it.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises \n               the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle \n               and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around \n               the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a \n               large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It \n               is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his \n               death. \n\n               The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a \n               quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A \n               small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. \n               He's dead.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully \n               wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and \n               is soon lost as he drops out of sight.\n\n                                                               FADE OUT:\n\n               THE END \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Carter\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Mike Hodges\u00a0\u00a0Ted Lewis\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:48.319093"}
