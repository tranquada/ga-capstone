One \n               pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the \n               opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some \n               anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual \n               orgy. \n\n               GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa.

Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting \n               turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged \n               leg. Anna shudders momentarily.

A moment later, the door opens. \n               Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in \n               a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs \n               the stairs.\n\n<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT \n</b>\n               Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling \n               wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits \n               an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.\n\n<b>               INT.

Carter hears a \n               vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the \n               ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking \n               up. They see him and quickly drive off.\n\n               Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's \n               an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories \n               flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of \n               cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He \n               leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.\n\n<b>               INT.

He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his \n               skin made-up, like porcelain.\n\n               Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his \n               brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. \n               He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. \n\n               Darkness returns.\n\n<b>               INT.

The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, \n               with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, \n               porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang \n               over everything.\n\n               There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and \n               the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports \n               cars.\n\n               Carter parks and gets out.\n\n               Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily \n               pond.  There, he promptly throws up.\n\n               Carter watches from behind a tree.\n\n               His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the \n               drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.\n\n               CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably \n               dressed in tuxedo and white scarf.

She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, \n               eventually rolling off the bed.\n\n               The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar \n               comes in.\n\n               Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.\n\n               Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.  \n               Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the \n               two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his \n               prize Doreen.  Carter watches.\n\n               Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in \n               the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off \n               his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. \n               Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old \n               and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that \n               drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.\n\n<b>               INT.

He stands, picks her up and walks \n               into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The \n               party is still going on.\n\n<b>                                     KINNEAR\n</b>                         I want you to listen very carefully. \n                         Jack Carter,\n                              (pause)\n                         You know what he looks like?\n\n<b>               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the \n               phone.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         Yes.\n\n               He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle \n               finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He \n               listens until the line goes dead.\n\n               The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and \n               switches off the light. Darkness.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n</b>\n               Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still \n               in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.\n\n<b>               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN\n</b>\n               Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's \n               house.\n\n               The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.\n\n               There's the sound of a phone being dialled.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER (V.O.)\n</b>                         Police.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n</b>\n               A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, \n               followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and \n               around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around \n               the building. A chief constable opens the front door and \n               walks in.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n</b>\n               The police move through the house and grounds. In the \n               bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The \n               men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about \n               being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, \n               pornography and so on.\n\n               Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass \n               leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They \n               follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, \n               face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes \n               in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we \n               see that it's Margaret.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN\n</b>\n               The house is surrounded by police measuring and \n               photographing, and outside the house are police cars and \n               ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In \n               the early-morning light, they look like dolls.\n\n               Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes \n               officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes \n               down the short drive to the gate.\n\n<b>               INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN\n</b>\n               Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide \n               beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his \n               left.\n\n               The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a \n               harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast \n               wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal \n               loader for tankers.\n\n               This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and \n               pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top \n               tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal \n               chutes.\n\n<b>               EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN\n</b>\n               Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle \n               of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to \n               the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man \n               is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. \n               He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. \n               Carter follows.\n\n               At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only \n               the harbour waters lapping below.\n\n               Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see \n               Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the \n               roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly \n               above him.\n\n               Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's \n               playing cat and mouse with Eric.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                              (calling out)\n                         You couldn't win an egg and spoon \n                         race, Eric.\n\n<b>                                     ERIC\n</b>                              (wheezing)\n                         Sod off.\n\n               Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and \n               makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. \n               Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the \n               gun up. Eric stops and looks up.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Stay away from the car or I'll \n                         blow you apart.  \n\n               Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. \n               He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards \n               the beach. Carter starts after him.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n</b>\n               Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his \n               feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.\n\n               In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter \n               appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at \n               the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and \n               starts running.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n</b>\n               Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and \n               panics. He stumbles and falls over.\n\n               He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the \n               headland. Carter follows.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n</b>\n               On the other side of the headland, the scene is \n               extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the \n               world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's \n               littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep \n               in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the \n               left. It's deserted.\n\n               In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets \n               move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit \n               their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal \n               mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The \n               sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.  \n\n               Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. \n               Carter closes on him.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n</b>\n               Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the \n               mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and \n               crash as they move along the cable.\n\n               Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal \n               slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on \n               his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically \n               at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too \n               exhausted to get up.\n\n               Carter stands over him.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                              (panting slightly)\n                         Stand up, Eric. Stand up.\n\n               Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch \n               out of his pocket.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         I bet you could use a drink, could \n                         you, Eric?  \n\n               He throws the bottle to Eric.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Eh? Have a drink.\n\n<b>                                     ERIC\n</b>                         Still got your sense of humour.\n\n               Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a \n               terrible state.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want \n                         you to drink all of that. Do you \n                         understand? Drink up. Just like it \n                         was with my brother, Frank. Go on, \n                         son. Drink up.\n\n               Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and \n               runs down his face.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Drink up, Eric.\n\n               Eric begins to stagger about.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         It was you who poured it down him. \n                         Eh, Eric?  \n\n               Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No \n               mercy there.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Did you all have a good laugh, eh? \n                         Did you have a good laugh when he \n                         was spewing it up? The whisky is \n                         pouring all over Eric's face and \n                         suit.\n\n               It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing \n               comes up.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Drink it! Drink it! Did you all \n                         pass the bottle round after the \n                         car went over the top?  \n\n               Eric is choking.\n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Don't stop, Eric.\n\n               Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle \n               up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the \n               shotgun.  Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough. \n\n<b>                                     CARTER\n</b>                         Goodbye, Eric.\n\n               Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on \n               Eric's head.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY\n</b>\n               Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on \n               it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun \n               riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as \n               it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final \n               journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic \n               catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal \n               slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over \n               and everything is gone.\n\n               Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the \n               beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get \n               rid of it.\n\n<b>               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n               Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises \n               the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle \n               and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around \n               the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a \n               large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It \n               is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his \n               death. \n\n               The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a \n               quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n               Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A \n               small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. \n               He's dead.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He walks off and \n               is soon lost as he drops out of sight.\n\n<b>                                                               FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>               THE END \n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Get-Carter.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Get Carter</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Mike Hodges\" title=\"Scripts by Mike Hodges\">Mike Hodges</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ted Lewis\" title=\"Scripts by Ted Lewis\">Ted Lewis</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Get Carter Script.html#comments\" title=\"Get Carter comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:08.744108"}
