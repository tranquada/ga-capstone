They ought to look\n     cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly\n     sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut\n     hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene --\n\n                                1996\n\n     -- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR\n     YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him.\n\n     It's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS,\n     he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.

The boys,\n     EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying\n     automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall\n     grass.\n\n     Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, \n     sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks.\n\n     The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY\n     FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED\n     CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear.\n\n     The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY, a muscular redhead.\n     TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene...\n\n                                 2010\n\n     Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear, charging.\n\n     BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  First TARGET down!\n\n     RILEY, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two \n     MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET.

The architecture, even in ruins, recalls old\n     Europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after)\n     automobiles.\n\n     Bursts of AUTOMATIC FIRE, occasional MORTAR BLASTS.

Rain POUNDS on a window that\n     looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the\n     Third Dresden Moon.\n\n     TODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  His new rank has been\n     tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and\n     another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of\n     various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an\n     official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into\n     space.

WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE...\n\n     The WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the\n     barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch\n     the rain beat on the windowpane.

COMMAND QUARTERS\n\n     Entering, the MAN shakes rain off his poncho.  His name is\n     RUBRICK, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  He faces the two bored\n     OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated\n     equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops\n     are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups.\n\n     The captain, CHURCH, has his feet on the desk.  He's fifty years\n     old, gray and fat and soft.  The other officer, SLOAN, also a\n     lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately\n     attractive, but not particularly happy.\n\n                                   RUBRICK\n                    Colonel Mekum has his \"boys\"\n                    unpacked.

He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and\n     so does the one next to him, and the next one.  Twenty of them\n     are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was\n     once a station of some sort.  They don't seem to respond to the\n     chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights\n     leaking sixty feet above them.\n\n     Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking\n     the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright-\n     eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by,\n     glowing with satisfaction.\n\n     The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of\n     stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty\n     earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole\n     arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and\n     a sense of emptiness to it.\n\n     SLOAN walks close to the line of NEW SOLDIERS and studies one,\n     her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.

His brow\n     is knit, something's bothering him.\n\n     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS\n\n     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a \"platform\" on the chain, sixty\n     feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.\n\n     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a\n     \"platform\" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.\n\n     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up,\n     three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches,\n     neither man reveals anything at all...\n\n     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP\n\n     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.\n\n                                   CHURCH\n                    What about...spirit?\n\n                                   MEKUM\n                         (as in \"what's that?\")\n                    Spirit?\n                         (...a grin)\n                    Oh!

Send two\n                    more of your old ones up.\n\n     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.

They're still facing each other\n     across the sixty foot drop.\n\n     MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.\n\n     ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. \n     They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.\n\n     Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight\n     motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the \n     veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.\n\n     TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.\n\n     ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW\n\n     For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling\n     around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.\n                                   RUBRICK\n                    Get him, men!\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he\n     starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his\n     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,\n     slides...\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!\n     MELTON hits him again, hard.\n\n     GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with\n     his free hand and with both feet.\n\n     MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the\n     face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes \n     mercilessly.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold\n     on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks\n     up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly\n     hurl ROMERO downward.\n\n     ROMERO rockets down past TODD...\n\n     ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the \n     cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them\n     with blood.\n\n     Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up\n     again...\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's\n     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!\n     GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, \n     swings after him.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.\n     His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and\n     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.\n\n     Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him\n     hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a \"platform\" foothold on his\n     chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down\n     on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,\n     then...\n\n     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one\n     arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free\n     hand and strangling him with the other arm.\n\n     MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.\n\n     ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of\n     concern wrinkles his brow.\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.\n     MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps\n     for air, but...\n\n     GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...\n\n     MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips\n     him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward\n     even as...\n\n     TODD goes for face with his free hand.\n\n     SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.\n\n     TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.\n\n     ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of\n     MELTON's injury.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank\n     impassive faces, RILEY among them.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's\n     elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of\n     him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.\n\n     MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites \n     furiously, drawing blood.\n\n     TODD grits his teeth in pain.\n\n     WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.\n\n     TODD is losing his grip.\n\n     RILEY watches below, his face a mask.\n\n     MELTON bites and elbows furiously.\n\n     TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins\n     to fall and then...\n\n     Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it\n     ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand\n     for twenty feet until...\n\n     He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet\n     to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of\n     ROMERO's broken body below.\n\n     Sudden silence!\n\n     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies\n     motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.\n\n     ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.\n\n     It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one-\n     eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...\n                                   MEKUM\n                    GET DOWN HERE!

FURNACES/FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     A rage of flame!  The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow\n     fury, eight feet high.\n\n     Two men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear,\n     laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  With\n     effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly \n     consumed.  Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another\n     load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the \n     shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  It's \n     overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom.\n\n     The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object.\n\n     It's ROMERO's dead body.  They haul it out of the bin and let it\n     flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at\n     nothing.\n\n     The BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through\n     their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward\n     the flames.\n\n     INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY\n\n     In the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two\n     tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse.  But not\n     quite motionless!  A hand opens and closes!  A bloody hand!\n     Fingers twitch.\n\n     INT.  FURNACE ROOM\n\n     ROARING FLAMES as ROMERO's body is tossed unceremoniously into the\n     fire where the flames begin to consume it.\n\n     For half a second the BURNERS watch ROMERO melt into fire, then\n     they turn their backs and head back for another load.\n\n     INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM\n\n     BURNERS' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, GOINES,\n     dragging the body right over TODD's body.\n\n     As GOINES' shoe drags over TODD's face, TODD's eyes flicker\n     stupidly.\n\n     Then GOINES' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin.\n\n     TODD blinks, fighting for consciousness.  Where is he?  He moves\n     his head...\n\n     INT.

Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur \n     their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape,\n     apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that\n     stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like \"roads\"\n     through the wind.\n\n     TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the \"road.\"  He's \n     trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles\n     through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape.\n\n     TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he\n     locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle\n     back toward the others, dragging his burden after him.\n\n     TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging\n     process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

The cable is twenty yards away in a \"canyon\" of\n     junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed\n     to the wind in order to get to it.\n\n     He starts out from behind the transformer...\n\n     WHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet,\n     his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, \n     struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights\n     the wind, struggles toward the cable.\n\n     Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time\n     as it whistles close to his head.\n\n     TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl \"under the wind,\"\n     toward the taut cable, and we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.  \"STEEL HENGE\" - DUSK - LATER\n\n     Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing\n     in the distance and the dusk.\n\n     Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren \n     landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel\n     thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him,\n     vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must\n     have crashed long ago.\n\n     The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long\n     way, it's almost dark, he's weak.\n\n     He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort.\n\n     He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire.\n\n     He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right.\n\n     Steel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery.\n\n     Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto\n     the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and\n     makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze.\n\n     Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire\n     and get weakly to his feet.

Whatever is making\n     the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only\n     inches above the ground.\n\n     TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange\n     window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well\n     as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind.\n\n     TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten\n     yards to the window and pears through it.\n\n     TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen\n     through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of\n     activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT\n     SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the\n     wind.\n\n     (What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight\n     between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. \n     Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking\n     each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a \n     dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.)\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the \"roof,\" mystified.  He's never seen \n     anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his \n     puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the\n     wind.\n\n     The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first \n     arrived has diminished to a strong breeze.\n\n     TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He\n     looks around.\n\n     The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled\n     by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on\n     the other window/skylight that glows from this strange \"roof\" and\n     on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze...\n     a MUSICAL sound.\n\n     Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next\n     window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music \n     played on an accordion.\n\n     TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window.\n\n     TODD'S POV through the second \"window,\" another mysterious\n     vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is\n     just as puzzled.\n\n     What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an \n     OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor,\n     moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In\n     the corner, another person is making a strange movement that\n     seems to initiate the music...\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has\n     given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC\n     is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the\n     warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the\n     pillow fights.\n\n     Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way\n     past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he \n     freezes...listening!\n\n     A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere...\n\n     TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows.\n     There's nothing visible...\n\n     The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music\n     ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything.\n\n     Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late...\n\n     ROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more\n     powerful than ever!\n\n     TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind,\n     struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to\n     the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed \n     violently, somersaulted helplessly...\n\n     EXT.

For a long\n     moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons\n     that aren't clear.\n\n     Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.\n\n     In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of\n     a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him\n     from the wind howling overhead.\n\n     TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he\n     slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and \n     injured even to crawl.\n\n     Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly\n     sees something.\n\n     Shoes!  Less than a foot from his bloody face.\n\n     He manages to lift his head a little and look up.\n\n     Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench\n     wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and \n     JOHNNY, eight.\n\n     Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on\n     their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in\n     amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps\n     unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

She is SANDRA, a\n     woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous\n     way.  It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and \n     dignity.  She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face.\n\n     TODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless.\n\n     He sees a window high on one wall.\n\n     He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned\n     material hung here and there for decoration.\n\n     Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls.\n\n     He doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the \n     savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his\n     cheek.

They all want to get a\n     look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat \n     shyly.\n\n     SANDRA is wearing a parka too.  She picks up NATHAN from where\n     he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving\n     him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN.\n\n     NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as\n     ELLEN hugs him and comforts him.\n\n     TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and \n     soothe his fears at being separated from his mother.\n\n     Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate\n     him.\n\n     As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over-\n     the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD.\n\n     Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the \n     bedroom and heads for the door.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Let's go.

The MAN in\n     front of TODD glances back at him occasionally, curious, while\n     MACE and SANDRA walk behind him.\n\n     As they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of\n     the trench.

One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel\n     decapitates the VIPER.\n\n     SANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel \n     clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of\n     his.\n\n     They're on all fours in a garden.  The garden is simply a much\n     wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated.\n     There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing.  Behind\n     them, kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding\n     around more mature plants.\n\n     SANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an\n     offhand glance at the dead VIPER.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    You have to watch out for them.\n                    They probably wouldn't kill someone\n                    your size, not if you were healthy\n                    anyway.

It's very...erotic.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    Even after they made the repairs, it\n                    barely got off the ground, it was an\n                    old converted mining transport, a\n                    piece of junk to start with.  It\n                    just...dropped.  Maybe you saw\n                    what's left of it...out there in the\n                    wind.  A lot of people died.  And we\n                    couldn't make any radio contact...\n                    So we were stuck here.  Nobody was\n                    happy about it.  A few years later,\n                    when the dumpers started coming over\n                    and dropping stuff, people tried to\n                    get their attention with explosions\n                    and fires.  But it didn't work.\n                    They must be unmanned...or they just\n                    don't care.  Maybe they think we're\n                    garbage too!\n\n     TODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the\n     shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    So there really wasn't any choice.\n                    People had to pull together and make\n                    the best of it.  We became a...\n                    community.\n\n     As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts \n     pushing against the material of the shift.  She continues, still\n     not noticing where his attention is.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    One good thing...nobody bothers us.\n                    Who'd want to fight over a\n                    godforsaken place like this?\n\n     A wry laugh.  She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and\n     catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her\n     breasts.\n\n     For a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    I guess that's what you like!  The\n                    fighting, I mean.  The wars.\n                         (unsure, a question\n                          really)\n                    You must...you're a soldier...\n\n     TODD doesn't answer as we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     INT.  CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY\n\n     The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in\n     the meeting room.\n\n     HAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the\n     CHILDREN ahead.\n\n                                   HAWKINS\n                    You children are supposed to be\n                    doing lessons.\n\n     The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them.\n     She looks at what they're looking at.\n\n     What they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing\n     an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  His muscular body\n     ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks\n     eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of \n     stitches, the puckered patches of burns.\n\n     HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.\n\n     In the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls\n     and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing\n     speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all\n     too obvious.\n\n     Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to\n     the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that \n     preceded the deadly thrust.\n\n     The CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape.\n\n     HAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud\n     to the children.\n\n                                   HAWKINS\n                    Lessons.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

A \n     flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates \n     their shadows.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away.\n\n     Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD \n     begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until\n     he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze\n     of dark trenches.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

Always does.\n\n     EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH\n\n     As MACE continues talking to TODD, he loads the pockets of his\n     heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal.\n\n                                   MACE\n                         (continuing)\n                    That's why we're weighing down.

He pockets the metal obediently.\n\n     Behind them a small crowd of PIONEERS are doing the same:  JIMMY\n     PIG, SLADE, CHESTER, RED, a woman named SALLY and several OTHERS.\n     In addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors\n     and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various\n     parts of their outfits.\n\n     ANGLE ON MACE noticing TODD eyeing the rifle JIMMY PIG is\n     carrying.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Oh, we're not going to shoot\n                    anything.

We\n                    have flares too.  Come on.\n\n     Other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the\n     surface above as MACE urges TODD to follow.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.  \"STEEL HENGE\" - DAY\n\n     It's very still, no wind.  The little group of PIONEERS is moving\n     along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the\n     wrecked spaceship.  They are tiny figures in the vast landscape.\n\n     CLOSER ON TODD AND MACE as they plod along in the line of\n     PIONEERS.  MACE indicates the wreck off to the right.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Sandra said she told you how we\n                    wound up here.

We\n                    go through the trenches sometimes\n                    and get some good stuff.\n\n     As they pass close along the trench,  TODD looks in and observes\n     the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts\n     and assorted junk protruding.\n\n     MACE chuckles at the sight.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    We try to work 'em when they're dry.\n                    It's lousy going in there when\n                    they're flooded.  You can see...\n\n     A sudden SHOUT, \"HEYYUP!  YO!\" distracts them.\n\n     TODD looks forward, sees RED pointing to a chunk of steel a\n     hundred yards off the wire.\n\n     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG, already fastening his safety rope and a\n     second rope to the wire, then heading off toward the piece of\n     steel, trailing the two ropes.\n\n     ANGLE ON MACE, explaining the procedure to TODD.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Whatever looks useful, if we can get\n                    a rope to it, we'll go for it.  But\n                    you can't ever go further than your\n                    safety line because it'll come up on\n                    you with sometimes maybe ten seconds\n                    or even less.\n\n     TODD is watching JIMMY PIG as he approaches the piece of steel\n     and starts to attach his rope to it.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Like right now.  You hear that?\n\n     TODD listens.\n\n     Nothing at first...then a very faint WHISTLING.  The sound he\n     heard that first night when he was on the settlement \"roof.\"\n\n                                   MACE\n                    It's close when you hear that.\n\n     TODD can see JIMMY PIG.  He's attached the rope to the steel and\n     he gives a signal.\n\n     As PIONEERS start to haul on the line, pulling the steel toward\n     them, MACE shouts at JIMMY PIG.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    SHE'S GONNA BLOW, JIMMY.\n\n     JIMMY waves, starts back toward them.\n\n     MACE indicates for TODD to help haul the steel and the two of\n     them are just joining in the effort when...\n\n     WHOOOOOOOOOO!

To no avail!  He's suddenly airborne, his legs still\n     churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of\n     his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air.\n\n     An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind.\n     Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, crouched low on their knees against the\n     wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY\n     PIG'S safety line.  But the wind is too strong...until suddenly\n     TODD is pulling, and TODD'S strength makes the difference...\n     slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward them...and Pioneers exchange\n     amazed glances at TODD'S strength.\n\n     As he pulls, TODD notices what the others don't...\n\n     ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG, ten yards away.\n\n     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as he's hauled safely in to the group of\n     PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him.  CHESTER is\n     laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe\n     and mimic JIMMY'S desperate effort to outrun the force of the\n     wind...\n\n                                   CHESTER\n                         (shouting, guffawing)\n                    JIMMY...RUNNING...CAN'T...HA HA\n                    CAN'T...KEEP UP WITH HIMSELF...\n                    HA HA HA...\n\n     CHESTER breaks off, suddenly sober, staring off, and the others\n     turn to see what he's looking at.  Everybody stops laughing.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve\n     the rifle!!!  The WIND is dropping off some, enough to stand.\n\n     ANGLE ON MACE and the other PIONEERS reacting with alarm at the\n     sight of TODD picking up the rifle.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD as he turns, rifle in hand.\n\n     TODD'S POV of the PIONEERS staring at him, the WIND diminishing \n     further.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD looking toward them.  Nothing shows on his face.\n\n     ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour.  Trouble!  Just what he expected.\n\n     ANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward\n     TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle...\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a\n                    lot...\n\n     But MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is\n     elsewhere.\n\n     TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape.\n\n     MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE \"JUNK MOUNTAINS\" in the distance, several miles off, \n     where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER\n     SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the\n     junk heaps far below.  The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling\n     onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind.\n\n     CLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here.\n\n     ANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest.\n\n                                   MACE\n                    Dumpers.  They come every twenty or\n                    thirty days.\n\n     As TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for\n     the gun.\n\n     TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time.\n     Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE...\n\n     As MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of\n     relief, grinning again as the tension eases.\n\n     TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated.  So \n     that's what they did to him!\n\n     Just then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder.\n\n                                   JIMMY PIG\n                    Thanks, partner.  These no-goods\n                    woulda just let me blow away.\n\n     TODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG\n     like what was that?  Are you hitting me?\n\n     But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial\n     manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an\n     attack.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

He\n     stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him.  What\n     on earth is going on?  What are they doing?\n\n     JIMMY PIG is marching around in a Santa Claus costume, doling out\n     presents to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY and OTHER CHILDREN.\n\n                                   JIMMY PIG\n                    HO HO HO!  HO HO HO!\n\n     Passing TODD, JIMMY PIG acknowledges him with a wink and a\n     special \"HO HO HO.\"\n\n     TODD'S eyes give away his confusion.  What the fuck is this?\n     JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach?  This is the\n     craziest shit TODD has ever encountered.\n\n     ANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand.  He hasn't a clue\n     what it is or what he should do with it.\n\n     Laughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull\n     the wrapping off.  Great idea!  NATHAN likes pulling wrapping\n     off!  That's fun.  SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears\n     at the wrapping enthusiastically.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet.\n\n     ANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a\n     pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk.\n\n     MACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it.  The wings flap as\n     the wheels turn!\n\n     NATHAN reacts with delight and amazement!  Then grabs it!\n\n     A SUDDEN SCREECH...\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed.  He's on his way to the door, but\n     EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!!\n\n     Not sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older\n     woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily.\n\n     As TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a\n     peck on the cheek and points over head.\n\n     TODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it\n     that says \"MISTLETOE.\"\n\n     Means nothing to TODD.  There's a burst of applause as EMMA\n     scrambles off the stool.  Somebody starts to sing \"GOD REST YE\n     MERRY GENTLEMEN.\"\n\n     A MONTAGE OF FACES:  JIMMY \"SANTA\" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED,\n     CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!

The merriment has evolved into\n     a more spiritual mood as the PIONEERS join in the solemn hymn.\n\n     But TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the\n     wings flap.  NATHAN is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and\n     starts to cry.\n\n     Immediately SANDRA disengages from the adults and rushes to the \n     sobbing NATHAN and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and\n     MACE joins her, hovering over his son.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, watching.  After a moment, TODD scrambles off the\n     roof and drops into the adjoining trench while \"OH, HOLY NIGHT\"\n     continues to blend with the soughing WIND.\n\n     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH\n\n     Lit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench, TODD starts \n     doing push-ups.

She approaches the door and looks\n     in.\n\n     ELLEN and other CHILDREN (including NATHAN) are playing\n     children's games on the floor, paying no attention to the source\n     of the strange noises...JOHNNY and WILL.\n\n     JOHNNY and WILL are doing exercises, obviously inspired by TODD's \n     martial calisthenics, and including the sudden violent movements.\n\n     As the two boys make their ritual grunting noises, HAWKlNS frowns\n     a worried frown, and we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.  TRENCH GARDEN - DAY\n\n     The seedlings have grown to twelve-inch stalks.  SANDRA is\n     pulling some from the ground as TODD imitates her.

OTHER ROOM - DAY\n\n     Cleaning vegetables, SANDRA is separating the roots, shaking the\n     dirt off, cutting away the excess.\n\n     TODD is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away\n     with the knife.\n\n     NATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    It seemed like he was never going to\n                    walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's\n                    an expert.\n\n     Whump!  NATHAN falls on his ass.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                         (a laugh)\n                    Well, not quite an expert.\n\n     TODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately.\n\n     Turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his\n     finger.  Blood flows.  He ignores it, continues working...\n\n     But SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut\n     finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand.\n\n     TODD looks startled is she takes his finger.  Then, staunching\n     the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    Sergeant Todd...what's it\n                    like...what's it like being a\n                    soldier?\n\n     What's it like...?  TODD stares at her, trying to process the\n     question.  Seeing his difficulty SANDRA tries to help...\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    What do you think about?\n\n     No answer, a stare.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    Do you think about food?  Or women?\n                    You must think about something.\n\n     TODD gulps.  His blank stare could pass for stupidity.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                    What about feelings then?  You must\n                    have feelings.  You must feel\n                    something.\n\n     TODD wets his lips.  He seems about to answer...and yet it's\n     difficult for him.  He could kill a person easier.\n\n     On the floor NATHAN GOOS happily, oblivious.\n\n                                   TODD\n                         (at last)\n                    Fear.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                         (startled)\n                    Fear!

This is incredibly difficult for him, like \n     physical labor.  He wets his lips and take a breath.\n\n                                   TODD\n                    Fear and...discipline.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                         (growing horror)\n                    Oh, my God.

He can't relax.  He's\n     even trembling.\n\n     NATHAN, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently.\n\n     SANDRA lets go of TODD and steps back, looking at him, her face\n     troubled, as we...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

Obviously, they've killed the two men.\n\n     The GUNNER points to the cable.\n\n     CAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the\n     vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike.\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED ENGINES/TERRAIN\n\n     TODD is crouched over MACE inside an abandoned diesel engine not\n     far from the disintegrated turbine.  He's making a tourniquet to\n     stop the bleeding from the stump of MACE's leg.  MACE looks\n     awful, pale, in shock.  He speaks weakly.\n                                   MACE\n                   Oh, shit, Todd...I'm...dead...\n                   aren't I?

He finishes the\n     tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap\n     in the engine at the CRAWLER.\n\n     TODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable, watches it veer left\n     and start to travel along the cable...straight toward the colony!\n\n     TODD turns and looks into MACE's face.  MACE's eyes are clouded\n     with horror.\n\n                                   MACE\n                   Why?

As the CORPSE is dragged past\n     NATHAN, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the\n     uncomprehending little boy.\n\n     NATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing\n     uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  SANDRA is\n     trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same\n     time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN\n     and children CRY OUT.\n\n     NATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing.

TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet.\n\n     NATHAN recognizes his \"friend,\" tries a tentative little smile.\n     But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from \n     NATHAN's face.  For a long moment they just look each other in\n     the eyes very seriously.\n\n     SANDRA enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood.\n     Not noticing TODD, she rushes to NATHAN, grabs him...\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   Nathan, thank God, there you...\n\n     Suddenly seeing TODD she breaks off, stares at him.\n\n     Squatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, TODD'S eyes meet\n     hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to\n     assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he \n     wanted to avoid her eyes.\n\n     SANDRA wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out\n     what she can hardly bear to ask...\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   Did he find you?\n\n     No answer.

He straps a sheath knife to one ankle,\n     pulls on boots.  Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, \n     covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and\n     the tourniquet on his arm.\n\n     Staring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood\n     form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet.

INSIDE TRENCH\n\n     Stepping into the trench, TODD hears the wind SCREAM overhead.\n     He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and\n     begins to pull himself up into the wind.\n\n     As he climbs, the SCREAMING wind changes pitch radically, and by\n     the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only\n     a breeze.\n\n     Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced\n     by a terrible stillness.\n\n     As TODD looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from\n     the trench behind biz.\n\n                                   SANDRA (O.S.)\n                   Sergeant!  Sergeant Todd!\n\n     TODD turns back, looking down into the trench, and sees SANDRA\n     looking up at him.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   Sergeant...these soldiers...the ones\n                   you're going to fight...  Are these\n                   the \"better ones\"...the ones who\n                   replaced you?\n\n     TODD looks at her for a long moment, his face a mask, before he\n     nods almost imperceptibly.  Her eyes are full of tears.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   Sergeant Todd...I think they...I\n                   think...someone made a serious...\n                   mistake.\n\n     TODD looks into her eyes.  It is impossible to tell if he knows\n     that she cares about him and that she is blessing him.\n\n     After a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness,\n     the CLANKING of his equipment the only sound in the spooky\n     stillness.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.  JUNK/TERRAIN - NIGHT\n\n     Two CRAWLERS cut through the night fifty yards apart.  Four of\n     the NEW SOLDIERS cling to the outside of one CRAWLER, five on the \n     other, two on each CRAWLER operating spotlights that pan the\n     darkness to the sides while the headlights illuminate the\n     skeleton of the crashed ship and shadowy chunks of machinery\n     littered across the terrain ahead of them.\n\n     It is very still.  No wind.\n\n     INT.  CRAWLER ONE\n\n     A DRIVER is at the wheel, a GUNNER beside him, studying the night\n     through an infrared scope.  Behind them, two more NEW SOLDIERS\n     sit lost in shadows in the back seat, staring impassively out the \n     window at the spooky spotlights combing the eerie junkyard.\n\n     EXT.  CRAWLER ONE\n\n     The LEFT FRONT SOLDIER sits on the fender seat of CRAWLER ONE,\n     peering along the beam of his spotlight, scrutinizing the\n     sinister shapes in the darkness, when...\n\n     BLAM!  He's shot in the face, slammed back into the windshield of \n     CRAWLER ONE.\n\n     INT.  CRAWLER ONE\n\n     Vision blocked, the DRIVER is fighting for control of the vehicle\n     as the GUNNER to his right screams into the radio mike...\n\n                                   GUNNER\n                   CRAWLER ONE, WE ARE RED!  RED!  WE\n                   ARE RED!\n\n     By veering sharply, the DRIVER is able to shake off the body that\n     was blocking his vision, clearing his shattered windshield.\n\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     Seven of the NEW SOLDIERS -- the three hanging on CRAWLER ONE and\n     the four from CRAWLER TWO -- drop off into the stillness.  One\n     checks the LEFT FRONT SOLDIER's body while the others, barely\n     visible in the weak light, fan out, keeping low, taking cover in\n     the random junk strewn all around them.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE, a corporal, crouched behind a huge\n     piece of discarded agriculture machinery.  He yanks a flare from\n     his waist band and fires it.\n\n     The FLARE bursts overhead, exposing the ghostly terrain to a\n     bright green light.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE JUNK AND THE SKELETON SHIP: a ghostly graveyard.  No \n     wind.  Nothing moves.  No sign of TODD.\n\n     INT.  CRAWLER ONE\n\n     Maneuvering across the junk-strewn landscape, the DRIVER peers\n     through the cracked windshield at the green terrain, looking for\n     TODD as the RADIO crackles...\n\n                                   RADIO\n                   Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Do you\n                   have a sitrep?\n\n     THE GUNNER and the DRIVER exchange a glance.  The GUNNER takes\n     the mike and speaks into it.\n\n                                   GUNNER\n                   Crawler Two, we are one down,\n                   responding to sniper activity.\n\n     INT.  CRAWLER TWO\n\n     CAINE 607 is at the wheel, speaking into his mike.\n\n                                   CAINE 607\n                   Crawler One, do you require\n                   assistance?\n\n                                   RADIO\n                   That is negative.  We will eliminate\n                   the sniper and rendezvous at target.\n\n                                   CAINE 607\n                   Roger, One.  We are proceeding to\n                   target.\n\n     CAINE 607 accelerates the CRAWLER.\n\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     The flare fades and the near darkness returns.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then \n     signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby.\n\n     As the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions, \n     they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE.  Exchanging hand signals,\n     the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly\n     he \"disappears.\"\n\n     EXT.  INSIDE A \"CATCM TRENCH\"\n\n     SPLASH!  SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench.\n\n     He struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  He pulls\n     a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both \n     directions.\n\n     The flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in\n     water and littered with rusting junk.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way\n     out.\n\n     His light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the \n     trench, a perfect ladder.\n\n     He's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his\n     beam down the trench behind him.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench.  Junk and water.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the\n     ladder.  Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again.\n\n     Again his light illuminates the spooky trench.  Again, nothing\n     but water and junk.\n\n     Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when...\n\n     TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon.\n\n     Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him.\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE\n     stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not?\n\n     NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn\n     and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was.\n\n     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH\n\n     TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his\n     head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging\n     through the soldier's equipment, looking for something.\n\n     He finds it.\n\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly\n     a flare bursts above them.\n\n     The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them\n     in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take\n     cover...\n\n     BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing\n     on the ground, SCREAMING.\n\n     ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, \n     accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS....\n\n     ANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench.\n\n     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH\n\n     Tracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he \n     races down the trench, running for his life.\n\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     Still firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the\n     CRAWLER.\n\n     CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle\n     pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid!\n     The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and\n     diminishes backward like a man pissing...\n\n     INT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH\n\n     TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench,\n     sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench.\n\n     Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries\n     to scale the steep wall of the trench.\n\n     WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts\n     into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something!\n\n     NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls\n     over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them.\n\n     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD.\n     They've got him now!\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD bellying toward a rusting turbine, disappearing\n     from view.\n\n     ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE, separated from TODD'S hideout by the \n     trench, pouring heavy FIRE on the spot where TODD disappeared.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS communicating by hand signals as they move\n     to surround TODD.\n\n     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE\n\n     As rockets and canon shells SLAM into the turbine, TODD hastily\n     attends to a nasty wound in the flesh his thigh, bandaging it\n     skillfully, quickly.\n     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     While CRAWLER ONE keeps TODD pinned down, NEW SOLDIERS move to \n     outflank him.\n\n     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE\n\n     As TODD completes dressing his thigh, the CRAWLER stops firing.\n\n     Silence.\n\n     TODD peers out, assessing the situation.\n\n     TODD'S POV of the terrain.  Vague glimpses of NEW SOLDIERS\n     slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough\n     for a shot.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD.  He seems to know he's in a tight spot.  He's\n     preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades,\n     when...he freezes.  Listens.\n\n     Behind the stillness he can hear the faint WHISTLE that precedes\n     the wind.\n\n     Hastily TODD yanks his belt off.\n\n     EXT.  TERRAIN\n\n     NEW SOLDIER FOUR sticks his head up from behind an old boiler and \n     signals NEW SOLDIER FIVE.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FIVE acknowledging from the mouth of an old \n     storage tank where he's positioned.\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER SIX bellying toward TODD'S position.\n\n     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE\n\n     Using his belt and a carabiner as a safety line, TODD attaches\n     himself to the heavy turbine...and gathers up his weapons.  He\n     can HEAR the very low WHISTLING building ever so slightly.\n\n     EXT.  TERRAIN\n\n     The WIND SIGHS and a faint breeze stirs.  Then a tin can skitters\n     by in a puff of wind as the NEW SOLDIERS take turns moving\n     closer to TODD, flanking him from safe vantage points.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER FOUR stands to wave the next man forward when...\n\n     WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!  THE WIND ERUPTS, ROARS, BELLOWS...\n\n     NEW SOLDIER FOUR is lifted into the air and carried away.\n\n     NEW SOLDIER FIVE is trying to stay on his feet, as the wind SLAMS\n     him into one piece of junk after another.\n\n     INT./EXT.  CRAWLER\n\n     As the wind HOWLS and shakes the CRAWLER, the DRIVER and the\n     GUNNER stare with amazement as NEW SOLDIER FIVE slams into their \n     windshield, neck broken, and stares at them with lifeless eyes.\n     They see NEW SOLDIERS SIX and SEVEN tumble and somersault past.\n\n     As NEW SOLDIER SIX disappears, blown off into the night, NEW\n     SOLDIER SEVEN manages to grab hold of the walking wire.\n\n     Gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be \n     decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the\n     air.\n\n     EXT.  TERRAIN\n\n     NEW SOLDIER FOUR, badly battered, is down on his belly trying to\n     stay \"under the wind\" when he sees something terrible!\n\n     HIS POV of a massive lathe blowing right toward him along the\n     ground, tumbling, crashing, slamming into things.  It looms over\n     him, unavoidable, the end!\n\n     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FOUR reacting to the huge lathe about to\n     crush him.\n\n     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE\n\n     Held by his safety belt and protected by the turbine, TODD peers\n     out, and watches the wind destroy the footsoldiers.\n\n     TODD'S POV OF NEW SOLDIER FIVE's lifeless body being blown along\n     the ground like a leaf.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, reacting.  He's seen something important.\n\n     TODD'S POV of CRAWLER ONE moving again, rounding the far end of\n     the trench and, no longer separated by the trench, turning\n     toward TODD'S position.\n\n     INT.  CRAWLER ONE\n\n     As the DRIVER steers, the GUNNER peers through his scope.\n\n     GUNNER'S INFRARED POV of TODD darting behind an overturned vat.\n\n                                   GUNNER\n                   There!\n\n     The DRIVER steers toward where TODD disappeared.\n\n     EXT.

CRAWLER ONE\n\n     The GUNNER is peering intently through his scope.\n\n     GUNNER'S POV through his scope: The infrared view with crosshairs\n     is especially spooky because of the debris blowing eerily across\n     the landscape as the gun whips back and forth, looking vainly for \n     TODD.  Suddenly the sight is yanked hard, sweeping violently\n     over to pin a moving object...\n\n     False alarm!  Just another piece of blowing junk.  No sign of\n     TODD.\n\n     EXT.  CRAWLER/JUNK TERRAIN\n\n     The CRAWLER grinds slowly past a huge overturned boiler, its\n     cannon panning right, then left, then right.\n\n     INT.

One of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel\n     past in the wind when --\n\n     -- he reacts!\n\n     -- as TODD'S face appears is only inches from his, right against\n     the plexi!\n\n     BAM!  Before the NEW SOLDIER can do more than look startled, TODD \n     shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade\n     through the hole.\n\n                                   NEW SOLDIER\n                   RED!

The grenade EXPLODES and...\n\n     The DRIVER fights for control of the wheel.\n\n     The GUNNER screams and screams and screams like a machine running\n     at high speed while the two NEW SOLDIERS lie open-eyed with death\n     in the back seat.\n\n     EXT.

From the corridor!\n\n     SANDRA freezes.  TODD is alert, tense...and covered with\n     CHILDREN.\n\n     SANDRA turns and runs for the door as TODD starts to put the\n     CHILDREN down.  But he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful\n     self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.\n\n     INT.  CORRIDOR\n\n     Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, \n     weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers\n     after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid \n     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   Sergeant Todd!\n\n     ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps\n     ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.\n\n     INT.  MEETING ROOM\n\n     TODD is just putting NATHAN gently on the floor when he sees\n     CAINE 607 arrive in the doorway.  For halt a second their eyes\n     meet, then --\n\n     CAINE 607 advances on TODD.\n\n     Still encumbered by CHILDREN clutching at him, TODD sees his\n     weapons, but can't get to them.  Then it's too late!\n\n     The terrified CHILDREN watch as the giant CAINE 607 clubs TODD \n     mercilessly with the rifle butt, then hurls him backwards like a\n     rag doll.\n\n     Horrified, SANDRA sees TODD slam into a wall, slump to the floor.\n\n     Dismissing TODD, CAINE 607 turns, looms toward the CHILDREN.\n\n                                   SANDRA\n                   THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN!\n\n     CAINE 607 ignores her, heads for ELLEN, dragging his bad leg.\n\n     Spotting TODD'S weapons, SANDRA snatches a heavy rocket rifle,\n     brings it up awkwardly, points it, FIRES!\n\n     And the kick from the heavy gun sends SANDRA sprawling back, the\n     weapon trembling from her hands.\n\n     But the WHIZZING ROCKET, a near miss, gets CAINE 607's attention.\n     He turns away from ELLEN, toward SANDRA.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD rising to his knees, blinking stupidly, trying to\n     focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead.\n\n     TODD'S POV, a vague, unfocused image of SANDRA, snatching a\n     bayonet from TODD'S gear on the floor and lunging courageously at \n     CAINE 607.\n\n     Vaguely, TODD sees CAINE 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and\n     grab her.  As she beats at CAINE 607 bravely with her fists, the\n     big man slams her into a wall brutally.  As she crumples, he hits\n     her again.\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his\n     head to clear it.\n\n     His eyes go to SANDRA, slumped against the wall, bloody.\n\n     Terrified CHILDREN look up at CAINE 607 as he towers over them. \n     Suddenly...\n\n     SHTUNK!  A knife blade suddenly sticks in CAINE 607's neck.\n\n     CAINE 607 only flinches... and, as he YANKS the knife from his\n     neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade...\n\n     WHAM!  TODD slams into him, tackling him, driving his big\n     shoulder deep into the new soldier's waist, slamming the big man\n     hard into a wall.\n\n     Air goes out of CAINE 607, the knife drops from his hand.\n\n     But that's it for TODD's victory.  Six-five, two-sixty, CAINE 607\n     is bigger and stronger than TODD.  His powerful arms rip TODD off\n     him like he's taking off a Band-Aid.\n\n     Terrified, wide-eyed CHILDREN watch TODD hurled back across the\n     room.\n\n     TODD scrambles to his feet, shakes his head clear.\n\n     Here comes CAINE 607, dragging his bad leg.\n\n     TODD attacks!  Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a\n     vicious kick!\n\n     But 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack!\n\n     TODD lunges again employing yet another skilled move.\n\n     SMACK!  CAINE 607 outmaneuvers TODD again, punishing him\n     brutally.\n\n     WHACK!  WHAM!  SMASH!  CRUNCH!  This time TODD jolts the bigger\n     man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the\n     Adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the\n     jaw.\n\n     This time it's CAINE 607 who has to back away to recover.  And\n     now he seems to re-consider TODD, revealing for the first time a \n     genuine respect.\n\n     As their eyes meet, CAINE 607 seems to be saying \"All right then,\n     you're serious, let's do it, fella.\"\n\n     TODD lunges.\n\n     SMASH!  CAINE 607 creams him.\n\n     TODD twists, slams CAINE 607 back.\n\n     BASH!  A fist to the face!\n\n     UMMMMMPH!  A knee in a groin!\n\n     SLAM!

Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath\n     coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the\n     last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one\n     more time...before he slumps unconscious.\n\n     Horrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with\n     the last of his strength, \"finishing him off.\"  NATHAN can't\n     stand it.\n\n     He toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and\n     attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's\n     bloody face.\n\n     The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual\n     blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet.\n\n     Once standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees.  For\n     a moment he's confused.  What's this?\n\n     Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself.  When\n     he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as \n     dead.  One blow and...\n\n     But just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling\n     him.  As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls\n     on top of the fallen man.\n\n     As CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out\n     of his eyes.  He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never\n     quit.  He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as\n     TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers...\n\n                                   CAINE 607\n                   It hurts!\n\n                                   TODD\n                         (sympathetic)\n                   I know.\n\n     SNAP!

She holds NATHAN's\n     hand toward TODD.\n\n     TODD looks confused.\n\n     There are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little\n     hand into TODD's huge left paw.\n\n     TODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's \n     flooded eyes.\n\n     Does TODD understand her gesture?  His face is impassive.  Maybe\n     he doesn't.

Hurry.\n\n     CHURCH and SLOAN are hunched desperately over the bomb in near\n     darkness, the wind tearing at them.  SLOAN tries to punch a code\n     into the keys...\n\n                                   SLOAN\n                    Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's\n                    six-seven or seven-six...\n\n                                   CHURCH\n                    Try one! Try it!\n\n     SLOAN punches the keyboard blindly.\n\n                                   SLOAN\n                    There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did\n                    it -- ?\n\n     BAHWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Everything is dazzling, blinding light!\n\n     INT.  COCKPIT/\"DADDY\"\n\n     White light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as TODD and \n     RILEY stare at the video monitor where MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE is\n     babbling frantically.\n\n                                   MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE\n                    ...I need a report, Captain.  It's\n                    not just my ass, it's yours too!\n                    You've got to stand by me on this.\n                    I want you to come in right now...\n                    right now!  Do you understand me?\n                    Right now!\n\n     RILEY turns to TODD, looking a question at him.  TODD meets his\n     look and no words are necessary.\n\n     RILEY reaches for the control switch as MEKUM continues babbling.\n\n                                   MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE\n                    This is important for all of us, for\n                    our careers.  There's going to be a\n                    Board of Inquiry and --\n\n     MEKUM'S IMAGE cuts out mid-babble.\n\n                                   SLADE'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                    That was the boss, huh?\n\n     TODD and RILEY turn to see SLADE in the entrance to the cockpit \n     addressing TODD and the VETERANS collectively.\n\n                                   SLADE\n                    Well then, I guess you fellas are\n                    all right.  I guess I misjudged you\n                    some.  Where I said you were \"a\n                    buncha no good killer robots,\" I\n                    mighta just overspoke myself.  As of\n                    now, till it goes otherwise, you got\n                    my sincere approval and support.\n\n     With that, SLADE turns and exits.\n\n     TODD looks at RILEY, RILEY looks at TODD.  What the fuck was\n     that?\n\n     INT.  CORRIDOR/\"DADDY\" - NIGHT\n\n     NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself\n     on a wall, keeps going.\n\n     He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a\n     console like robots.  They don't look up.\n\n     NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.\n\n     INT.  COCKPIT/\"DADDY\"\n\n     Entering, NATHAN moves among the legs of big men, VETERANS.\n     NATHAN keeps going.\n\n     Then, backing against a wall, he looks up and VETERANS loom past\n     him with blank faces.  He is alone again.\n\n     NATHAN totters onward.\n\n     CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve, \n     showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.\n\n     TODD and RILEY are poring over them, their eyes considering dot\n     after dot.  Finally, TODD points to a dot and looks a question at \n     RILEY.\n\n     RILEY considers the dot for a long moment...then he looks TODD in\n     the eye.\n\n                                   RILEY\n                    Cold.\n\n     TODD looks back at the dot, considers it, looks back at RILEY.\n\n                                   TODD\n                    Air?\n\n     RILEY nods a yes.\n\n     TODD is thoughtful...finally asks the next question.\n\n                                   TODD\n                    Safe?\n\n                                   RILEY\n                         (nodding yes)\n                    But very cold.\n\n     TODD considers the dot on the map again, then looks at RILEY.\n\n                                   TODD\n                    That one.\n\n                                   RILEY\n                    Aye, aye, sir.\n\n     RILEY turns toward a console, but something makes him look down\n     toward his feat.  Then he looks back at TODD.\n\n     TODD follows the look.\n\n     Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him.\n\n     TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig\n     still wrapped around his neck.\n\n     NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up.\n\n     TODD considers the outstretched arms.\n\n     RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD.  What's this?\n\n     TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks\n     NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest.\n\n     RILEY looks on.  Never seen anything like it.\n\n     NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a\n     little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response.\n\n     TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face.\n\n     All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a\n     smile, almost comical.\n\n     NATHAN reads the intention successfully.  His face collapses into\n     a huge friendly grin.\n\n     TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince.\n\n     RILEY watches.  Totally amazed.\n\n     TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it.\n\n     NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars,\n     a sky full of hope.\n\n     As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a\n     smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight.\n\n     NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and\n     suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by\n     accident.\n\n     RILEY watches the two of them for a moment, confounded by what\n     he's seeing.  Then he turns to the console and...\n\n                      THE CLOSING CREDITS ROLL.\n\n                               THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoldier\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Webb Peoples\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:01.851485"}
