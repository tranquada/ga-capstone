And only \n                         the most patient and nurturing growers \n                         can do it really, can tap into Pinot's \n                         most fragile, delicate qualities. \n                         Only when someone has taken the time \n                         to truly understand its potential \n                         can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest \n                         expression.

He \n                         had a big, kind of show-off cellar. \n                         But then I found out that I have a \n                         really sharp palate, and the more I \n                         drank, the more I liked what it made \n                         me think about.\n\n<b>                                     MILES\n</b>                         Yeah?

I think about all those \n                         people who tended and picked the \n                         grapes, and if it's an old wine, how \n                         many of them must be dead by now. I \n                         love how wine continues to evolve, \n                         how every time I open a bottle it's \n                         going to taste different than if I \n                         had opened it on any other day. \n                         Because a bottle of wine is actually \n                         alive -- it's constantly evolving \n                         and gaining complexity. That is, \n                         until it peaks -- like your '61 -- \n                         and begins its steady, inevitable \n                         decline. And it tastes so fucking \n                         good.\n\n               Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells \n               us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs \n               another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches \n               out and places one hand atop his.\n\n<b>                                     MILES\n</b>                              (pointing)\n                         Bathroom over there?\n\n<b>                                     MAYA\n</b>                         Yeah.\n\n               Miles gets up and walks out.

I would have \n                         called you sooner, but I think I've \n                         needed some time to think about \n                         everything that happened and what \n                         you wrote to me. Another reason I \n                         didn't call sooner is that I wanted \n                         to finish your book, which I finally \n                         did last night.\n\n               Miles's heart pounds.\n\n<b>                                     MAYA'S VOICE\n</b>                         I think it's really lovely, Miles. \n                         You're so good with words. Who cares \n                         if it's not getting published? There \n                         are so many beautiful and painful \n                         things about it. Did you really go \n                         through all that? It must have been \n                         awfully hard. And the sister character --\n                         Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to \n                         say I was really confused by the \n                         ending. Did the father finally commit \n                         suicide, or what? It's driving me \n                         crazy. And the title.\n\n<b>               INT./EXT.

I would say stop by the \n                         Hitching Post, but to tell you the \n                         truth I'm not sure how much longer \n                         I'm going to be working there.
