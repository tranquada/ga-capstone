MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies \n               sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never \n               turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.\n\n               As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward \n               the TV to turn it off.

You pay too big a \n                         price.

You \n                         know what? I'm going to get you laid \n                         this week. That's going to be my \n                         best man gift to you. I'm not going \n                         to give you a pen knife or a gift \n                         certificate or any of that other \n                         horseshit.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         I'd rather have a knife.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         No. No. You've been officially \n                         depressed for like two years now, \n                         and you were always a negative guy \n                         anyway, even in college. Now it's \n                         worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching \n                         English to fucking eighth-graders \n                         when they should be reading what you \n                         wrote.

We're going to drink \n                         a lot of good wine, play some golf, \n                         eat some great food, enjoy the scenery \n                         and send you off in style.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         And get your bone smooched.\n\n               Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions \n               for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be \n               right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to \n               signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching \n               him.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         What?\n\n               EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY\n\n               In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --\n               makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that \n               those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.\n\n               MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the \n               rhythm of a road trip.\n\n               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY\n\n               The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward \n               Buellton.

One of the best producers \n                         in Santa Barbara county.\n                              (looking out the window)\n                         Look how beautiful this view is. \n                         What a day!\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I thought you hated Chardonnay.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         I like all varietals.

See, the reason this region's \n                         great for Pinot is that the cold air \n                         off the Pacific flows in at night \n                         through these transverse valleys and \n                         cools down the berries. Pinot's a \n                         very thin-skinned grape and doesn't \n                         like heat or humidity.\n\n               Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and \n               articulateness.\n\n               The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long \n               gravel DRIVEWAY.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Hey, Miles.

I just \n                         called to find out about the salmon -- \n                         for our wedding -- to be more \n                         involved, like you said -- and all \n                         you want to do is get into it about \n                         last night and, okay, I'm sorry.

This causes the girls \n               to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!\n\n               DINNER is improvised, but includes:\n\n               -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.\n\n               -- The SALADS.\n\n               -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her \n               finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.\n\n               -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND \n               WINE.\n\n               -- The four of them DRINK.

She's interested \n               and available -- it's too much for him.\n\n               -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, \n               the cutting choppier.\n\n               -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya \n               and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his \n               jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.\n\n               -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm \n               shoots out to stop him -- \"Slow down.\"\n\n               CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble \n               of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much \n               that he spaces out, descending into --\n\n               INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS\n\n               Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, \n               the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded \n               boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over \n               to the dark side.\n\n               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN\n\n               Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in \n               their own little world -- Jack explaining something to \n               Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.\n\n               -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused \n               expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.\n\n               -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.\n\n               -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short \n               but sensual kiss.\n\n               MOMENTS LATER --\n\n               Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. \n               He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person \n               perspectives.\n\n               AT THE BATHROOMS --\n\n               He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked.

Thinking better of it for a \n               moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.\n\n               CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --\n\n               as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely \n               out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone \n               RINGING and a PICKUP.\n\n               THE RECEIVER --\n\n               As Miles presses it desperately to his head.\n\n                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)\n                         Hello?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Victoria.\n\n                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)\n                         Miles?\n\n               Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Victoria!

It's a hard grape to \n                         grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, \n                         temperamental, ripens early. It's \n                         not a survivor like Cabernet that \n                         can grow anywhere and thrive even \n                         when neglected. Pinot needs constant \n                         care and attention and in fact can \n                         only grow in specific little tucked-\n                         away corners of the world. And only \n                         the most patient and nurturing growers \n                         can do it really, can tap into Pinot's \n                         most fragile, delicate qualities. \n                         Only when someone has taken the time \n                         to truly understand its potential \n                         can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest \n                         expression. And when that happens, \n                         its flavors are the most haunting \n                         and brilliant and subtle and thrilling \n                         and ancient on the planet.\n\n               Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         I mean, Cabernets can be powerful \n                         and exalting, but they seem prosaic \n                         to me for some reason. By comparison. \n                         How about you?\n\n                                     MAYA\n                         What about me?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         I don't know.

He \n                         had a big, kind of show-off cellar. \n                         But then I found out that I have a \n                         really sharp palate, and the more I \n                         drank, the more I liked what it made \n                         me think about.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Yeah?

I think about all those \n                         people who tended and picked the \n                         grapes, and if it's an old wine, how \n                         many of them must be dead by now. I \n                         love how wine continues to evolve, \n                         how every time I open a bottle it's \n                         going to taste different than if I \n                         had opened it on any other day. \n                         Because a bottle of wine is actually \n                         alive -- it's constantly evolving \n                         and gaining complexity. That is, \n                         until it peaks -- like your '61 -- \n                         and begins its steady, inevitable \n                         decline. And it tastes so fucking \n                         good.\n\n               Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells \n               us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs \n               another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches \n               out and places one hand atop his.\n\n                                     MILES\n                              (pointing)\n                         Bathroom over there?\n\n                                     MAYA\n                         Yeah.\n\n               Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American \n               Spirit out of her purse.\n\n               INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and \n               the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S \n               BATH TOYS.\n\n               Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, \n               trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and \n               without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. \n               Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         You are such a loser.

STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.\n\n                                     MAYA\n                         I was just getting some water. You \n                         want some water?\n\n               Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. \n               Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and \n               looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is \n               long gone.\n\n               He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels \n               strained and awkward.\n\n               After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.\n\n                                     MAYA\n                         Nice.\n\n               But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading \n               back into the living room.\n\n                                     MAYA (O.S.)\n                         I should probably get going.\n\n               Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.\n\n               INT. SAAB - NIGHT\n\n               Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads \n               him through this very rural road.\n\n               EXT.

Her ear?\n\n               Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans \n               forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is \n               immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long \n               KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes \n               the door in our face.\n\n               The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.\n\n                                           MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --\n\n                                         THURSDAY\n\n               The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a \n               blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES.

It's about the \n                         marketing.\n\n               Miles is at a loss for words.

The RUMBLE grows deafening.\n\n               INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY\n\n               Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds \n               and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting \n               station. He pushes his way to front.\n\n               The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it \n               back, immediately extending his glass for more.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Hit me again.\n\n               The same small amount is poured and downed.

Miles looks \n               around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic \n               to this injustice.\n\n               Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right \n               up to the brim and beyond.\n\n                                     POURER\n                         Sir, what are you doing?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         I told you I need a drink.\n\n                                     POURER\n                         Then buy a bottle and go outside.\n\n               The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.\n\n                                     POURER\n                         Put the glass down.\n\n               In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby \n               steps back.\n\n                                     POURER\n                         You're going to have to leave, sir.\n\n               The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door.

Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto \n               his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.\n\n               The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags \n               him toward the EXIT.

Miles turns to see --\n\n               STEPHANIE\n\n               seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her \n               lap, watching patiently as --\n\n               THE SAAB\n\n               pulls to a stop in a parking space.\n\n               Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches \n               in the backseat for his Sears bag.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (calling out)\n                         Hey, baby.\n\n               Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack \n               reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Look what I got for our favorite \n                         girl.\n\n               Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging \n               the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms \n               with rage.\n\n                                     STEPHANIE\n                         YOU MOTHERFUCKER!\n\n               She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.\n\n               Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands \n               over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he \n               rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed \n               lion.\n\n               Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out \n               of range.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Stephanie! Stop!\n\n                                     STEPHANIE\n                         You fucking bastard! Lying piece of \n                         shit! You're getting married on \n                         Saturday? What was all that shit you \n                         said to me?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I can explain.\n\n                                     STEPHANIE\n                         You said you loved me! You fuck! I \n                         hope you die!\n\n               With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, \n               she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.\n\n                                     STEPHANIE\n                         Fuckface!\n                              (to Miles)\n                         You too!\n\n               As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded \n               friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.\n\n               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY\n\n               Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses \n               a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Aren't you glad you didn't move up \n                         here and marry her?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Don't need a lecture. You fucking \n                         told Maya, didn't you?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         No, I did not. Must have been Gary \n                         at the Hitching Post. I think we \n                         mentioned it to him the first night.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You told him. I'm fucking hurting \n                         here.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Keep it elevated.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ER WAITING ROOM - DAY\n\n               CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled \"24 Ways \n               To Please Your Man.\"\n\n               WIDER --\n\n               Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a \n               garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a \n               wheelchair faces the wall.\n\n               LATER --\n\n               Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off \n               the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.\n\n                                     MAYA (ON THE PHONE)\n                         Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if \n                         you even care, but I had to call and \n                         tell you again how much I enjoyed \n                         our time together and how sorry I am \n                         things turned out the way they did. \n                         I think you're great, Maya -- always \n                         have. From the first time you waited \n                         on me.\n                              (bracing himself)\n                         And while I'm at it, I guess you \n                         should know that my book is not \n                         getting published. I thought this \n                         one had a chance, but I was wrong. \n                         Again. Don't bother reading it -- \n                         you've got better things to do. So \n                         you see I'm not much of a writer. \n                         I'm not anything really. The only \n                         real talent I seem to have is for \n                         disappointing people and now you \n                         know that firsthand. We're leaving \n                         in the morning, and I want you to \n                         know that I take with me wonderful \n                         memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really \n                         sorry.\n\n               What else to say? He hangs up.\n\n               He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs \n               to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.\n\n               LATER --\n\n               Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency \n               room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE \n               BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with \n               him toward the exit.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Well?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I'm going to need an operation. Maybe \n                         a couple of them. They have to wait \n                         for it it to heal first. Then they \n                         break it again.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Good thing you have a voice-over \n                         career.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue \n                         her ass. Only reason I won't is to \n                         protect Christine.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         That's thoughtful.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (disgusted)\n                         Yeah.\n\n               They walk by us and out the door.\n\n               EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY\n\n               Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost \n               fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes, \n               he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An \n               ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. \n               He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see \n               a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed \n               in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack \n               takes a slug of wine.\n\n               Just then Miles gets back in the car.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I hate this place.\n\n               Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. \n               A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Take a couple of these, and you'll \n                         learn to love it.\n\n               Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Two for you. And two for me.\n\n               Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, \n               who follows suit.\n\n               EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING\n\n               Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first \n               time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         So how did Stephanie know it was \n                         Saturday? We didn't get into that \n                         with Gary.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Huh. Let me think.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You sure you didn't say anything to \n                         Maya?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Sure I'm sure. And just what are you \n                         implying? I'm really pissed off at \n                         you about all this, if you want to \n                         know the truth. What's Maya going to \n                         think of me now just for associating \n                         with you? You're the one who's \n                         sabotaging me, not the other way \n                         around, pal. Not by a longshot.\n\n               Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I don't know. Just seems fishy.\n\n               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV. \n               Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a \n               large dog who has just been neutered.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         What's it look like to you?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Looks like you were in a bad car \n                         accident.\n\n               Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks \n               back in the mirror.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I'm hungry.\n\n               EXT. A.J.

Jack points back at --\n\n               MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly \n               MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --\n\n               JACK --\n\n               weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants \n               to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the \n               door too.

As he sets the bottle back down, we \n               glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.\n\n               He takes another sip.

I'm \n                         going to graduate soon so I'll \n                         probably relocate. We'll see.\n\n               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back \n               door.\n\n                                     MAYA'S VOICE\n                         Anyway, like I said, I really loved \n                         your novel. Don't give up, Miles. \n                         Keep writing. You're really good. \n                         Hope you're well. Bye.\n\n               Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nSideways\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Rex Pickett\u00a0\u00a0Alexander Payne\u00a0\u00a0Jim Taylor\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:35:38.795525"}
