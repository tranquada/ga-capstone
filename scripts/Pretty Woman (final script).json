She slips it down, and because the top is attached to\r\n          the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing\r\n          only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the\r\n          skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated\r\n          Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems\r\n          surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the\r\n          floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from\r\n          the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the\r\n          grapes, but the sound shuts off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back\r\n          on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his\r\n          necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems\r\n          surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig.\r\n          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are\r\n          now dancing on the grapes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off.
