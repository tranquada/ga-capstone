DESERT - DAY\n\n        All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange\n        sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in\n        \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\n        SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.\n\n        PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...\n        the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and\n        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,\n        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.\n        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in\n        the process.\n\n        SLOW DISOLVE\n\n        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.\n\n        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre\n        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.\n        DISSOLVE.\n\n        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some\n        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-\n        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks\n        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion\n        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...\n\n        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the\n        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is\n        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,\n        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are\n        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES\n        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.\n\n        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.\n        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)\n        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.\n\n        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be\n        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a\n        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of\n        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...\n\n\n2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW \"SPHINX\" - DAY\n\n        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH\n        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,\n        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,\n        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS\n        over a portion of it.\n\n        The surface of the tunnel's \"walls\" is curious;  the walls\n        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two\n        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material\n        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.\n\n        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-\n        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.\n        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,\n        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a\n        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.\n\n        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT\n        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.\n\n        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING\n        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to\n        SAFETY.\n\n        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;\n        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --\n        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED\n        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out\n        of molten lava.\n\n        SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE:\n\n                                TOTAL RECALL\n\n        HOLD.\n\n                                                      DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING\n\n        DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed.\n\n        Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and\n        begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.\n\n                                 CLOCK\n                           (sweetly)\n                   Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time\n                   to rise and open your eyes.\n\n        They don't budge.  Shortly, the clock CHIMES again.\n\n                                 CLOCK\n                           (continuing)\n                   Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time\n                   to get up, the day had begun.\n\n        Quail's wife stirs.  Maddeningly, the clock CHIMES a third\n        time.\n\n                                 CLOCK\n                           (continuing)\n                   Tick, tock --\n\n        Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up\n        in bed.\n\n        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the\n        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in\n        thought.\n\n        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early\n        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is\n        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.\n\n        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing\n        for her slippers.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   I dreamed about Mars again... it\n                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (casual)\n                   It's your time of the month again.\n\n        Quail looks at her quizzically.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (continuing;\n                            world-weary air)\n                   At least once a month.  Douglas\n                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve\n                   years you've been talking about\n                   Mars.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   People do go to Mars, you know.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                   That's right, Douglas.  But not\n                   you.  Not us.\n\n        Quail looks crestfallen.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (continuing;\n                            disdainful)\n                   As it is, we can barely scrape by\n                   on your lousy ten thousand a week.\n\n        She leaves the room.  He meditates on what she said,\n        depressed.\n\n\n4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING\n\n        Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.\n        On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.\n\n        Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air\n        of a man who had his \"node stuck in a newspaper,\" ignoring\n        his wife.\n\n        The newspaper headline reads:  \"RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER\n        TAX.\"\n\n        His wife is reading a different article:  \"Four Women Rape\n        Man in Park.\"\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (mumbling)\n                   What do they expect ... the\n                   way men dress these days ...\n                   then they scream rape.\n\n        Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   You know -- let's really do it.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                   Rape men in the park?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   No.  Go to Mars.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (withering)\n                   Go to hell.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   We can pool our savings and\n                   I've got some sick leave\n                   coming, besides my regular\n                   vacation...\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (interrupting;\n                            corrects herself)\n                   ...more of a half-wit.  For\n                   a start a war could break out\n                   there any day ...\n\n        She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police\n        are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs\n        reading \"A FREE MARS\", \"DOWN WITH COHAAGEN\", \"EARTH - OUT\"\n        etc.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   That's just media talk.  They're...\n                           (indicating\n                            the protesters)\n                   ...just a minority.  They're\n                   powerless.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                   Well, there's a lot of things\n                   we need around here before\n                   we waste our money on a trip\n                   to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm\n                   just a slave around this dump.\n                   Now if you were capable of\n                   finding a better job....\n\n        The kitchen clock chimes and talks.\n\n                                 CLOCK\n                   It's now eight.  You'll be\n                   late!\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   I'll be late!\n\n        He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and\n        briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek\n        and leaves.\n\n\n4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING\n\n        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern\n        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)\n        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a\n        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and\n        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on\n        briskly.\n\n\n5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING\n\n        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a\n        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.\n\n        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass\n        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body\n        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly\n        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.\n\n                                 GUARD\n                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   I keep forgetting, Herb.  They\n                   frighten me.\n\n                                 GUARD\n                   Yeah?  Well, it's the law,\n                   Mr. Quail.  Has been since\n                   1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -\n                   ya carry ya gun or ya get\n                   reported.\n\n        GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been\n        through this with Quail before.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Okay.  Herb, okay.\n\n        Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.\n        Signs above each approaching car say \"CAR FULL\", \"ROOM\n        FOR 10 PERSONS\", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked\n        \"NEW CAR\".\n\n\n6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY\n\n        The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a\n        seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS\n        on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.\n\n                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)\n                   -- more violence today from Mars's\n                   strike-torn ore colonies --\n\n        Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks\n        instantly at the word \"Mars.\"\n\n        The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.\n\n                                 NEWSCASTER\n                           (continuing)\n                   ...but Earth Intelligence Operations\n                   Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly\n                   worried about the damage to Mars's\n                   all important tourist\n                   industry was today dismissive\n                   of the dissident groups....\n\n        TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-\n        rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with\n        news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a\n        striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                  We're dealing with a bunch of\n                  extremists and unrepresentative\n                  lunatics.  Mars is a happy and\n                  prosperous protectorate of Earth...\n                  and will remain so.\n\n        The train stops at another station and more people pile on.\n        Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies\n        passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the\n        image.\n\n                                 REPORTER (V.O.)\n                   There have been some criticisms,\n                   sir....\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   I have no further comment.\n\n        The news conference ends and a bright looking young man\n        comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though\n        not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.\n        Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.\n\n                                 ANNOUNCER\n                   Good morning, commuters.  This\n                   portion of your trip is brought\n                   to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you\n                   have a dream that never came\n                   true?  Do you aspire - but\n                   only perspire?  Has the great\n                   adventure passed you by?  Then\n                   come to... REKALL, where what\n                   might have been will have been.\n                   For the memories of a\n                   lifetime... REKALL.\n\n        Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't\n        seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card\n        comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.\n\n\n6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n        Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive\n        of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto\n        the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He\n        then types in a little more information, then pauses again.\n        On the screen, a sentence types itself...\n\n        WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.\n\n        Quail read it and continues.\n\n\n9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY\n\n        Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus-\n        iastic man.\n\n                                 McCLANE\n                   We're all dreamers, Douglas.\n                   But here at Rekall, dreams\n                   are our business.\n\n        He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which\n        they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless\n        stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.\n        Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button\n        again.

In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some\n        instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that\n        apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The\n        room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.\n\n        Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the\n        instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the\n        dentist's, looking at the drills.\n\n        The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE\n        OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.

They settle on\n        McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become\n        cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality\n        seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-\n        edged hardness.

RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY\n\n        A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an\n        inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit\n        door.\n\n        An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible\n        through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then\n        looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view\n        Quail's progress.\n\n\n12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n        Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at\n        the city.\n\n\n12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY\n\n        Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious\n        to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be\n        watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone.\n\n\n12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON\n\n        Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks\n        around, slowly coming to his senses.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Where am I?\n\n                                 DRIVER\n                   Travelling south along Third\n                   Avenue, passing Fourty-third\n                   street.\n\n        Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat\n        in tone) he is filmed from Quail's POV, and it isn't\n        obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Where am I going?\n\n                                 DRIVER\n                   Thirty-three thirteen \"G\"\n                   Street, Sector \"L\", Twin\n                   Towers, Apartment six-thirty-\n                   five.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   How did I get here?\n\n        Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver.

CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n        The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is\n        smart and clean, though not lavish.  A uniformed and armed\n        DOORMAN is standing by the entrance door.\n\n        Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab\n        pull up and Quail alight and enter the building.  He nods\n        to the doorman and approaches the elevators.  As he reaches\n        them a MAN steps out from behind the camera.  A 2ND MAN\n        enters from a door opposite the elevators.  Quail looks\n        at them and becomes quite panicky.\n\n                                 1ST AGENT\n                   Aren't you the man from Mars?\n\n        He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket.  Quail turns,\n        but the other man is behind him.\n\n                                 2ND AGENT\n                   Don't give us a reason to\n                   kill you.\n\n        Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little\n        attention to the events.  As the two men edge Quail towards\n        the door, he call out...\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...\n                   help me... they're...\n\n        But the doorman turns calmly away.\n\n\n16      INT.

They arrive at their car\n        and open the door for Quail.  He hesitates.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   What are you going to do with\n                   me?\n\n                                 1ST AGENT\n                   Get in the car.\n\n        He slaps Quail hard across the face.  Quail is terrified.\n        He is tearful with fear.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   My God!  No!  You're going to\n                   kill me!\n\n        He cringes.  His hands across his face.\n\n                                1ST AGENT\n                   No one's going to kill you if\n                   [you do what you're told.]\n                   We're visiting E.I.O. for some\n                   new tests.

You\n                   can't do it!\n\n        They start to force him into the car physically.\n\n        Suddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM\n        HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   Wait a minute, I remember --\n\n                                1ST AGENT\n                   What, Quail?

And....\n\n        QUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE.\n\n        In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the\n        windpipe, and they crumple to the ground.\n\n        Quail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous;\n        then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they\n        belong to someone else.\n\n        Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he\n        races back into the basement door of his building.\n\n\n18      INT.

It's something they\n                   put into your mind at the\n                   memory place.  Fantasies.\n                   That's their business.\n\n        She sips her drink.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (continuing)\n                   You're a computer operator.\n                   You're a bore.

It's no\n                   fantasy.\n\n        He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting\n        out the lights.\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                   Doug, I want you to see a\n                   doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley\n                   Turnbull have a good man.  He\n                   helped Alec through his\n                   breakdown.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   For fuck's sake, this is no\n                   breakdown!\n\n        Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides\n        into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one\n        lamp, goes to a telephone and dials.\n\n\n19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT\n\n        Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and\n        soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a\n        compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to\n        drain off some of the tension.\n\n        He turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens\n        the bathroom door.\n\n        The instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT\n        comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles\n        and CHARS into a swatch of blackness.\n\n        QUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates\n        the spot where he was standing.\n\n\n20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT\n\n        THE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is\n        the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains\n        drawn over it.\n\n        QUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be\n        HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD\n        of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as\n        someone's breath whooshes out.\n\n        The LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the\n        lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her\n        back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned.\n        He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same\n        time scooping up the pistol.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   My God!

It's true.  You\n                   work for E.I.O.  So do I.\n\n        As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from\n        behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to\n        show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly\n        at the holographic lettering \"Earth Intelligence Organisation\".\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (indicating their\n                            surroundings)\n                   But why all of this?\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                           (shrugging)\n                   We had to watchdog you...make\n                   sure the erasure took.

That\n                   was my idea.  This assignment was\n                   boring me to death.  The\n                   personality they gave you\n                   wasn't too thrilling.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Well, what did I do on Mars\n                   that they have to keep me from\n                   telling?\n\n                                 KIRSTEN\n                   I've no idea.

Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a\n        drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks\n        like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light\n        on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as\n        the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.\n\n\n21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n        Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his\n        paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he\n        heads for the nearest subway entrance.\n\n\n22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\n        Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other\n        subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check.\n\n\n23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\n        An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway\n        entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.\n\n\n24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT\n\n        Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting\n        to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control\n        his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him,\n        pleased to see he has remembered his gun.\n\n\n25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT\n\n        All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway\n        stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to\n        see four large men brandishing guns push their way through\n        the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One\n        gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at\n        them.\n\n        The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer\n        to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men\n        halt abruptly.\n\n                                 FIRST GUNMAN\n                   Fuck it!\n\n        The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver -\n        in his ear.\n\n                                 SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)\n                   We won't be able to track him\n                   again until he comes up above\n                   ground!\n\n\n26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\n        Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the\n        night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is\n        confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video.\n\n                                 TV AS VOICE OVER\n                   Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a\n                   vacation?

Visit\n                   the wonders of....\n\n\n27      EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT\n\n        Quail emerges from underground and looks around.  The\n        streets are almost deserted.\n\n\n28      INT. MOVING OFFICAL VEHICLE - NIGHT\n\n        THE GUNMEN SIT IN THE OV.  The one with the ear plug\n        [suddenly talks.]\n\n                                 EARPLUG WEARER\n                   Coming in again.  Loud and\n                   clear.\n\n        He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the\n        car's dashboard.\n\n\n28A     EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT\n\n        A cab comes into view.  Quail quickly hails it and jumps\n        in.  Cab moves off.\n\n\n28B     INT. CAB - NIGHT\n\n        Quail is still pondering what to do next.  He glances out\n        one window, though not at anything in particular.  Suddenly,\n        the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window\n        on the other side.  Quail ducks to the floor.\n\n\n28C     EXT. CAB - NIGHT\n\n        A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man\n        leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.  He\n        is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at\n        Quail.\n\n\n28D     INT. CAB - NIGHT\n\n        Bullets are still pouring in.\n\n                                 ROBOT DRIVER\n                           (unemotionally)\n                   You are being fired on, sir\n                   or madam, please leave the\n                   cab at once.\n\n        From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls\n        out onto the street.  The pursuing car occupants fail to\n        notice his exit.\n\n\n28E     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\n\n        Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter\n        and moves off down a narrow side street.\n\n\n28F     INT. CAB - NIGHT\n\n                                 ROBOT DRIVER\n                   [Please....]\n\n        Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the\n        head from the body.  The head hits the window then bounces\n        back onto the front seat.  It continues talking.\n\n                                 ROBOT DRIVER\n                           (continuing)\n                   ...leave the cab as bullets\n                   are hitting the vehicle in\n                   considerable quantities.\n\n\n28G     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\n\n        The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display\n        window of a store.  Clothes models are scattered and broken.\n        When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver\n        is lying among the dummies.\n\n                                 ROBOT DRIVER\n                   This company, sir or madam,\n                   will institute legal action\n                   for damages...\n\n\n29      EXT. STREET - \"END OF THE LINE\" HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n        Quail emerges from the side street and sees \"End of the\n        Line\" Hotel.  It is clean, bland, middle class.  He quickly\n        crosses the road and enters.\n\n\n29A     INT. \"END OF THE LINE\" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n        The foyer is brightly lit and empty.  Quail approaches the\n        DESK CLERK, who is reading a book.  \"Dr. No\", marked, in\n        flowing script, \"from the classic series\".\n\n                                 DESK CLERK\n                           (without looking\n                            up)\n                   Help you, sir?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (handing over\n                            money)\n                   A room for the night.\n\n                                 DESK CLERK\n                           (reluctantly\n                            putting down\n                            the book)\n                   ID.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (handing over\n                            money)\n                   Here's ten thousand.

The room is empty.  He hears a noise and looks\n        around.  Two EIO men are standing there aiming lethal-looking\n        high-velocity weapons at him.  One of them is the red-headed\n        man we've already seen.\n\n                                 1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)\n                   Well, look at that.

PAWNSHOP - NIGHT\n\n        Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead,\n        tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance.\n\n        At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room.\n\n                                 PAWNBROKER\n                   You wanta camera?

FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS\n\n        Opening up the small case.\n\n        PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel\n        room he's now in is obviously a different one than the\n        last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down,\n        the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older,\n        etc.\n\n        Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT\n        CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly\n        tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of\n        it red.\n\n\n        CLOSE ON RED MONEY\n\n        On the face of it is printed:  \"MARS FEDERAL COLONY\".\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (mutters)\n                   Martian money....\n\n        Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to\n        himself as he sees how much there is.\n\n        Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE\n        RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of\n        some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver\n        mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS\n        WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read)\n        and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his\n        eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on\n        the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS\n        SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF\n        THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM\n        QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail --\n        down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.\n\n        The image stands and watches Quail.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   What the hell...?\n\n        Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a\n        HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like\n        a television set being turned off.\n\n        Quail looks bemused.\n\n        Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There\n        he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge,\n        a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments\n        and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve.\n\n        He turns on the cassette recorder.\n\n        The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN!\n\n                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)\n                           (Quail's voice)\n                   \"Hauser, this is Hauser -- or\n                   whatever you think your name\n                   is now.

Careful, it's my\n                   neck, too.\n\n        Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly\n        withdraws the wire.  On the end of it is a tiny, metal\n        bead, the Transmitter.\n\n\n37      INT.

He looks\n        around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the\n        skirting board.\n\n        He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the\n        piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside.  He\n        then throws the cheese into the rat hole.\n\n\n38      INT.

The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should\n        go down an alley at the side of a service door.  They\n        advance cautiously, guns at the ready.  They see no one.\n        The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley\n        leading off to one side.  Two of the men sneak cautiously\n        up to it, their guns at the ready.\n\n        A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage\n        bins.  Furious, they fire.  The bullets rip the bins to\n        shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.  The rat is killed.\n        They all stare in disbelief.\n\n                                 EARPLUG WEARER\n                   Ya dirty rat!\n\n\n40      INT. E.I.O. HEADQUARTERS - MEMORY LAB - NIGHT\n\n        OPENING CLOSE on a MONITOR SCREEN slated \"HAUSER/QUAIL\"\n        followed by a serial number and some dates.

SPACE PORT - DAY\n\n        Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In\n        addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there\n        are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They\n        carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that\n        they shine in the face of each passenger going through.\n        (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.)\n\n        The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials,\n        government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group\n        consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly\n        jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They\n        are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is\n        carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... \"MARTIAN TOUR GROUP\".\n\n        The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The\n        chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door\n        begins to close.\n\n                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1\n                   If he had to travel to Mars\n                   with that bunch, I'd be sorry\n                   for him.\n\n                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2\n                   We couldn't have missed him?\n\n                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1\n                   No way.  Let's get a coffee\n                   before the next shuttle.\n\n\n43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT\n\n        One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles\n        her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her\n        handbag, and some clothes on a hanger.\n\n\n44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT\n\n        The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She\n        opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER\n        FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we\n        saw in Quail's emergency kit.\n\n        She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING\n        NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask.\n\n        She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL.\n        He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.\n\n        He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his \"FALSIES.\"\n\n        CLOSE ON MASK\n\n        We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now:\n        \"LASER FACIAL\".\n\n\n45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT\n\n        Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the\n        ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other\n        direction and sees a video theater advertising \"ROCKY 36\"\n        with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited,\n        but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an\n        announcement comes over the intercom.\n\n        A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail\n        looks up.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                   Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll\n                   glance out the starboard\n                   viewports, you'll behold an\n                   indeed awesome sight --\n\n        Quail goes to a viewport and PEERS, transfixed.  He is\n        seeing... at last... the object of his obsession.\n\n\n46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS\n\n        The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before\n        this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly\n        bringing into view -- MARS.\n\n        AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's\n        going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                   Those long gorges you see,\n                   clearly are the legendary\n                   canals of Mars....\n\n        The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.

MARTIAN DESERT - DAY\n\n        An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under\n        a red-orange sky.\n\n        The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the\n        rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the\n        road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere\n        of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the\n        MARSPORT BUS.\n\n        PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL\n\n        A CITY UNDER A DOME.\n\n        In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's\n        midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC\n        STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.\n        Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood\n        rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with\n        a tough town carved out of the wilderness.\n\n\n50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY\n\n        Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR\n        ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him.\n        It is possible he is not a married man.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   It's no Garden of Eden.\n\n                                 TOUR ORGANISER\n                   No.  Quite a bit to see, though.\n                   The canyons, the old Sphinx...\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What do you know about that?\n\n                                 TOUR ORANISER\n                   Not much, really.

CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY\n\n        The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The\n        buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,\n        temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures.\n        The streets are crowded and there is a \"frontier-town\"\n        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water\n        and air containers.\n\n        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and\n        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the\n        dome.\n\n        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around\n        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws\n        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow\n        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....\n\n                                 BOY\n                   Smogpsucker!\n\n        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with\n        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC\n        SONG.\n\n                                 DOORMAN\n                   You know how it is, sir.  Some\n                   of these red-asses are a bit\n                   prejudiced.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Prejudiced?

MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY\n\n        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency\n        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE\n        BOY looks up at Quail.\n\n        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium\n        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the\n        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in\n        spotless linen fill the lobby.\n\n        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on\n        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model\n        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written \"THE FIRST WONDER\n        OF MARS\".

We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified\n        perimeter.\n\n\n59      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.\n        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.\n\n        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.\n        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written\n        in longhand:\n\n                                 \"MELINA NOEL\n                           Last Chance Air Station\n                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9\"\n\n\n60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET\n\n        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly\n        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-\n        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.\n\n        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a\n        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.\n\n        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine\n        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing\n        Quail.\n\n        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is\n        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West\n        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.\n\n                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)\n                   Need a cab, boss mon?\n\n        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                           (continuing)\n                   Mine's right around the corner.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (indicating first\n                            cab in line)\n                   That one's closer.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   But I out-hustle him, right?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (smiling)\n                   Right.\n\n        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the\n        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar\n        car.\n\n\n62      EXT. CITY DOME - AIR LOCK - SUNSET\n\n        An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.\n        Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set\n        off into the desert.\n\n\n63      EXT. DESERT - SUNSET\n\n        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed\n        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.\n        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is\n        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.\n\n\n68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT\n\n        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in\n        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities\n        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:\n        \"LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS\".\n\n        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is\n        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore\n        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,\n        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-\n        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.\n\n\n69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT\n\n        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There\n        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is\n        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-\n        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors\n        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.\n\n        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.  Fragments of\n        conversation are overheard.\n\n                                 MINER #1\n                   ...if that intergalactic little\n                   Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and\n                   clearin' outta here, he can\n                   think again!\n\n                                 MINER #2\n                           (with a laugh)\n                   ...watcha gonna do when he cuts\n                   off the air, Luke?\n\n                                 MINER #3\n                   ...you'll be breathin' red dust\n                   and shittin' bricks.\n\n        Bennie and Quail pass another group.\n\n                                 MINER #4\n                   ...my wife ain't goin' on\n                   one of those space shuttles...\n                   she hates flyin'...\n\n                                 MINER #5\n                   ...aw, come on... flyin's\n                   safer'n crossin' the road...\n\n                                 MINER #6\n                   ...yeah, there ain't been a\n                   real disaster since that\n                   collision off Phobos, nigh on\n                   twenty years ago...\n\n                                 MINER #4\n                           (alarmed)\n                   ...well, that killed twelve\n                   thousand...\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What is this, Bennie...\n                   Tombstone?\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Sorta.

He turns to see\n        an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She\n        doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the\n        crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.\n\n        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into\n        Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   You bastard!\n\n        Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a\n        billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by\n        swinging doors.\n\n        There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail,\n        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns\n        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.\n\n        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the\n                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)\n\n        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front\n        of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection\n        of how well he might have known this woman.\n\n        Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                           (quietly)\n                   You bastard...\n\n        He rubs his painful cheek. \n\n                                 MELINA\n                           (continuing)\n                   That's new -- the innocent\n                   look.\n                           (bitter sarcasm)\n                   You didn't have that one\n                   before.\n                           (beat)\n                   Well?\n\n        Quail is speechless.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Well, uh...

She welcomes this at first, but then\n        pushes him away.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   Whoever I was, I must have\n                   been a helluva guy.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   \"Whoever you were\"???\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Listen.

LAST CHANCE AIR STATION GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n        Quail enters from the cafe.  Bennie is kneeling beside his\n        taxi, repairing a tire.  He look up, sees Quail approach.\n\n        On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device\n        capable of spinning 360 degrees.  He uses it to twirl\n        a lug nut tight on his tire.  As Quail approaches,\n        Bennie removes the TOOL ATTACHMENT from his HAND,\n        tosses it into a kit beside the taxi.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   You don't look so good, boss.\n                   All over the Universe, women\n                   is an awful curse.\n\n        He opens the door for Quail, beams.\n\n\n80      INT. SOLAR-POWERED CAR - NIGHT - MOVING - DESERT BACKGROUND\n\n        Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   It's a tough planet, boss.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Yeah, right.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Some guy really screwed her -\n                   screwed her up real good.\n                   Some Earthman.

CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT\n\n        The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly\n        SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops.\n        He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a\n        huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout\n        CURSES, OBSCENITIES --\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Well... look at that one, eh?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What?\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Big cheese in town.

Somethin' must\n                   be cookin'.\n\n        Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with\n        curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a\n        street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who\n        perhaps faintly remembers him in the past.\n\n\n82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n        Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He\n        checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser,\n        studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard.\n\n        Quail opens a drawer, takes out his \"emergency case,\" sets\n        it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and\n        pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder.\n\n        He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in\n        there were contained the answers to all his questions.\n        He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at\n        the door.\n\n        Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK.\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                           (through door)\n                   Mr. Hauser...\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Who is it?\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                   Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to\n                   you... about Douglas Quail.\n\n        Quail ditches the recorder and the \"emergency case\" into\n        the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL.\n\n        Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side --\n        out of the line of fire).\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (tensely)\n                   Who are you?\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                   My name is George Edgemar.\n                   I work for Rekall, Incorporated.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (stunned;\n                            incredulous)\n                   Rekall??\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                   Yes.

Throw\n                   out your weapon if you want\n                   a past!\n\n        Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his\n        HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                           (whispering)\n                   There's an explosive in the\n                   clipboard!  He has a dead-man\n                   switch in his hand!\n\n        Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds\n        up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND\n        TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN!\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                   What do you say, Hauser?  We\n                   haven't got all night!  Hauser?\n\n        Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What happens it I come out?\n\n        Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to\n        the side of the doorway.\n\n                                 VOICE (O.S.)\n                   We'll put in a word with the\n                   big boys.  Maybe you'll just\n                   get exile to Venus.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   All right.  Here comes the\n                   weapon.\n\n        Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into\n        the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand --\n\n        There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway,\n\n\n83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n        Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor\n        lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled\n        grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor\n        covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling.\n\n        All over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING.\n\n\n84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n        Quail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by\n        the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor.\n\n\n84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n        Two more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while\n        dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction.\n        He pushes open the door leading to the staircase.\n\n\n84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT\n\n        Quail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing\n        is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging\n        carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Back in, quick!\n\n                                 WAITER\n                   Wouldn't you prefer your order\n                   in your room, sir?\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   In!\n\n        Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the\n        elevator.\n\n\n84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT\n\n        Quail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina\n        he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter\n        is too frightened to protest.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Okay.  Answers!

I told them I\n                   didn't care, but then when\n                   I realized they meant it...\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   I don't know why they're\n                   after me, but what's your\n                   connection with all this?\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   We were together before.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Believe me, I'm really sorry\n                   I can't recall the details\n                   of that encounter.\n\n        The elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out.\n\n\n85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT\n\n        Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.\n\n        A solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina\n        leap aboard.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   Go, Bennie, for God's sake!\n\n\n86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT\n\n        Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic,\n        Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                           (glances in\n                            mirror)\n                   Bad news, boss lady.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   What?\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Black cruiser just pull out\n                   behind us.\n\n\n86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\n        A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way\n        through the crowds and traffic behind them.\n\n\n86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n        Quail is aiming his gun at the following car.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Forget the shooter, boss.

He yanks it, like\n        someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting\n        LOUD ENGINE roars to life.\n\n        Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN\n        THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat.\n\n\n87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\n\n        GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at\n        the pursuing car.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (shouts over\n                            GUNFIRE)\n                   You're gonna get a ticket\n                   for that engine, Bennie --\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Yutani 650 -- you like it,\n                   boss?

CITY STREETS - NIGHT\n\n        Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official\n        car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a\n        huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make\n        the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The\n        water container tips and empties water through the open\n        roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)\n        so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the\n        chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic-\n        ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's\n        car.\n\n\n88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n        The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end\n        street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of\n        the windows) in pursuit.\n\n        At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but\n        continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned\n        mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The\n        roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into\n        the narrow opening.\n\n        The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps\n        out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur-\n        veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber\n        their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered\n        in blood and their clothes are in shreds.\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   I take it, then, you've failed\n                   to get him again.\n\n        Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,\n        well-dressed executive type.\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                           (continuing)\n                   Proceed with Operation Sphinx.\n\n                                 EMILE\n                   But, sir...\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   With him...\n                           (gestures toward\n                            the mine)\n                   ...on the lose, I'm not\n                   taking any more chances.\n                   Operation Sphinx will flush\n                   him out.\n\n\n\n93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT\n\n        The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area\n        full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking\n        cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in\n        amazement.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What's all this?\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Nothin', boss.

Quail looks\n        searchingly at Melina and Bennie.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   So you two are into something\n                   a bit more serious than the\n                   taxi and truck-stop business.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   That's right, boss.\n\n        He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with \"MARTIAN\n        LIBERATION FRONT\" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned\n        on it.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   My God!...

A group of people are printing T-shirts\n        and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and\n        Bennie.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   So where did I fit into all\n                   this?\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   You - when you were Charles\n                   Hauser with E.I.O -\n                   infiltrated our group.

CITY - NIGHT\n\n        Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area\n        of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.\n        An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to\n        the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight\n        along the footpaths and streets.\n\n                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER\n                   ...all residents are to\n                   report to their nearest\n                   space-travel agent within\n                   twelve hours, all residents\n                   will be departing on shuttles\n                   within twenty-four hours.  Air\n                   and water supplies will be cut\n                   off at that time.  I repeat...\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   He's doing it!\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What?

It's\n                   been rumored for months...\n\n        The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie\n        ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses\n        her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head.\n        She responds warmly to his kiss.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Wow.

Of course.  That, too.\n\n        They move into the crowd.  The message on the\n        loudspeaker is repeated.\n\n\n101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT\n\n        The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its\n        ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of\n        Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks\n        like something out of \"The Arabian Nights\".\n\n        A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features\n        are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he\n        wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl\n        draped around the back of his neck.\n\n                                 STRANGE MAN\n                           (nodding to\n                            Quail)\n                   Your servant, Fahreem Kuato.\n                   I greet you by the\n                   twenty-seven names that still\n                   remain, praying that you cast\n                   jewels into the darkness and\n                   given them to glow with the\n                   colors of life.\n\n        As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce,\n        to Melina.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   What use is this weirdo?\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   Ssssh...there are skills on\n                   mars that Earth has forgotten.\n\n                                 KUATO\n                   No need to introduce yourself,\n                   Mr. Quail.\n                           (smiles at Quail's\n                            surprise)\n                   Tolerate my presumption, but\n                   it does not tax my powers to\n                   know that you are the most\n                   sought-after man on two\n                   worlds.\n\n        From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information\n        about Quail and Co. can be heard.

We see\n        its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky --\n\n\n103A    PULL BACK\n\n        to reveal the Sphinx is a PROJECTION on a screen in a\n        windowless briefing room.  Quail is seated across from\n        Cohaagen and other SENIOR E.I.O. OFFICERS.  On the walls\n        are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation\n        drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx.\n\n\n107     EXT. MARTIAN SPHINX - SUNSET\n\n        Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;\n        the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.\n\n        Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing\n        breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful\n        excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing\n        an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.\n\n        The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.  Quail\n        ignores them, enters the chamber --\n\n\n107A    CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE\n\n        As he enters.  We read awe, shock and fascination on his\n        features.  He approaches something we can't see.  His\n        hand reaches out.\n\n        Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,\n        striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.\n\n        WHITE LIGHT.\n\n\n105     INT.

BEDROOM - DAY\n\n        Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises,\n        with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make\n        Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss\n        lingeringly;  then Quail, as if \"called to duty,\" exits.\n\n        WHITE LIGHT.\n\n\n108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS\n\n        Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly,\n        the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They\n        grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with\n        amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands\n        he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT-\n        PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS\n        HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind\n        Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the\n        head.\n\n        WHITE LIGHT.\n\n\n109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS\n\n        Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic\n        version of \"the rack,\" his head held imobile by a FEARSOME\n        DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van\n        the two agents tried to shove him into.\n\n        Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves...\n        Cohaagen!\n\n        Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES\n        already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the\n        power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony --\n\n                                 ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE\n                   You have seen your past.\n                   Now read the future...\n\n        WHITE LIGHT.\n\n\n110     INT.

The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as\n        if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground\n        below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail\n\n\n        INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL\n\n        He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully,\n        as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in\n        from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his\n        eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD!\n\n        Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems\n        to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF\n        EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging\n        from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems\n        almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS --\n\n        TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT!\n\n                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:\n\n\n111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT\n\n        Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating\n        like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation\n        seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES:\n\n        KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato --\n        BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                           (rushes to Quail)\n                   Charles!

It was him\n                   or you.\n\n        Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing\n        form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a\n        last flicker of life.\n\n        Kuato's body is dead white.  Quail releases his grip;\n        he about to give up when --\n\n        A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck.\n        It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body\n        over.  The Head is still alive!\n\n        Quail bends closer, kneeling.\n\n                                 ORACLE HEAD\n                           (whispers)\n                   -- the vengence you seek...\n                   and the salvation of Mars...\n                   are waiting for you in the\n                   crown of the Sphinx.\n                           (sags, gasping)\n\n        The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a\n        small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its\n        mouth.\n\n                                 BENNIE\n                   Phobos and Demos!

The streets are even busier then before -\n        people are now beginning to evacuate the city.

Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw\n        arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles\n        in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed\n        swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to\n        Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed.\n\n        Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him.\n        Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND\n        in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying\n        appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay.\n        But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring\n        blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when --\n\n        Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to\n        Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade\n        weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and --\n\n        The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms\n        sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE\n        CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL\n        VACUUM!\n\n        Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks,\n        [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges\n        with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges,\n        grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie --\n\n        The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp-\n        ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES\n        BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall!\n\n        Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws\n        desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum\n        pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers --\n\n\n122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY\n\n        Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon\n        with all its air gone.\n\n\n122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY\n\n        Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant --\n\n\n122A    EXT.

Loud-\n        speakers call for Quail's surrender.\n\n\n122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY\n\n        Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button\n        marked \"Dive\".  The vehicle tilts.\n\n\n122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY\n\n        The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the\n        patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,\n        the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the\n        Sphinx looms ominously.\n\n        A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside\n        the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't\n        be heard but can only be radioing a report.\n\n\n123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND\n\n        The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by\n        its BORER NOSE.\n\n        Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up\n        the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING\n        as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in\n        the control panel.  He makes a correction.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (shouts over\n                            engine noise)\n                   Hope I've got this direction\n                   right.\n\n        Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the\n        encounter with patrol cars.\n\n        CU speedometer:  22 MPH.

TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX\n\n        The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped\n        horizontal tunnel.  Quail and Melina leap out.  The poor\n        Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.  Its nose\n        is worn to a nub.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   We got in with this thing,\n                   but we'll never get back out.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   A shame.

MAIN DOWNSHAFT\n\n        They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the\n        MAIN DOWNSHAFT.  Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the\n        drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye\n        can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and\n        super-sophisticated technology.\n\n        Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of\n        the main downshaft.  They can look up the shaft and\n        see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (points down\n                            shaft)\n                   This is the main tap --\n                   straight down to the core\n                   of Mars.

Just as\n        they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the\n        ready:\n\n                                 QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                           (from behind the\n                            guards)\n                   I'm not there, boys.

With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he\n        dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out\n        of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)\n\n        Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo\n        belts.

SPHINX - DAY\n\n        Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,\n        pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --\n\n\n143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM\n\n        A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere)\n        detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a\n        storm of shards and shrapnell.\n\n        Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian\n        vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   Seal the breach!  Repressurize!\n\n        An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now --\n\n        Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto\n        an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are\n        choking, struggling with their masks.\n\n        An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the\n        breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal\n        atmosphere stabilizes --\n\n        None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The\n        victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level.\n        Melina hurries to the main control panel.\n\n        Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a\n        dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   Those shuttles are starting up\n                   any minute.  If you know how\n                   to work this thing, you better\n                   do it now.\n\n        Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex\n        machinery.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Yes...\n\n        He hesitates.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   Don't you know how?\n\n        Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control\n        panel.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Yes... there's a vital\n                   connection missing...\n\n        He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm\n        towards a blank area a little above his head.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   ...me...\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   Wait!\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   Don't wait!\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   If you activate the mechanism\n                   you'll die...there were\n                   glimpses of it in your\n                   memory.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a\n                   long tunnel, a brilliant\n                   white light, hands reaching\n                   for me...\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                           (assured)\n                   That's your death.  That's\n                   what it looks like.  That's\n                   what is always looks like.\n\n        Quail looks around him, half-convinced.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                           (looking toward\n                            space shuttles\n                            on video screens)\n                   Charles - for Mars's sake....\n\n        Quail hesitates.  He looks from Melina to Cohaagen.\n\n                                 COHAAGEN\n                   It's not too late.  Join us\n                   again.  U've a lot to offer.\n                   A whole world.\n\n        Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   You don't deserve a new world,\n                   you and people like you made\n                   too big a mess of the old one.\n                   Time someone else had a\n                   chance.\n\n        He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm\n        again.  His fingers reach towards the blank section on\n        the panel.  Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand\n        reaches toward Quail's fingers.  Gently, the fingers of\n        the two hands touch.\n\n        The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder.  As\n        Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him.\n        They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen\n        only intermittently as debris crashes around them.\n\n        The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and\n        disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him.\n\n\n144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL\n\n        A reprise of the sequence that opened the movie.\n\n        Quail RUNS THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  THE GROUND\n        HEAVES BENEATH HIM ... HUGE STONE BLOCKS CRASH DONW ON\n        ALL SIDES!  We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,\n        each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last --\n\n        Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs.  Is this\n        his own death?  Where is Melina?\n\n        The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's\n        original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and\n        quartz.\n\n        Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder.\n        The EXPLOSIONS are closer.  Suddenly --\n\n        Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  Quail sees it,\n        but it only terrifies him more.  Is it death he's running\n        to?  He hurries on with all his strength, but --\n\n        Just as he nears the white light, HE FALLS.  On his knees,\n        too weak to move.  He struggles --\n\n        HANDS ARE REACHING OUT TO HIM, from out of the brilliant\n        light.  Quail stretches for them, just as --\n\n        A FINAL EXPLOSION blows him forward -- straight into the\n        WHITE LIGHT!  The HANDS SEIZE HIM, pull him upward to --\n\n\n145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY\n\n        The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting\n        rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was\n        taking them to the Space Port.  Quail looks from them to\n        Melina, who is walking towards the group.\n\n        \n        QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES\n\n        The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add\n        to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured\n        perspective --\n\n\n        BACK TO QUAIL\n\n        In terror, lost, disoriented totally.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   Am I dying?\n\n                                 MASKED MINER\n                   I won't lie to you, pal.\n                   You are.\n\n                                 MINER (from Melina's bar)\n                   I'd say in about forty years...\n                           (he and others\n                            help Quail to\n                            his feet)\n                   ...come on, we've gotta get\n                   to the Space Port.

Mars\n                   is finished.\n\n        A MINER'S WIFE watches them.  She is crying.\n\n        Quail looks up at the sky.  Melina follows his glance.\n        So do the others.\n\n        Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow\n        to blue.\n\n                                 MELINA\n                   It's happening.\n\n                                 MINER\n                   What is it?\n\n        All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.  Quail reaches\n        toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his\n        breathing apparatus.  At first the man is shocked, then\n        realizes he can breathe without it.  Quail takes off\n        his own, then Melina's\n\n        All the miners watch in amazement.  They all remove their\n        breathing masks.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                   That's just the start.  Next\n                   there'll be rain and growth\n                   and ... life.\n\n        Melina embraces him.\n\n                                 QUAIL\n                           (continuing)\n                   Rekall could never have come\n                   up with anything like this.\n\n        Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.\n\n        As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners\n        descend from the bus.  Softly at first, then with more and\n        more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National\n        Anthem.\n\n        The music swells.  Quail puts his arm around Melina.  They\n        both join in the chorus.\n\n        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES\n        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.\n\n\n                             THE END\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nTotal Recall\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ronald Shusett\u00a0\u00a0Dan O'Bannon\u00a0\u00a0Steven Pressfield\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:28.433576"}
