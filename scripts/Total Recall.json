There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and\n        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,\n        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.\n        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in\n        the process.\n\n<b>        SLOW DISOLVE\n</b>\n<b>        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.\n</b>\n        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre\n        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.\n<b>        DISSOLVE.\n</b>\n        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some\n        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-\n        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks\n        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion\n        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...\n\n        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the\n        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is\n        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,\n        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are\n        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES\n        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.\n\n        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.\n        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)\n        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.\n\n        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be\n        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a\n        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of\n        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...\n\n\n<b>2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW \"SPHINX\" - DAY\n</b>\n        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH\n        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,\n        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,\n        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS\n        over a portion of it.\n\n        The surface of the tunnel's \"walls\" is curious;  the walls\n        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two\n        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material\n        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.\n\n        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-\n        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.\n        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,\n        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a\n        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.\n\n        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT\n        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.\n\n        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING\n        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to\n<b>        SAFETY.\n</b>\n        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;\n        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --\n        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED\n        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out\n        of molten lava.\n\n<b>        SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE:\n</b>\n<b>                                TOTAL RECALL\n</b>\n<b>        HOLD.\n</b>\n<b>                                                      DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>3       INT.

Then he sits up\n        in bed.\n\n        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the\n        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in\n        thought.\n\n        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early\n        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is\n        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.\n\n        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing\n        for her slippers.\n\n<b>                                 QUAIL\n</b>                   I dreamed about Mars again... it\n                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...\n\n<b>                                 KIRSTEN\n</b>                           (casual)\n                   It's your time of the month again.\n\n        Quail looks at her quizzically.\n\n<b>                                 KIRSTEN\n</b>                           (continuing;\n                            world-weary air)\n                   At least once a month.

He meditates on what she said,\n        depressed.\n\n\n<b>4       INT.

CITY - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern\n        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)\n        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a\n        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and\n        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on\n        briskly.\n\n\n<b>5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a\n        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.\n\n        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass\n        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body\n        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly\n        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.\n\n<b>                                 GUARD\n</b>                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?\n\n<b>                                 QUAIL\n</b>                   I keep forgetting, Herb.

Most are pre-fabricated structures.\n        The streets are crowded and there is a \"frontier-town\"\n        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water\n        and air containers.\n\n        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and\n        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the\n        dome.\n\n        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around\n        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws\n        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow\n        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....\n\n<b>                                 BOY\n</b>                   Smogpsucker!\n\n        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with\n        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC\n<b>        SONG.\n</b>\n<b>                                 DOORMAN\n</b>                   You know how it is, sir.

MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\n        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency\n        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE\n        BOY looks up at Quail.\n\n        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium\n        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the\n        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in\n        spotless linen fill the lobby.\n\n        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on\n        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model\n        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written \"THE FIRST WONDER\n        OF MARS\".

QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.\n        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.\n\n        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.\n        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written\n        in longhand:\n\n<b>                                 \"MELINA NOEL\n</b>                           Last Chance Air Station\n                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9\"\n\n\n<b>60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET\n</b>\n        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly\n        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-\n        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.\n\n        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a\n        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.\n\n        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine\n        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing\n        Quail.\n\n        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is\n        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West\n        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.\n\n<b>                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)\n</b>                   Need a cab, boss mon?\n\n        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.\n\n<b>                                 BENNIE\n</b>                           (continuing)\n                   Mine's right around the corner.\n\n<b>                                 QUAIL\n</b>                           (indicating first\n                            cab in line)\n                   That one's closer.\n\n<b>                                 BENNIE\n</b>                   But I out-hustle him, right?\n\n<b>                                 QUAIL\n</b>                           (smiling)\n                   Right.\n\n        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the\n        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar\n        car.\n\n\n<b>62      EXT.

DESERT - SUNSET\n</b>\n        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed\n        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.\n        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is\n        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.\n\n\n<b>68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT\n</b>\n        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in\n        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities\n        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:\n<b>        \"LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS\".\n</b>\n        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is\n        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore\n        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,\n        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-\n        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.\n\n\n<b>69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\n        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There\n        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is\n        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-\n        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors\n        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.\n\n        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.

Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.\n\n        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into\n        Quail.

Quail,\n        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns\n        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.\n\n        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the\n                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)\n\n        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front\n        of her, unsure about what to do.

They\n        both join in the chorus.\n\n        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES\n        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.\n\n\n<b>                             THE END\n</b>\n\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Total Recall</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ronald Shusett\" title=\"Scripts by Ronald Shusett\">Ronald Shusett</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Dan O'Bannon\" title=\"Scripts by Dan O'Bannon\">Dan O'Bannon</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steven Pressfield\" title=\"Scripts by Steven Pressfield\">Steven Pressfield</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Total Recall Script.html#comments\" title=\"Total Recall comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:18:34.906395"}
