NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY\n\n\n\tA SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,\n\tsurreal, six-foot tall \"IDOLS.\"  Like modern demons. \n\tGrotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of\n\ttheir twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,\n\tbroken glass teeth.\n\n\tEXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY\n\n\tTwo vehicles, one a Volkswagen \"bus\" decorated with stylized\n\tflames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series\n\tof eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of\n\tsand and heat.\n\n\tEND CREDITS.\n\n\t\t\t\tCUT WIDE TO;\n\n\tEXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY\n\n\tA violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just\n\tmake out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William\n\tNix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. \n\tThe \"family\" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON\n\tSCREEN, the words:  '\"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago\"\n\n\tEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tWe're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning\n\tagainst the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about\n\tsixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,\n\talmost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,\n\tthe other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a\n\tscalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield\n\tnarrows his eyes.\n\n\tBUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe Volkswagen \"bus\" and Thunderbird are approaching the\n\thouse.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tSwann...?\n\n\tHe turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's\n\twhittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY\n\n\tThe house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has\n\tbecome the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic\n\tcult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse\n\ta little of what life here is like. \n\n\tThe rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with\n\tscenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from\n\tsome unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING\n\thelpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and\n\toppressive. \n\n\tThe passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his\n\tway to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the\n\tfloor, light these claustrophobic corridors.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tMaster?\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY\n\n\tA dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of\n\ttheir leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his\n\tshoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice\n\tseductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. \n\n\tAll the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -\n\twear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. \n\tThey watch Nix in adoration. \n\n\tAs Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to\n\thand with casual ease...\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tAnd the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,\n\t\tyou're my instrument. From now on,\n\t\tyou'll be called the Puritan...\n\n\t\t\t\tCULTISTS\n\t\t\t(murmuring)\n\t\tPuritan...\n\n\tNIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,\n\ttogether you will cleanse the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tCULTISTS\n\t\tYes...\n\n\tButterfield enters. \n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tMaster?\n\n\tNix looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tSwann's here. \n\n\tNix rises, smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(to Cultists)\n\t\tWe'll come back to this. Get about\n\t\tyour business. \n\n\tAs the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY\n\n\tA place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling\n\tis another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a\n\tlarge man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and\n\tknotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,\n\tcreaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a\n\tperverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.\n\n\tFrom the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft\n\tSOBBING.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tHush...\n\n\tNix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and\n\tpresently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a\n\tfetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her\n\tmouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tI said hush.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tPlease.  Let me go.\n\n\tFrom the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. \n\tNix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(to Baboon)\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\tThe Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring\n\tits teeth as it screeches.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(to Girl)\n\t\tI think he's in love.\n\n\tHe unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,\n\ttrailing its chain.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tKeep it away from me.\n\n\tNix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon\n\tstarts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS\n\tcatching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tPlease... please...\n\n\tNix watches her terror dispassionately.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\t\t(also watching, wide-\n\t\teyed)\n\t\tWant me to shoot Swann?\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tYou don't like him, do you?\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tHe wants your magic.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tMaybe.  Go fetch him.\n\n\tButterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tWhat are you going to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY\n\n\tThe two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.\n\n\tFrom the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old\n\twith shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not\n\tconventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. \n\n\tFrom the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,\n\tstudious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,\n\tskinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a\n\tsteely gaze.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\t\t(to all three)\n\t\tAre we ready?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(cool)\n\t\tSay the word.\n\n\t\t\t\tPIMM\n\t\t\t(very nervous)\n\t\tLook, maybe we should think this over.\n\n\tOn Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces\n\tof METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as\n\the slips them into his pocket.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tNo.  He's gone too far.\n\n\t\t\t\tPIMM\n\t\tSo he took a child.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tHe'll kill her.\n\n\t\t\t\tPIMM\n\t\tNo he won't.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\t\t(determined)\n\t\tHe's not going to get the chance.\n\n\tQuaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tIf he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tSo stay out here.\n\n\tSwann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to\n\tfollow, with the other two on her heels.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\tButterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tHe's expecting you.\n\n\tBehind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\t\t(to others)\n\t\tLook around.  If you find 'the\n\t\tchild, yell.  She's got blonde\n\t\thair, that's all I know.\n\n\tButterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows\n\thim.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - \"MEDITATION\" ROOM - DAY\n\n\tQuaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS\n\t(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is\n\tbreast-feeding a baby.\n\n\t\t\t\t1ST MAN\n\t\tHey, Quaid.  I thought you said you\n\t\tweren't coming back.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tI changed my mind.\n\n\t\t\t\t1ST WOMAN\n\t\tCome and join us.\n\n\tShe smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE\n\tappears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. \n\n\tAnd now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the\n\tCultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns\n\taway.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,\n\twinding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and\n\tdrives his heel down on its head.\n\n\t\t\t\tSNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST\n\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tDon't do that!\n\n\tThe Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. \n\tSnake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above\n\this head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.\n\n\tINT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   \"BEDROOM\"   -  DAY\n\n\tJennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where\n\ta BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tDon't be afraid.\n\n\tThe Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth\n\tpressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,\n\tof course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARBARA\n\t\tI'm not... want to see?\n\n\tShe pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into\n\ther FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer\n\tretreats to the door, and exits back out into --\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n\tPimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He\n\tis ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from\n\this white-knuckled fingers.\n\n\t\t\t\tPIMM\n\t\tHe's going to kill us all...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tWhere did Swann go?\n\n\tPimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY\n\n\tSwann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to\n\this belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. \n\tHe turns the door handle.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY\n\n\tSwann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The\n\tfolds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a\n\tmuffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. \n\n\tOn the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.\n\n\tSwann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As\n\the approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!\n\n\tHe reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half\n\tdressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. \n\n\tSwann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n\tOn Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the\n\tpassageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tStay the fuck away!\n\t\t\t(yells)\n\t\tPimm!  Get over here!\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY\n\n\tPAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he\n\tstruggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the\n\tground beside her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tYou're going to be okay.\n\n\tOut of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings\n\tround.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque\n\taltarpiece. \n\n\tThe Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her\n\tface.  Swann turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tI knew you'd come. \n\n\tHe reaches down to Swann.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tI've got so much power to give\n\t\tyou, Swann.  All you have to do\n\t\tis...beg.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tFuck you.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tYou don't think I've got it to\n\t\tgive?\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tNo!\n\n\tSuddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying\n\tgravity.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tYou're wrong.\n\n\tHe catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back\n\tagainst the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tI could eat your fucking soul,\n\t\tSwann.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n\tJennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps\n\tfrom the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's\n\thand.  BLOOD SPURTS.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tFuck!\n\n\tShe retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY\n\n\tNix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his\n\tfingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a\n\tpsychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tYou want to know what the world\n\t\treally looks like?\n\n\tSwann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. \n\n\tAnd now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin\n\tof Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tWant to see flesh with a god's\n\t\teyes?\n\n\tSwann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.\n\n\tINT.

These are your\n\t\tfriends.\n\n\tOn Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and\n\tJennifer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER (V.O.)\n\t\tWhat have you done to him? \n\nSWANN'S P.O.V.\n\n\tof Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to\n\tbe MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is\n\tlike a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID (V.O.)\n\t\tSwann.  It's okay.\n\n\tQuaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his\n\thead violently.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tDon't touch me.

The trigger is\n\tpulled. \n\n\tThe bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.\n\n\tON SWANN, staring at Nix. \n\n\tSWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. \n\n\tJust for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses\n\tsomething else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE\n\tFACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its\n\tforehead. \n\n\tSwann covers his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(raging, terrifying)\n\t\tSwann!

Nix collapses to the ground,\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tQuickly!\n\n\tThey have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his\n\tjacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are\n\tSCREWS in then all.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(seeing)\n\t\tSwann?  What are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tBinding you.\n\n\tHe clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an\n\teyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his\n\thands on the side of the mask, and \u0097 LIKE MAGIC -- his touch\n\tmakes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into\n\tNix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs\n\tfrom the screw-holes.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tFuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!\n\n\tNow the second piece, over his MOUTH.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tSw\u0097\n\n\tHe's silenced.

Again, it screws itself into\n\tplace. \n\n\tSwann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as\n\tit continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as\n\teach man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? \n\n\tAnd now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes\n\tdiminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the\n\tground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tIs it finished?\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tIt's finished.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n\tThe Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix\n\thad upon them has disappeared.

He watches, with a feral look on his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\t\t\t\tFADE IN\n\n\tEXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY\n\n\tThe city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and\n\tgleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking\n\tsome fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and\n\tcongestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.\n\n\tON SCREEN, the words:  \"LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER\"\n\n\tEXT.

QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n\tAn illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,\n\tpast faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.\n\n\tAt the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry\n\thalts, and takes out his GUN. \n\n\tThere's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the\n\tcorner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of\n\tpassageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a\n\tCRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is\n\tthe source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it\n\tfalls down the stairs. \n\n\tDead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open\n\tdoor.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique\n\tFURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.\n\n\tINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThere are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into\n\twhich Harry now steps.

Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the\n\tshadows. \n\n\tHis name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth\n\tsharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle\n\tof his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and\n\tgoes for his throat. \n\n\tHarry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST\n\tand SMASHES it on Miller's skull. \n\n\tMiller reels back.

In the middle of the room, a\n\ttable.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been\n\ttortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude\n\tfrom his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the\n\ttable in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.\n\n\tHarry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tWhat the fuck!?\n\n\tHarry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the\n\tdoor.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tShit!\n\n\tHarry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. \n\n\tAs he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A\n\tFIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his\n\tlate twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long\n\thair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -\n\tone black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. \n\tHis hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(to Butterfield)\n\t\tDon't touch him.\"\n\n\tButterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs\n\tin pain. \n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tWhat are you going to do about it? \n\n\tMiller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the\n\tother side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock\n\tout.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\t\t(to Harry)\n\t\tEver watched a man die?  If you\n\t\twatch very closely, you can\n\t\tsometimes see the soul escaping. \n\t\tAnd if you're very quick, you can\n\t\tcatch it.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tPlease... Butterfield...

They knew the Puritan\n\t\twas coming home. \n\n\tAs this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the\n\tdoor and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other\n\tside.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being\n\tpitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of\n\tdefense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the\n\ttable.  Behind it a WINDOW.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tSo do you.  You've seen the future. \n\t\tHaven't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n\t\tAnd are you afraid?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tSuddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller\n\tCHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him\n\tagainst the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down\n\taround Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. \n\n\tButterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the\n\tscalpel from his hands. \n\n\tMiller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the\n\tfolds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's\n\tbelly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,\n\twhich SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. \n\n\tHarry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already\n\tmaking his escape.  Harry starts after him.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\t\t(to Harry)\n\t\tDon't leave me.\n\n\tHe turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry\n\tgoes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the\n\tstairs.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tYou need an ambulance.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUAID\n\t\t\t(in pain)\n\t\tToo late.  Why are you here?

He descends on the\n\tdragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the\n\tDevil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. \n\tThe theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.

At the table - besides Harry\n\tand Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend\n\tLAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and\n\ttwo of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,\n\toverdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,\n\twaspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. \n\n\tIn the conversation that follows we go back to Harry\n\trepeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINOVICH\n\t\tIt's more than entertainment.

Oh God no!\n\n\tShe backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.\n\n\t\t\t\tNURSE\n\t\tCalm down!\n\n\tShe delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.

There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of\n\tmetalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the\n\tNurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.

The DRIVER is out, and yelling\n\tincoherently. \n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tJesus.\n\n\tHe slips back down the wall, and leans against it.\n\n\tHe looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. \n\tHis mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his\n\thead appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from\n\ta grave.

In glass cases, the tools\n\tof the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an\n\tIRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed\n\twhile Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they\n\tinvestigate.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tI hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tYou heard right.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tYou ever been married?\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tYeah.

So fucking\n\t\thokey.\n\n\tInside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tWhat have we got here?\n\n\tEver-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- \n\n\ttwo spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! \n\n\tHarry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from\n\tskewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his\n\tsinews straining.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tGrab the files!\n\n\tBilly reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he\n\tsteps out of range.

He's trembling.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tI could have lost my fucking hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tThat would have kept you out of the\n\t\tMagic Circle.\n\t\t\t(he studies the files)\n\t\tWhich was presumably the idea.\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tThese are about Nix.\n\n\tHarry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tYou go through these.  Go on!\n\n\tReluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded\n\tPHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil\n\tpainted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. \n\tThere are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY\n\t-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for\n\tthat) - is NIX.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tWait a minute...\n\n\tHe stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different\n\tcolours.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tThat's Butterfield...\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\t(points to nan in)\n\t\tdoorway)\n\t\tAnd who's that?\n\n\tON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. \n\n\tON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tAt a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.\n\n\tBilly picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows\n\ta horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH\n\tof another man's HEAD.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tTake a look at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(looking at it)\n\t\tA Nix specialty?\n\n\tBilly is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching\n\tdown and starts to go through others in the series.  We\n\tglimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a\n\tserpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at\n\this own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone\n\tbeneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see\n\ta HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating\n\tDARKNESS.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tI don't know any of these tricks...\n\n\tHarry studies the etchings.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(a slow burn)\n\t\tMaybe they're not tricks.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\t(mystified)\n\t\tI mean, there's no instructions--\n\t\t\t(realizes what Harry said)\n\t\tWhat do you mean, they're not\n\t\ttricks?\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tWhat did Vinovich say? Something\n\t\tabout walking a path between --\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tTrickery and divinity.  Yeah, he\n\t\tsays that all the time.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tThat's because he knew.  He'd seen\n\t\tthese files and knew.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tKnew what?\n\n\tOut of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the\n\tbook-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his\n\tlips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. \n\tHarry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. \n\n\tSomething eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A\n\tfigure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.\n\n\tHarry takes out his gun. \n\n\tBilly disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry\n\tgoes after the apparition. \n\n\tThe TRACK is completely silent. \n\n\tSuddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,\n\tits face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. \n\n\tIt tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who\n\tbacks away.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tHarry!\n\n\tBooks tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the\n\tshelves.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tWhere the fuck are you?\n\n\tHarry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tOkay.  Hold it right there.\n\n\tThe gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made\n\tof smoke. \n\n\tHarry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. \n\n\tBut it's still terrorizing Billy.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\t(in mortal terror)\n\t\tGet it off me!\n\n\tHarry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some\n\tbooks.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The \"Psycho\"\n\tvanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tHokey enough for you?\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tI'm out of here, man!  Are you\n\t\tcoming?\n\n\tHarry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tI'm coming.\n\n\tBilly is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses\n\tto look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked\n\tgates. \n\n\tAs he does so --\n\n\t-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the\n\t\"Psycho\" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tAh, shaddup!\n\n\tHe FIRES at the projector a second time.\n\n\tOn the GUN SHOT --\n\n\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT.

You\n\t\tthink a little courage, a little\n\t\tlove, and it'll all be all right. \n\t\tWrong!\n\n\tHis fingers slide all the way in!\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tOh God!\n\n\tHarry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes\n\tare BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tTell me where she is... and I'll\n\t\tmake it go away...\n\n\tHarry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face\n\tSCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! \n\n\tON HARRY, verging on insanity.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tOh God... oh God...\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tHarry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of\n\tsome glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her\n\tface.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her\n\tdevourer.\n\n\tON HARRY\n\n\tas he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. \n\tReaching out for the image.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe Woman reaches for Harry.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN           \n\t\tHelp me.\n\n\tON HARRY\n\n\tas he touches the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tDorothea!\n\n\tHe starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is\n\tpainted.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tDorothea!  Dorothea!\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tDarkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still\n\tscreaming when she disappears.\n\n\tINT.

NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT\n\n\tON HARRY \n\n\tliterally beating his head against the wall!\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tNo!  No!  No!\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA (V.O.)\n\t\tHarry...\n\n\tHarry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tIt's not real, Harry-\n\n\tHarry turns around.  Dorothea is there.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tFor a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.\n\n\tON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\t-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by\n\tprimeval muck. \n\n\tON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tHarry.  Listen to me. Whatever's\n\t\tgood between us, believe it.\n\n\tHarry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's\n\tfighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t... oh... God...\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tI'm here, Harry.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t...yes?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tNix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(to Dorothea)\n\t\tThere you are, child. \n\n\tHarry starts to look round.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tDon't look.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tI... have... to.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tCome on, child.  I want Swann to\n\t\tsee you die. \n\n\tHarry turns and looks at Nix.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tNix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle\n\tof his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\t\t(to Harry)\n\t\tWhat are you looking at?\n\n\tON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room\n\tand now slips inside. \n\n\tON HARRY, staring up at Nix.\n\n\tON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her\n\thand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(points to his brow)\n\t\tThere... there!\n\n\tON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. \n\n\tON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. \n\n\tThe bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,\n\tBLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE\n\tused to be.\n\n\tON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the\n\twall, shaking.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tHarry?\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tI'm okay.  I'm okay.\n\n\tHarry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.\n\n\tHARRY'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she\n\tactually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they\n\tembrace. \n\n\tSuddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --\n\n\t-- it isn't over. \n\n\tOne last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he\n\tkneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS\n\tup his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his\n\tforehead --\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tOne... last... illusion...\n\n\t-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of\n\tthe bullet wound.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n\t\tOh my God.\n\n\tHarry and Dorothea start to get up... \n\n\tNix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,\n\tstripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible\n\telement on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an\n\tutterly inhuman SHRIEK!\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN (V.O.)\n\t\t... D'Amour...\n\n\tHarry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.\n\tSwann is on the threshold. \n\n\tNix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk\n\tsomehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. \n\n\tHe comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into\n\tthe Meditation Room.\n\n\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThe pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is\n\tbacked towards it by Nix. \n\n\tWhen Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is\n\tDEMONIACAL.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tI am the purest of the pure.  I am\n\t\tthe darkest of the dark...\n\n\tHarry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tHarry.  You can't kill him. \n\n\tHarry crouches beside Swann.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tHe did something with the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tYes?\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tCan you do it?\n\n\t\t\t\tSWANN\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\tTry.\n\n\tON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX (V.O.)\n\t\tI'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond\n\t\tHell.\n\n\tSuddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. \n\tNix topples.\n\n\tON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. \n\n\tA wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's\n\tbroken fingers -- \n\n\t-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like\n\tcorpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces\n\tresurfacing --\n\n\tBarbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       \n\tthe edge of the pit.\n\n\t\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t\t(to Dorothea)\n\t\tGet out of here!\n\n\tThe ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging\n\taround Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's\n\tHarry, of course. \n\n\tNix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh\n\thim down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper\n\thold, and Harry still clings to his legs.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIX\n\t\tNo!  No!  No!\n\n\tHe's at the edge of the pit.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA (V.O.)\n\t\tHarry!\n\n\tHarry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the\n\tflowing ground to offer him a hand. \n\n\tNix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he\n\treaches for Harry, as -- \n\n\t-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. \n\n\tTogether they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. \n\tThey look back to see \n\n\tNIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. \n\n\tAt the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She\n\tcloses his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. THE PIT\n\n\tWhat we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-\n\tdeath by any villain in the history of cinema... \n\n\tNix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES\n\tagainst a layer of stone, which his body smashes to\n\tsmithereens.  And as he falls --\n\n\tINT.

Nix keeps falling, breaking through another\n\tlayer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the\n\tearth. \n\n\tAnd now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.
