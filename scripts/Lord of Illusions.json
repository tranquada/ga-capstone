NEVADA DESERT - DAY\n</b>\n\tA violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just\n\tmake out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William\n\tNix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. \n\tThe \"family\" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON\n\tSCREEN, the words:  '\"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago\"\n\n<b>\tEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n\tWe're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning\n\tagainst the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about\n\tsixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,\n\talmost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,\n\tthe other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a\n\tscalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield\n\tnarrows his eyes.\n\n<b>\tBUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.\n</b>\n\tThe Volkswagen \"bus\" and Thunderbird are approaching the\n\thouse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tSwann...?\n\n\tHe turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's\n\twhittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.\n\n<b>\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has\n\tbecome the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic\n\tcult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse\n\ta little of what life here is like. \n\n\tThe rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with\n\tscenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from\n\tsome unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING\n\thelpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and\n\toppressive. \n\n\tThe passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his\n\tway to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the\n\tfloor, light these claustrophobic corridors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\tMaster?\n\n<b>\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tA dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of\n\ttheir leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his\n\tshoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice\n\tseductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. \n\n\tAll the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -\n\twear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. \n\tThey watch Nix in adoration. \n\n\tAs Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to\n\thand with casual ease...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tAnd the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,\n\t\tyou're my instrument.

Hanging from the middle of the ceiling\n\tis another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a\n\tlarge man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and\n\tknotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,\n\tcreaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a\n\tperverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.\n\n\tFrom the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft\n<b>\tSOBBING.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tHush...\n\n\tNix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and\n\tpresently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a\n\tfetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her\n\tmouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tI said hush.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tPlease.  Let me go.\n\n\tFrom the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. \n\tNix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\t\t(to Baboon)\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\tThe Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring\n\tits teeth as it screeches.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\t\t(to Girl)\n\t\tI think he's in love.\n\n\tHe unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,\n\ttrailing its chain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tKeep it away from me.\n\n\tNix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon\n\tstarts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS\n\tcatching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tPlease... please...\n\n\tNix watches her terror dispassionately.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\t\t(also watching, wide-\n\t\teyed)\n\t\tWant me to shoot Swann?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tYou don't like him, do you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\tHe wants your magic.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tMaybe.

NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.\n\n\tFrom the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old\n\twith shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not\n\tconventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. \n\n\tFrom the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,\n\tstudious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,\n\tskinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a\n\tsteely gaze.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSWANN\n</b>\t\t\t(to all three)\n\t\tAre we ready?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n</b>\t\t\t(cool)\n\t\tSay the word.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPIMM\n</b>\t\t\t(very nervous)\n\t\tLook, maybe we should think this over.\n\n\tOn Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces\n\tof METALWORK.

Jennifer is the first to\n\tfollow, with the other two on her heels.\n\n<b>\tINT.

NIX'S HOUSE - \"MEDITATION\" ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tQuaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS\n\t(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is\n\tbreast-feeding a baby.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t1ST MAN\n</b>\t\tHey, Quaid.

Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE\n\tappears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. \n\n\tAnd now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the\n\tCultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns\n\taway.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,\n\twinding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and\n\tdrives his heel down on its head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST\n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tDon't do that!\n\n\tThe Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. \n\tSnake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above\n\this head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.\n\n<b>\tINT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   \"BEDROOM\"   -  DAY\n</b>\n\tJennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where\n\ta BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n</b>\t\tDon't be afraid.\n\n\tThe Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth\n\tpressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,\n\tof course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARBARA\n</b>\t\tI'm not... want to see?\n\n\tShe pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into\n\ther FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer\n\tretreats to the door, and exits back out into --\n\n<b>\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n</b>\n\tPimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He\n\tis ashen with terror.

NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY\n</b>\n\tSwann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The\n\tfolds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a\n\tmuffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. \n\n\tOn the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.\n\n\tSwann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As\n\the approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!\n\n\tHe reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half\n\tdressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. \n\n\tSwann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.\n\n<b>\tINT.

Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque\n\taltarpiece. \n\n\tThe Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her\n\tface.  Swann turns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tI knew you'd come. \n\n\tHe reaches down to Swann.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tI've got so much power to give\n\t\tyou, Swann.

There's a short length of\n\tpassageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a\n\tCRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is\n\tthe source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it\n\tfalls down the stairs. \n\n\tDead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open\n\tdoor.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.

Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle\n\tof his forehead.

A\n\tFIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his\n\tlate twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long\n\thair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -\n\tone black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. \n\tHis hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHARRY\n</b>\t\t\t(to Butterfield)\n\t\tDon't touch him.\"\n\n\tButterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.

It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being\n\tpitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of\n\tdefense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the\n\ttable.

Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. \n\n\tButterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the\n\tscalpel from his hands. \n\n\tMiller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the\n\tfolds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's\n\tbelly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,\n\twhich SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. \n\n\tHarry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already\n\tmaking his escape.  Harry starts after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tQUAID\n</b>\t\t\t(to Harry)\n\t\tDon't leave me.\n\n\tHe turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face.

In another, a MAN stares at\n\this own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone\n\tbeneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.

Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments\n\tand STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of\n\ttime. \n\n\tThe BLADE catches him in the arm, however.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSWANN\n</b>\t\tAah!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\tGo on, bleed.\n\t\t\t(he slashes at Swann\n\t\tagain)\n\t\tGo on!  Go on!\n\n\tButterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a\n\twall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across\n\tthe floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tNo!\n\n\tHe falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to\n\twatch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD\n\trunning from his wound.\n\n<b>\tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tHarry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses\n\tthe still-sticky ground.

He lets\n\t\tDorothea slip from his arms.  \n\n\tHarry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of\n\tDorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN\n\tgoes spinning across the ground, back towards the door\n\tleading to the passageway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOROTHEA\n</b>\t\tOh God!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHARRY\n</b>\t\tHang on!\n\n\tNix reaches down to torment Harry.

His face is horribly burned, but he's\n\tstill very much alive.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUTTERFIELD\n</b>\t\tBastard!\n\n\tHe launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the\n\tBROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the\n\tPassageway. \n\n\tNix has Swann in a bear-hug.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tWill you help me? \n\n\tA beat.  Then Swann nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSWANN\n</b>\t\tYes.\n\n\tNix lets him go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tYou know I'll kill you when we're\n\t\tdone.

One to the ribs. \n\tThey CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,\n\tone to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards\n\tDorothea.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tShe's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.\n\t\tI'll show you!\n\n\tHe moves towards Dorothea.

Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and\n\trunning off into the darkness. \n\n\tButterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time\n\tfor this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,\n\tand Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see\n\tthe impact.  HEARING it's enough. \n\n\tHarry looks down at the body.  Then --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tWhere is she? \n\n\tHarry turns.\n\n\tNix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's\n\tbody as he comes at Harry!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNIX\n</b>\t\tWhere did she go?\n\n\tNix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the\n\tfingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES.

They look towards him --\n\n\t-- it isn't over. \n\n\tOne last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he\n\tkneels in the GLASS.
