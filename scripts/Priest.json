CITY FIVE/DISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A\r\n          seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with\r\n          soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and\r\n          stretch.\r\n\r\n          A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS\r\n          Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a\r\n          massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying\r\n          another day's toll.\r\n\r\n          A TATTOOED FIGURE\r\n          moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way.\r\n          They do this not out of respect. . .but fear.\r\n          We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES --\r\n          Shaved head.\r\n          Eyes like nail guns.\r\n          Tendons clenching over muscle.\r\n          As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it.\r\n          He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with.\r\n          surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness\r\n          to them. Malignant.\r\n          The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head --\r\n          Something's caught his attention...\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The exit just in sight.\r\n          At the last second --\r\n          He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The\r\n          hat still gripped tightly in his hand as he's dragged away.\r\n          our two Priests reach for him but it's too late ...He\r\n          disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Barely.\r\n          In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent\r\n          down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to\r\n          Priest.\r\n          But he's gone.\r\n          Off her reaction we CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT.
