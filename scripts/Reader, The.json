He is 51, dark-\n          haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate\n          quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom\n          to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an\n          egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a\n          sparkling clean plate.\n<b>          \n</b>          MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the\n          sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,\n          turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and\n          BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger.

HANNA has a blanket and a\n          cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she\n          irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and\n          puts it over one of the chairs.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              MICHAEL\n</b>                    I would have come earlier, but I've\n                    been in bed for three months.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              HANNA\n</b>                    You're better now?\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                 MICHAEL\n</b>                    Thank you.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              HANNA\n</b>                    Have you always been weak?\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              MICHAEL\n</b>                    Oh no.

I couldn't even be\n                    bothered to read.\n<b>          \n</b>          HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with\n          the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.\n          He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks\n          broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She\n          puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she\n          upends the iron.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              HANNA\n</b>                    I have to go to work. I'll walk\n                    with you.

But as she is about to put\n          the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her\n          dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he\n          blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door\n          slams.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT. STAIRS.
