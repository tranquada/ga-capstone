MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS\n          \n          1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is\n          preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-\n          haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate\n          quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom\n          to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an\n          egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a\n          sparkling clean plate.\n          \n          MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the\n          sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,\n          turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and\n          BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The\n          credits end.\n          \n                              BRIGITTE\n                    You didn't wake me.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    You were sleeping.\n          \n                              BRIGITTE\n                    You let me sleep because you can't\n                    bear to have breakfast with me.\n          \n          It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Nothing could be further from the\n                    truth. I boiled you an egg. See?\n          \n          MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from\n          nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I'd hardly have boiled you an egg\n                    if I didn't want to see you. Tea or\n                    coffee?\n          \n          BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing\n          gown.

He looks at the mess of last night's love-making.\n          Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn\n          goes by.\n          \n          INT. TRAM. DAY.\n          \n          December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is\n          in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone\n          shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his\n          face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out.\n          \n          INT. TRAM. DAY\n          \n          1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets\n          off at the next stop.\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          1995. MICHAEL closes the window.\n          \n          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY\n          \n          1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the\n          street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway\n          leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to\n          get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a\n          wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS\n          walks past.\n          \n                                                                    3.\n          \n          \n          MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand\n          over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the\n          pavement and seizes him by the arm.\n          \n                                HANNA\n                    Hey. Hey!\n          \n          HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.\n          She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket\n          of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down\n          with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Hey, kid. Hey.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n          \n          Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his\n          head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly\n          he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Where do you live?\n          \n          EXT. STREET. DAY\n          \n          HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted\n          with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his\n          satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.\n          \n          EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY\n          \n          They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops\n          outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    It's here. I'll be fine now.

HANNA is left alone.\n          She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping\n          uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.\n          MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.\n          \n          INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT\n          \n          CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner\n          through for the BERG family, at a round table in a\n          traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.\n          \n                                                                   4.\n          \n          \n          MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating\n          in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS,\n          18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY.\n          MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.\n          \n                              CARLA\n                    I'm worried about him.

DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently\n          inflamed.

At least.\n          \n          MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head.\n          Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He\n          turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.\n          \n                              CARLA\n                    Keep away.

MICHAEL's bed has been moved\n          beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is\n          sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving\n          round behind him, tidying the room.\n          \n                              CARLA\n                    How are you feeling?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Better.

DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is\n          looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The\n          woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.\n          \n          INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay -\n          green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a\n          sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.\n          Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red\n          flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a\n          moment.\n          \n                               HANNA\n                    Come in.\n          \n                                                                   6.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A\n          stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs.\n          There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the\n          room. HANNA carries on ironing.\n          \n                               MICHAEL\n                    I brought you these flowers. To say\n                    thank you.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Put them down there.\n          \n          MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a\n          cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she\n          irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and\n          puts it over one of the chairs.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I would have come earlier, but I've\n                    been in bed for three months.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You're better now?\n          \n                                 MICHAEL\n                    Thank you.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Have you always been weak?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Oh no. I'd never been ill before.\n                    It's incredibly boring. There's\n                    nothing to do. I couldn't even be\n                    bothered to read.\n          \n          HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with\n          the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.\n          He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks\n          broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She\n          puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she\n          upends the iron.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    I have to go to work. I'll walk\n                    with you. Wait in the hall while I\n                    change.\n          \n          MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly\n          open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.\n          Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.\n          \n                                                                     7.\n          \n          \n          She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and\n          knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the\n          other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,\n          riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put\n          the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her\n          dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he\n          blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door\n          slams.\n          \n          INT. STAIRS. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the\n          front door.\n          \n          EXT. COURTYARD. DAY\n          \n          The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming\n          the outer door.\n          \n          INT. BEDROOM. DAWN\n          \n          MICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram\n          going by outside.\n          \n          EXT. STREET. DAWN\n          \n          The tram making its way along the quiet street.\n          \n          INT. BEDROOM. DAWN\n          \n          MICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.\n          \n          INT. TRAM. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as\n          HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next\n          stop. She doesn't see him as she works.\n          \n          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is standing on the other side   of the street from\n          HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds   about whether to go in.\n          The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to\n          finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way\n          to the stairs.\n          \n          INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then,\n          as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in\n          uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the\n          other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.\n          \n                                                                   8.\n          \n          \n          \n                              HANNA\n                    There are two more buckets\n                    downstairs. You can fill them and\n                    bring them up.\n          \n          HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if\n          there might be some contact. But she goes by.\n          \n          INT. CELLAR. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a\n          flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke,\n          poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and\n          picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it\n          comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          HANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She\n          has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes\n          in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy.\n          She roars with laughter, full-throated.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You look ridiculous, look at you,\n                    kid.\n          \n          MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got\n          up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You can't go home like that. Give\n                    me your clothes, I'll run you a\n                    bath.\n          \n          HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water\n          comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    What, do you always take a bath in\n                    your trousers?\n          \n          HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He\n          undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    It's all right, I won't look.\n          \n          On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.\n          MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He\n          gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he\n          submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out\n          in the open air.\n          \n                                                                   9.\n          \n          \n          When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his\n          clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands\n          it to him.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Wash your hair, I'll get you a\n                    towel.\n          \n          MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes\n          back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,\n          turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his\n          body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts\n          her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He\n          turns and faces her.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    So. That's why you came back.\n          \n          MICHAEL looks at her, awed.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    You're so incredibly beautiful.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Now, kid, you know that's not true.\n          \n          At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL\n          goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,\n          she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his\n          eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand\n          over his mouth to smother the noise.\n          \n          INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT\n          \n          The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting\n          watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.\n          \n                              PETER\n                    You've inconvenienced your mother.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    How many more times?

That's why I was late.\n                    Can I have some more?\n          \n          He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of\n          contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.\n          \n                                                                  10.\n          \n          \n          \n                              EMILY\n                    How can anyone get lost in their\n                    own home town?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    The doctor told me I had to take\n                    walks.\n          \n                              EMILY\n                    So?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I meant to head for the castle, I\n                    ended up at the sports-field.\n          \n                              EMILY\n                    They're in opposite directions.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    It's none of your business.\n          \n                              EMILY\n                    He's lying.\n          \n                              CARLA\n                    He's not lying.

PETER is looking at him, seeming to know\n          what's going on.\n          \n                                                                     11.\n          \n          \n          \n          EXT.

The whole SCHOOL is coming\n          out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving\n          goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.\n          \n          INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA'S\n          apartment is ajar. He pushes it open.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          HANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing\n          off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops\n          his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about\n          twenty seconds. He stands sweating.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    All right, kid, it's not just about\n                    you.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          They are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads\n          his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to\n          move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she\n          comes.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          HANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake,\n          looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of\n          the wood yard below.

You may say the\n                    whole idea of character in fiction\n                    is defined by people holding\n                    specific information which for\n                    various reasons - sometimes\n                    perverse, sometimes noble - they\n                    are determined not to disclose.\n          \n          MICHAEL looks content.

MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed.\n          There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.\n          MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite\n          direction, alone.\n          \n          EXT.

DAWN\n          \n          An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets.\n          MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.\n          \n          INT. TRAM. DAWN\n          \n          MICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The\n          CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him.\n          MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and\n          looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no\n          acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns,\n          bewildered.\n          \n          EXT. TRAM. DAY\n          \n          The tram is heading out of town.\n          \n          INT. TRAM. DAY\n          \n          HANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are\n          getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL\n          is still by himself in the second carriage, looking foolish.\n          \n                                                                    16.\n          \n          \n          \n          EXT.

DAY\n          \n          HANNA is now in the busy second carriage, collecting tickets.\n          MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket,\n          HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away\n          without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and\n          MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks\n          around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by,\n          WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back\n          to town.\n          \n          INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is on the stairs as HANNA comes up, in her uniform.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    What was all that about?\n          \n          HANNA lets herself in, saying nothing.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          HANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen\n          table.

I was on your tram!\n                    You totally ignored me! What do you\n                    think I was doing? Why the hell do\n                    you think I was there?\n          \n          MICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight\n          in the eye.\n          \n                                                                  17.\n          \n          \n          \n                              HANNA\n                    I haven't the slightest idea. And\n                    what you do is your business not\n                    mine.\n          \n          HANNA turns and moves away.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    And if you wanted to speak to me, I\n                    was in the first carriage. So why\n                    did you sit in the second?\n          \n          HANNA goes to run a bath.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    And now, thanks very much, I've\n                    been working, I need a bath. Get\n                    out, I'd like to be by myself.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I didn't mean to upset you.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You don't have the power to upset\n                    me. You don't matter enough to\n                    upset me.\n          \n          She takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he\n          gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself,\n          miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and\n          goes back in. She is still in the bath.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I don't know what to say. I've\n                    never been with a woman. We've been\n                    together four weeks and I can't\n                    live without you. I can't. Even the\n                    thought of it kills me.\n          \n          HANNA looks at him thoughtfully.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I sat in the second carriage\n                    because I thought you might kiss\n                    me.\n          \n                               HANNA\n                    Kid, you thought we could make love\n                    in a tram?\n          \n          They smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question.\n          \n                                                                    18.\n          \n          \n          \n                                MICHAEL\n                      Is it true what you said?

MICHAEL and a STAMP\n          DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering\n          his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the\n          STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much\n          as he hopes.\n          \n                                                                  22.\n          \n          \n          Then MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of\n          notes are handed across.

They walk away towards\n          their bikes. He is smiling. MICHAEL looks round, then dares\n          to reach across and kiss her on the lips. The WAITRESS\n          watches.\n          \n          EXT. CHURCH. DAY\n          \n          They get off their bikes at a small church.

DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL and HANNA enter tentatively to find a choir\n          rehearsing Bach. It is a traditional German scene - whole\n          families singing together at the altar. HANNA is transported,\n          entranced at the sound of the music. MICHAEL watches.\n          \n          EXT. RIVERSIDE. DAY\n          \n          HANNA is in a river, the water up to her calves, her skirt\n          tied round her thighs. She is completely absorbed.

He opens its\n          yellowing pages and looks at the poetry. Then flips the\n          pages, to some handwritten lists - the words `Odyssey',\n          `Schnitzler', `Chekhov', `Zweig' with numbers beside them.\n          MICHAEL flaps it shut, puts it back and turns to go out.\n          \n          INT.

DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is listening on the radio to the same Bach music they\n          heard in the church. He drives through the thriving modern\n          city. Beyond, the huge cranes and gouged-out building sites\n          of a city under construction.\n          \n          EXT. STREET. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL swings his car into place.

The JUDGE looks\n          at MICHAEL disapprovingly, sensing his lateness. Everyone\n          sits. MICHAEL sits, thinking back.\n          \n                                                                     25.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. STAIRWAY. SCHOOL.

In fact, The\n                    Odyssey is a book about a journey.\n                    Home is a place you dream of, it's\n                    not a place you ever attain.\n          \n          The TEACHER breaks off.\n          \n                                                                   26.\n          \n          \n          \n                              TEACHER\n                    Berg, I don't mean to distract you,\n                    but we're meant to studying Homer,\n                    not studying Sophia.\n          \n          The whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes.\n          \n          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the\n          water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels.\n          It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their\n          hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches.\n          \n                              HOLGER\n                    Michael the water's fantastic.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    It's wonderful, isn't it?\n          \n                              HOLGER\n                    Wonderful.

There is a sudden\n          silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks\n          down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff.\n          \n                                                                  27.\n          \n          \n          \n                              SOPHIE\n                    Why do you leave early?\n          \n                              HOLGER\n                    He always leaves early.\n          \n          EXT.

Isn't that what you\n                    want?\n          \n          HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and\n          slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets\n          up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed.\n          \n                               MICHAEL\n                    And it's always me that has to\n                    apologize.\n          \n          Silence.

The\n          smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops\n          lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and\n          she washes his body.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          They are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point\n          she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her\n          hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she\n          lets go.\n          \n          INT.

Then she picks up her luggage and leaves\n          the empty apartment.\n          \n          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE.

He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He\n          opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that's\n          about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He\n          lies down on the bed.\n          \n                                                                  31.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT.

NIGHT\n          \n          MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out\n          into the night.

The\n                    war ended twenty years ago.\n                    Remember, there've been no\n                    significant trials between\n                    Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz\n                    trials a couple of years ago.\n                    That's a long gap. What's the\n                    reason for the gap?\n          \n          ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer.\n          \n                              DIETER\n                    I'd have thought it was obvious.\n          \n                              ROHL\n                    Say.\n          \n                              DIETER\n                    Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't\n                    it? It's bad conscience. It's the\n                    big cover-up.\n          \n                              ROHL\n                    Go on.\n          \n                              DIETER\n                    After the war.

I don't love them. How could\n                    I? How could anyone love them?\n                    Because they've told themselves so\n                    many lies, they can't remember the\n                    truth, let alone admit it.

Forgive me, nor is\n                    it about getting into an emotional\n                    state. It has no purpose if it's\n                    just the young giving their parents\n                    a bad time.\n          \n          There's a silence.

But they\n                    don't. They operate by something\n                    called law. You're not guilty of\n                    anything merely by working at\n                    Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at\n                    Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been\n                    convicted, and only 6 for murder.\n                    To prove murder you have to prove\n                    intent. That's the law.

At the end of\n                    the month's labour, every month,\n                    sixty inmates were selected. They\n                    were picked out to be sent from the\n                    satellite camp back to Auschwitz.\n                    That's right, isn't it?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Yes, it's right.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    And so far, each of your fellow\n                    defendants has specifically denied\n                    being part of that process. Now I'm\n                    going to ask you. Were you part of\n                    it?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Yes.\n          \n          There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court.\n          They start talking to their LAWYERS.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    So you helped make the selection?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Yes.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    You admit that? Then tell me, how\n                    did that selection happen?\n          \n          HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.\n          \n                                                                  45.\n          \n          \n          \n                              HANNA\n                    There were six guards, so we\n                    decided we'd choose ten people\n                    each. That's how we did it - every\n                    month. We'd all choose ten.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    Are you saying your fellow\n                    defendants took part in the\n                    process?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    We all did.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    Even though they've denied it? But\n                    you admit it. You're saying you\n                    took part in the process.\n          \n          The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is\n          intent, following his own line.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    Did you not realise you were\n                    sending these women to their\n                    deaths?\n          \n          He waits.

There\n                    wasn't room.\n          \n          The JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem\n          to understand his point.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    No, but what I'm saying : let me\n                    rephrase : to make room, you were\n                    picking women out and saying `You\n                    you and you have to be sent back to\n                    be killed.'\n          \n                                                                  46.\n          \n          \n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Well, what would you have done?\n          \n          HANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight\n          question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in\n          the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is\n          impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly\n          asks herself a question.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    So should I never have signed up at\n                    Siemens?\n          \n          INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two\n          women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is\n          composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and\n          ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a\n          CLERK leans in to the younger woman.\n          \n                              CLERK\n                    Ms. Mather, they're ready for you\n                    now.\n          \n          The two women go into the court. The door closes.\n          \n          INT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go\n          back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The\n          sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see\n          that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is\n          conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of\n          the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly\n          into the back of the room as the trial goes on.\n          \n          MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near\n          ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across\n          to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one\n          of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.\n          \n                              PROSECUTOR\n                    In your book you describe the\n                    process of selection...\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Yes. You were made to work and\n                    then, when you were no longer any\n                    use to them, then they sent you\n                    back to Auschwitz to be killed.\n          \n                                                                  47.\n          \n          \n          \n                              PROSECUTOR\n                    Are there people here today who\n                    made that selection?\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Yes.\n          \n                              PROSECUTOR\n                    I need you to identify them. Can\n                    you please point them out?\n          \n          ILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS.\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Her. And her. And her. And her. And\n                    her. And her.\n          \n          The last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA\n          does not react.\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Each of the guards would choose a\n                    certain number of women. Hanna\n                    Schmitz chose differently.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    In what way differently?\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    She had favourites. Girls, mostly\n                    young. We all remarked on it, she\n                    gave them food and places to sleep.\n                    In the evening, she asked them to\n                    join her. We all thought - well,\n                    you can imagine what we thought.\n          \n          HANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches.\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Then we found out - she was making\n                    these women read aloud to her. They\n                    were reading to her. At first we\n                    thought this guard, this guard is\n                    more sensitive, she's more human,\n                    she's kinder. Often she chose the\n                    weak, the sick, she picked them\n                    out, she seemed to be protecting\n                    them almost. But then she\n                    dispatched them. Is that kinder?\n          \n          HANNA looks back, not apologizing.\n          \n                                                                  48.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

It was the winter of 1944. Our\n                    camp was closed down, we were told\n                    we had to move on. But the plan\n                    kept changing every day. Women were\n                    dying all around us in the snow.\n                    Half of us died on the march. My\n                    daughter says in the book, less a\n                    death march, more a death gallop.\n          \n          MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.\n          \n                              JUDGE\n                    Please tell us about the night in\n                    the church.\n          \n          MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares\n          back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if\n          accepting she must go ahead and speak.\n          \n                              ROSE\n                    That night we actually thought we\n                    were lucky because we had a roof\n                    over our heads. We'd arrived in a\n                    village, as always, the guards took\n                    the best quarters, they took the\n                    priest's house. But they let us\n                    sleep in a church. There was a\n                    bombing raid. In the middle of the\n                    night. At first we could only hear\n                    the fire, it was in the steeple.\n                    Then we could see burning beams,\n                    and they began to crash to the\n                    floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to\n                    the doors.

HANNA walks past\n          the mail room and goes to the library counter.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    I want to take out a book.\n          \n                              LIBRARIAN\n                    Which book?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Do you have The Lady with the\n                    Little Dog?\n          \n                              LIBRARIAN\n                    What's your name?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Hanna Schmitz.\n          \n                                                                  68.\n          \n          \n          \n          The LIBRARIAN goes to get it. HANNA stands, waiting and looks\n          at the stacks of books, for the first time seeing\n          possibility.\n          \n          INT. CELL. DAY\n          \n          HANNA is back in the cell. She puts down a new parcel and a\n          book. She puts the parcel to one side, then opens the book.\n          She then winds back the tape which is already in the\n          recorder.\n          \n                              MICHAEL'S VOICE\n                    The Lady with the Little Dog, a\n                    story by Anton Chekhov. The talk\n                    was...\n          \n          She turns off the tape. She runs her finger along the title\n          `The Lady with the Little Dog'. She gets down a small\n          decorated metal tin, and takes a pencil from it. She starts\n          making the sounds. `The', `the', `the'... L, L, L, etc.\n          \n          INT. CELL. NIGHT\n          \n          HANNA is working now, circling the word `the' each time it\n          comes in the book. The book is covered in marks.\n          \n          EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE\n          \n          1981. MICHAEL is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street. He is\n          37. He goes into his block. He opens the door : the place is\n          much more lived-in. He picks up his mail. Thumbing through\n          it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting. MICHAEL frowns,\n          opening it and taking out a piece of paper.\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE\n          \n          MICHAEL is holding a letter. He looks down at the writing :\n          `Thanks for the latest, kid. I really liked it.' He stares,\n          then puts it down and steps back stunned.\n          \n          INT. CELL. DAY\n          \n          HANNA stands with a new package. She opens it excitedly. She\n          takes out tapes. She looks for writing, a letter. There is\n          none. She turns the packing paper over and over, but there's\n          nothing. She stands, desolate.\n          \n          INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE\n          \n          HANNA effortfully writing various letters - just a single\n          message on each. The pen working agonizingly across the\n          paper. First :\n          \n                                                                     69.\n          \n          \n          \n          I WOULD LIKE MORE ROMANCE, LESS ADVENTURE\n          \n          Next:\n          \n          I AM NOT SURE WHAT KAFKA IS SAYING\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          MICHAEL continuing to read to her on the machine.\n          \n          INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE\n          \n          HANNA still writing.\n          \n          DO YOU STILL LIKE DICKENS?\n          \n          Then finally, many attempts at the same sentence, written\n          many times :\n          \n          DO YOU RECEIVE MY LETTERS? WRITE TO ME, KID\n          \n          INT. STUDY. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is reading the latest letter from HANNA. He looks at\n          it. \"Do you receive my letters? Write to me, kid.\" MICHAEL\n          opens a drawer in a file box on the floor. There is a stack\n          of her letters inside. He puts the latest on top of the pile\n          and closes the drawer.\n          \n          INT. CELL. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          HANNA stands at her window, in despair.\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY\n          \n          1988.

BRENNER'S OFFICE. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          MS BRENNER is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office.\n          \n                               MS BRENNER\n                    Hanna has been in prison for over\n                    twenty years. She has no family.\n                    She has no friends. You're her only\n                    contact. And I'm told you don't\n                    visit her.\n          \n          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is sitting quite still.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    No. I don't.\n          \n          INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE.

She's going to need\n                    somewhere to live. You can't\n                    imagine how frightening the modern\n                    world will seem to her.\n          \n          There is a silence.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Yes.

If you\n                    don't take responsibility for her,\n                    then Hanna has no future at all.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    It's kind of you. Thank you for\n                    letting me know.\n          \n          MICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been\n          handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is\n          now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to\n          his balcony.\n          \n          EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony.\n          \n                                                                    71.\n          \n          \n          \n          EXT.

DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS\n          BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let\n          MICHAEL in.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    You're Michael Berg?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Yes.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    Louisa Brenner.

DAY\n          \n          MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison\n          canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    I should warn you: for a long time\n                    Hanna held herself together. She\n                    was very purposeful. In the last\n                    few years she's different. She's\n                    let herself go.\n          \n          INT. CANTEEN. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          MS BRENNER leads MICHAEL to the door of the canteen.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    They're in the canteen. They're\n                    just finishing lunch.\n          \n          MICHAEL sees an OLD WOMAN who is sitting at a table. Her blue\n          dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. Her hair\n          is grey. She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it.\n          A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.\n          \n          It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA.\n          Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and\n          looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back,\n          but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look\n          and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked\n          at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She\n          smiles, weary.\n          \n                                                                  72.\n          \n          \n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You've grown up, kid.\n          \n          She takes his hand. There is a long silence, MICHAEL unable\n          to think of anything to say. He withdraws his hand.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I've got a friend who's a tailor,\n                    he makes my suits. He'll give you a\n                    job. And I've found you somewhere\n                    to live. It's a nice place. Quite\n                    small but nice. I think you'll like\n                    it.\n          \n                                 HANNA\n                    Thank you.\n          \n          There's a moment's silence.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    There are various social\n                    programmes, cultural stuff I can\n                    sign you up for. And there's a\n                    public library very close.\n          \n          HANNA nods slightly.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    You read a lot?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    I prefer being read to.\n          \n          There is a short silence.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    That's over now, isn't it?\n          \n          MICHAEL doesn't answer.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Did you get married?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I did. Yes I did. We have a\n                    daughter. I'm not seeing as much of\n                    her as I would like. I'd like to\n                    see a great deal more of her.\n          \n          After a few moments, he concedes.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    The marriage didn't last.\n          \n                                                                  73.\n          \n          \n          \n          There is a silence.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Have you spent a lot of time\n                    thinking about the past?\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    You mean, with you?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    No. No, I didn't mean with me.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Before the trial I never thought\n                    about the past.

The other PRISONERS have already\n          gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for\n          his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward.\n          \n                              HANNA\n                    Take care, kid.\n          \n                               MICHAEL\n                    You too.\n          \n          They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of\n          saying goodbye, she takes his hand.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    See you next week.\n          \n          She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand,\n          then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone.\n          \n          EXT. PRISON. EVE\n          \n          MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment,\n          looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.\n          \n          INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE\n          \n          The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the\n          other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture.\n          The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over\n          the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went\n          cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.\n          \n          INT. CELL. DAWN\n          \n          HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and\n          gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by\n          one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes.\n          She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.\n          Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.\n          \n          EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of\n          flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the\n          GUARD who is in a modern office.\n          \n          INT. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on\n          a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in\n          his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.\n          \n                                                                    75.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY\n          \n          The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at\n          the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The\n          books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,\n          a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the\n          door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed\n          bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    She didn't pack. She never intended\n                    to leave.\n          \n          MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the\n          two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the\n          cassette machine.\n          \n          Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from\n          magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.\n          One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL\n          kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,\n          articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish\n          handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through\n          the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the\n          young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school\n          principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school\n          literature prize.'\n          \n          MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she\n          sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet\n          of paper from her suit pocket.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    She left me a message, a sort of\n                    will. I'll read out the bit that\n                    concerns you.\n          \n          MICHAEL looks at the effortful handwriting on the page.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    \"There is money in the old tea tin.\n                    Give it to Michael Berg. He should\n                    send it, alongside the 7,000 marks\n                    in the bank, to the daughter who\n                    wrote the book. It's for her. She\n                    should decide what to do with it.\n                    And tell Michael I said hello. Tell\n                    him to get on with his life.\"\n          \n          MS BRENNER looks at him.\n          \n                              MS BRENNER\n                    Do you want to see her?\n          \n                                                                  76.\n          \n          \n          \n          MICHAEL shakes his head.\n          \n          EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the\n          familiar skyline.\n          \n          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an\n          expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the\n          Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.\n          \n          INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA'S APARTMENT. DAY\n          \n          A superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art.\n          MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears,\n          elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of\n          prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.\n          \n                                 MICHAEL\n                    Ms Mather?\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Yes.

It's as simple as\n                    this.

I sent her\n                    tapes. She'd always liked being\n                    read to.\n          \n          ILANA shifts slightly.\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    Why don't you start by being honest\n                    with me?

But the camps\n                    weren't therapy. What do you think\n                    these places were? Universities? We\n                    didn't go there to learn.

Or do you just\n                    want to feel better yourself? My\n                    advice, go to the theatre, if you\n                    want catharsis. Please. Go to\n                    literature. Don't go to the camps.\n                    Nothing comes out of the camps.\n                    Nothing.\n          \n                                                                  79.\n          \n          \n          \n          ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    What she wanted...what she wanted\n                    was to leave you her money.

Sentimental things. A piece of\n                    hair from our dog. Some tickets to\n                    operas my father had taken me to.\n                    It wasn't stolen for its contents.\n                    It was the tin itself which was\n                    valuable, what you could do with\n                    it.\n          \n          She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    There's nothing I can do with this\n                    money. If I give it to anything\n                    associated with the extermination\n                    of the Jews, then to me it will\n                    seem like absolution and that is\n                    something I'm neither willing nor\n                    in a position to grant.\n          \n          MICHAEL nods slightly.\n          \n                                                                  80.\n          \n          \n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I was thinking maybe an\n                    organization to encourage literacy.\n          \n                                ILANA\n                    Good.\n          \n          There's a silence.\n          \n                                ILANA\n                    Good.\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    Do you know if there's a Jewish\n                    organization?\n          \n                              ILANA\n                    I'll be surprised if there isn't.\n                    There's a Jewish organisation for\n                    everything. Not that illiteracy is\n                    a very Jewish problem.\n          \n          There is the shadow of a smile.\n          \n                               ILANA\n                    Why don't you find out?

DAY\n          \n          ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street\n          where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.\n          When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.\n          There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA\n          with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin\n          down beside the photo.\n          \n          INT & EXT. CAR. DAY\n          \n          1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through\n          the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a\n          sideways look at him, but he does not respond.\n          \n                                                                     81.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JULIA\n                    Where are we going?\n          \n                              MICHAEL\n                    I thought you liked surprises.\n          \n                              JULIA\n                    I do.

MICHAEL and JULIA get\n          out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.\n          \n          EXT. CEMETERY. DAY\n          \n          MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole\n          cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple\n          stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988.
