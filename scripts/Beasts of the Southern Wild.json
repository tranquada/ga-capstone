HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN\r\n                         \r\n          An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall\r\n          oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling\r\n          metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that\r\n          surely no one lives here.\r\n                         \r\n          But then, a light goes on.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a\r\n          baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an\r\n          unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of\r\n          unmistakable wisdom.\r\n                         \r\n          Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen\r\n          on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice.\r\n          Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by\r\n          DISTANT THUNDER.

Mosta\r\n           the time they probably just sayin'\r\n           \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I gotta poop,\"\r\n           but sometimes they talkin' in\r\n           codes.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells-\r\n                         \r\n           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Get up, get out of here!\r\n                         \r\n           We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room.\r\n                         \r\n           A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson\r\n           Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris\r\n           and discarded appliances.\r\n                         \r\n           A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and\r\n           brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This\r\n           is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39).\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK\r\n           Get your pants on, man!\r\n                         \r\n           Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into\r\n           a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15\r\n           feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer\r\n           cans.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY\r\n                         \r\n           We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler\r\n           with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the\r\n           grill.\r\n                         \r\n           He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food.\r\n                         \r\n           He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer.

ABANDONED BUS - DAY\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands,\r\n           getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks\r\n           really yummy.\r\n                         \r\n           Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around\r\n           her.\r\n                         \r\n           A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of\r\n           the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws\r\n           corn to the chickens.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK\r\n           Share with the dogs.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a\r\n           filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body.\r\n           This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a\r\n           handsome young pup.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n           WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh.\r\n           They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil\r\n           drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat\r\n           reads \"The Turck\", Hushpuppy's spelling of \"Truck\".\r\n                         \r\n           They look out to where the water goes all the way to a\r\n           monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the\r\n           distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction\r\n           we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from\r\n           rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with\r\n           a peaceful and confident disdain.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression.\r\n                         4\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          WINK\r\n           Ain't that ugly over there?\r\n                         \r\n           He takes a long pull on his beer.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           We live in the prettiest place on\r\n           earth.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side. It's an\r\n           endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree\r\n           or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern\r\n           world.\r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           Daddy says, up above the levee, on\r\n           the dry side, they're afraid of the\r\n           water like a bunch of babies. They\r\n           built the wall that cuts us off.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

The rag tag band of revelers charge forward\r\n           WHOOPING and SHOUTING.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. \"Isle de\r\n           Charles Doucet\" is crossed out and someone has graffitied\r\n           \"The Bathtub.\" Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and\r\n           smack in wild, ritualistic fashion.\r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           The Bathtub's got more holidays\r\n           than the whole rest of the world.\r\n                         5\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY\r\n                         \r\n           The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags\r\n           trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to\r\n           themselves that makes a lot of noise.\r\n                         \r\n           They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives,\r\n           downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a\r\n           community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon.\r\n                         \r\n           We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern\r\n           society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class,\r\n           race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place\r\n           of true and honest unity.\r\n                         \r\n           Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun\r\n           band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass\r\n           players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck\r\n           bounces them down a dirt road.\r\n                         \r\n           They drive under a banner reading \"Welcome to the Bathtub\r\n           Storm Season!\"\r\n                         \r\n           Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the\r\n           front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a\r\n           giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes,\r\n           metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs\r\n           clamber on top.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into\r\n           the mouths of the crowd.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the\r\n           tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the\r\n           thick of everything.

No\r\n           one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night\r\n           fishing in the Bathtub.\r\n                         \r\n           Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one\r\n           another for dear life.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with\r\n           virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She\r\n           studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her\r\n           Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain\r\n           anything, but we sense there is a system of education in\r\n           place here.\r\n                         7\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking\r\n           it's last breaths of air.\r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           One day, the storm's gonna blow,\r\n           the ground's gonna sink, and the\r\n           water's gonna rise up so high,\r\n           there ain't gonna be no Bathtub,\r\n           just a whole bunch of water.\r\n                         \r\n           She pick up a crab, pets its belly. The DIN of the party\r\n           fades down around her as she listens to its HEARTBEAT.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

Men\r\n           dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of\r\n           reckless esoteric ritual.\r\n                         \r\n           The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding.\r\n           We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled\r\n           joy, that a cloud hangs over this community. The people are\r\n           parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel\r\n           viscerally, that it could be.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a\r\n           fountain sparkler. Wink trips and falls.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink lies on his back on the ground. He sees his daughter\r\n           watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh\r\n           with sheer joy.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his\r\n           face, the fuse burning. He nods his approval. They watch\r\n           the fuse burn down to the last moment. She turns it upward,\r\n           and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming\r\n           mortars.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces.\r\n           He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her.\r\n                         \r\n           They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the\r\n           pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a\r\n           BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub. Throw your fist in\r\n           the air! These are the survivors, those who fight for their\r\n           joy and their history to the last man.\r\n                         8\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           But me and my Daddy, we stay right\r\n           here.

He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything.\r\n                         \r\n           He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK\r\n           This side is still Wink's house.\r\n           No toys, and no girl stuff over\r\n           here.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the\r\n           line.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           So if I want to come over that side\r\n           and smack you in the face, that's\r\n           against the rules. So there's a\r\n           plus for you.\r\n                         23\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           Now come on down here and get in\r\n           the boat, man.\r\n                         \r\n           He points to a trunk on the floor. Hushpuppy hops down and\r\n           gets in. Wink sits on his air mattress.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           If the water get real high, we\r\n           gonna float to the top and we gonna\r\n           bust through the roof and we gonna\r\n           ride away, okay?\r\n                         \r\n           Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           You never NEVER take these off.\r\n           I'm your Daddy, and you do what I\r\n           tell you to do, because it's my job\r\n           to keep you from dying, ok? So sit\r\n           back and just listen to me...\r\n           Close your eyes and go to sleep.\r\n           CLOSE YOUR EYES!\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep. The THUNDER\r\n           scares the bejesus out of him again.\r\n                         \r\n           She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in\r\n           steadily.\r\n                         \r\n           Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor\r\n           bottle. He resumes his phony sleep.\r\n                         \r\n           A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs\r\n           out of bed.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           Why you starin' at me like that? I\r\n           can't sleep with you starin' at me\r\n           like that.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink paces the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           Listen. You need to understand,\r\n           you're a kid and I'm a man.\r\n                         \r\n           She doesn't understand.\r\n                         24\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           What, you scared?\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy nods. THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who\r\n           flinches.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           Don't be scared, no storm can't\r\n           beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show\r\n           you. You watch.\r\n                         \r\n           But he can see she's still scared.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're\r\n           not scared of no damn storm.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in\r\n           the floor into the storm.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out.\r\n                         \r\n           OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full\r\n           sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off\r\n           and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him.\r\n                         \r\n                          WINK (CONT'D)\r\n           Look at me!

PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n           Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a\r\n           mammoth body onto the shoreline.\r\n                         \r\n           It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal\r\n           begins to roll over.\r\n                         \r\n           Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself\r\n           up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she\r\n           stares into the distance.\r\n                         \r\n           The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands\r\n           of years of sleep.\r\n                         \r\n           She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR.\r\n                         \r\n           We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something\r\n           dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the\r\n           frame as she starts forward on her journey.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY\r\n                         \r\n           Silence. The storm has passed.\r\n                         \r\n           The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses\r\n           poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n           A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water.\r\n                         \r\n           Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a\r\n           roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab.\r\n                         \r\n           Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell.\r\n           Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too.\r\n                         \r\n           The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new\r\n           world.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

Neither he nor\r\n           Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every\r\n           organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming.\r\n                         26\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           For every animal that didn't have a\r\n           Dad to put it in a boat, the end of\r\n           the world already happened.\r\n           They're all down below, trying to\r\n           breathe through water.\r\n                         \r\n           They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on\r\n           stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed\r\n           through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

Wink\r\n           shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl\r\n           is not ready for survival.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

She\r\n           runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging\r\n           behind her.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n           The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck.\r\n                         \r\n           They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) -\r\n                         \r\n           A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache,\r\n           saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these\r\n           runts with an air of suspicion.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUSHPUPPY\r\n           I'm going by my Mamma.\r\n                         \r\n           He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him\r\n           and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is\r\n           understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.\r\n                         \r\n                          SERGEANT MAJOR\r\n           That's a good place to go.\r\n                         64\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated\r\n           wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls\r\n           create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another\r\n           dimension.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUSHPUPPY\r\n           Which way are we going?\r\n                         \r\n                          SERGEANT MAJOR\r\n           Don't matter baby, this boat'll\r\n           take you exactly where you need to\r\n           be. It's just that type of boat.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else\r\n           we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old\r\n           teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences\r\n           last.\r\n                         \r\n           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)\r\n           You want a chicken biscuit?\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'.\r\n                         \r\n           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)\r\n           They're good for you.\r\n                         \r\n           A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on\r\n           a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The\r\n           wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers.\r\n                         \r\n           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)\r\n           I been eating these all my life. I\r\n           keep the wrappers in the boat,\r\n           `cause they remind me who I was\r\n           when I ate each one. The smell\r\n           make me feel cohesive.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUSHPUPPY\r\n           I wanna be cohesive. \r\n                         \r\n                          SERGEANT MAJOR\r\n           Oh you will be, I got no doubt in\r\n           my mind.\r\n                         \r\n           They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel\r\n           chair back toward the water\r\n                         65\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go\r\n           wide.\r\n                         \r\n           As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half-\r\n           sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the\r\n           same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up\r\n           sign: \"Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS\r\n           GIRLS.\"\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge\r\n           with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a\r\n           hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away\r\n           JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to\r\n           each other in wonder.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland.\r\n           Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke\r\n           facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at\r\n           a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans\r\n           Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their\r\n           ladies of the night.\r\n                         \r\n           There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along\r\n           with \"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\" by Fats Waller.\r\n                         \r\n           The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this\r\n           establishment, comes a'hoppin'.\r\n                         \r\n                          MISS FRANKIE\r\n           Holy crap you have toddlers!\r\n                         \r\n                          SERGEANT MAJOR\r\n           Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.\r\n                         \r\n                          MISS FRANKIE\r\n           Well butter my butt and call me a\r\n           biscuit!

Joy Strong puts up her fists.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry\r\n           of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They\r\n           are not who she is looking for.\r\n                         \r\n           She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up\r\n           all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it,\r\n           none of them right.\r\n                         \r\n           Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes,\r\n           ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious\r\n           dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.\r\n                         \r\n           She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.\r\n                         \r\n           SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the\r\n           swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles.\r\n           It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where\r\n           a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the\r\n           swinging doors. They open.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy holds her breath.\r\n                         \r\n           A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron\r\n           comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her\r\n           brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold\r\n           beer.\r\n                         \r\n           The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOK\r\n           You need something baby?\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOK (CONT'D)\r\n           Well whatchu want? You alone?\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy shrugs.\r\n                         \r\n           She's too stunned, too shy to speak.\r\n                         67\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of\r\n           her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy,\r\n           she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOK (CONT'D)\r\n           Get in here, I'm'll show you a\r\n           magic trick.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her\r\n           head against the swinging doors on her way in.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           INT.

She watches the\r\n           Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single\r\n           motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail\r\n           on the table and begins sawing through the scales.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOK\r\n           Lemme tell you somethin', when\r\n           you're a child people tell you that\r\n           everything's gonna be all hunky-\r\n           dory and all that bullshit, but I'm\r\n           here to tell you that it's not.

She barely remembers how to\r\n           smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head,\r\n           opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOK (CONT'D)\r\n           Nobody likes a pity-party-having-\r\n           ass-woman.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of\r\n           dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe.

She looks into them in all her\r\n           grief and wisdom.\r\n                         \r\n           The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the\r\n           background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre.\r\n                         \r\n                          PETER T\r\n           As I stand by the bayou,\r\n                         \r\n           Everyone else joins him.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVERYONE\r\n           A ship at my side starts her motors\r\n           and sails for the gulf. I watch\r\n           her until she disappears. \"There!\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n                         75\r\n                         \r\n                          EVERYONE (CONT'D)\r\n           She's gone!\" Gone where? Gone\r\n           from my eyes, that's all. She's\r\n           just as big as when she left me.\r\n           And somewhere else, other voices\r\n           are calling out, \"Here she comes!\"\r\n           And that is dying.\r\n                         \r\n           They raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVERYONE (CONT'D)\r\n           HERE!

HORNS ENTER, droning low, and\r\n           building into an funeral dirge.\r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           When I relax behind my eyes I see\r\n           everything that made me flying\r\n           around in invisible pieces. When I\r\n           look too hard it goes away, but\r\n           when it all goes quiet, I see they\r\n           are right here.\r\n                         \r\n           The Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take\r\n           a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the\r\n           anthem of the Bathtub.\r\n                         \r\n           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)\r\n           I see that I'm a little piece of a\r\n           big, big universe, and that makes\r\n           things right.\r\n                         \r\n           Hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in\r\n           front of an expanse of endless water.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT.
