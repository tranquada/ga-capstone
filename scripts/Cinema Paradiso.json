DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the\n\tshadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the\n\tcity of Giancaldo have been built up.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white\n\twalls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over\n\tsixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n</b>\t\t...Salvatore, that's right, \n\t\tSalvatore.

NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tIt's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.\n\tInside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is\n\tSALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face\n\tcreased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,\n\tsell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a\n\theavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his\n\tcigarette.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the\n\twindow, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full\n\tblast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the\n\tman at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest\n\tfashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated\n\tattention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,\n\tlots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,\n\tprovocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tBOY  \n</b>\t\tHey! What the fuck you looking at!?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tGreen light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for \n\tSALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen \n\tslumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He \n\tmoves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, \n\tfinishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. \n\tA rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n</b>\t\tSalvatore...But what time is it? \n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. \n\tSALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a \n\twhisper.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tIt's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't \n\t\table to let you know I wouldn't be \n\t\tcorning...\n\t\t\t(He fondles her, but he is \n\t\t\ttired, feels like \n\t\t\tsleeping.) \n\t\tGo to sleep now. Sleep.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, \n\tbut whispers.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n</b>\t\tYour mother phoned. She took me for \n\t\tsomebody else...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\t\t(Surprised) \n\t\tAnd what'd you tell her?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n</b>\t\tI played dumb, so as not to \n\t\tdisappoint her. We had a nice little \n\t\ttalk. She says you never go see her, \n\t\tand when she wants to see you she has \n\t\tto come to Rome...Is it true?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question \n\tbefore.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tShe phoned just to say that? \n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n</b>\t\tShe said a certain Alfredo had died. \n\t\tAnd the funeral's taking place \n\t\ttomorrow afternoon...\n\t\t\t(A strange look suddenly \n\t\t\tcomes into SALVATORE'S \n\t\t\teyes. The idea of going to \n\t\t\tsleep has clearly left \n\t\t\thim. It's a piece of news \n\t\t\the didn't expect. That's \n\t\t\ttaken him off-guard. CLARA \n\t\t\twould like to carry on the \n\t\t\tconversation, but \n\t\t\tsleepiness makes \n\t\t\tit almost impossible. An \n\t\t\tshe can manage is one last \n\t\t\tquestion in a faint little \n\t\t\tvoice:)\n\t\tWho is it? A relative of yours?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tNo. Sleep. Go to sleep.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a \n\tsort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, \n\twith its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a \n\theavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the \n\tdark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless \n\tmemories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he \n\tthought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to \n\tlife, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of \n\this face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is \n\tformed, an ancient, remote image...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAn image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of\n\tGiancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he\n\tis kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The\n\tcongregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.\n\tLittle SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns\n\tand doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in\n\tthe air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n</b>\t\tPss! Pssst!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the\n\twithering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and\n\trings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and\n\tthe bell is heard again.\n<b>\t\n</b>\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his\n\tvestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy\n\ttunic.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n</b>\t\tBut how can I make you understand? \n\t\tWithout the bell I just can't go on! \n\t\tAlways half asleep, you are! What do \n\t\tyou do at night anyway? Eat instead \n\t\tof sleep?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tFather, at my house we don't even eat \n\t\tat noon. That's why I'm always \n\t\tsleepy. That's what the vet says.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell\n\tSALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n</b>\t\tAll right, Toto, get moving, I've got \n\t\tthings to do. Say hello to your \n\t\tmother.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tCan I...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n</b>\t\t\t(Interrupting him) \n\t\tAnd don't ask if you can come...\n\t\tBecause you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off \n\t\twith you!!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a\n\tcorridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door\n\tleading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears\n\tinto another door.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main\n\tfloor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of\n\tfilms to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,\n\ta statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has\n\tfinished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of\n\tseats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is\n\tcamouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the\n\tlens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.\n\tthere are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be\n\tmade out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the\n\tprojectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough\n\tpeasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the\n\tcarbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the\n\tholes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his\n\thand.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n</b>\t\tOK, Alfredo, you can start!!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.\n\tUp in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the\n\tprojector going.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tDown in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth\n\tstreams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet\n\tand ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear\n\tthe credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST\n\tscrews up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on\n\tthe arm of his seat.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAt the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,\n\topens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He\n\thas managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a\n\tword, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.\n\tThe credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a\n\tturning-point. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tUp above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,\n\tALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the\n\tPRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the\n\tscreen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in\n\tclose-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,\n\tcarried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty\n\tof the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he\n\tis sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck \n\tcouple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST \n\traises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud \n\tring...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tUp in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been\n\twaiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that\n\tpurpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that\n\tspecific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection\n\tcontinues...\n<b>\t\n</b>\t...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on \n\tthose black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last \n\tdeclaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably \n\tnever seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the \n\tattraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with \n\tthe figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, \n\tvoluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed \n\twonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. \n\tFrom the sound of the bell to another sound...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the \n\tsquare. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A \n\tnoisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. \n\tPeddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the \n\ttown hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema \n\tParadiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been \n\tseen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum \n\tof the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. \n\tThen dead silence. The showing is over.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tDespite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,\n\tcreated by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He\n\tis rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not\n\ttalking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside\n\thim, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\t\t(Harshly, shouting) \n\t\tYou must not come here! How many \n\t\ttimes do I have to tell you?\n\t\t\t(And he slows down the \n\t\t\treels with his hand. The \n\t\t\tslips of paper\n\t\t\tare about to arrive. \n\t\t\tHere's the first.)\n\t\tIf the film catches fire, runt that \n\t\tyou are, you'd go up in a\n\t\tburst of flame...whoosh! And turn \n\t\tinto a piece of...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\t\t(Overlapping him)\n\t\t...and turn into a piece of \n\t\tcharcoal!!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his\n\tgrim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a \n\tslap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\t\t(Angrily) \n\t\tChrist, that's a sassy little tongue \n\t\tyou've got! Watch out, or someday \n\t\tI'll snip it off. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tAnd he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the \n\thandle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees \n\ta series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tCan I have it? \n<b>\t\n</b>\tALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He \n\tshouts.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\tNo!!! Are you deaf or something? I've \n\t\tgot to put this back in when we wind \n\t\tup the film again! You're a real pain \n\t\tin the neck! \n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: \n\tall kisses that have been cut.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tThen why didn't you put these back \n\t\twhen you wound up the films again? \n<b>\t\n</b>\tALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck \n\tin and cuts the scene:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\t'Cause sometimes you can't find the \n\t\tright place any more and so...well, \n\t\tactually...they stay here. \n\t\t\t(Finding an excuse) \n\t\tBesides, there are more kisses than \n\t\tyou can count.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\t\t(Excited) \n\t\tSo I can have these? \n\t\t\t(ALFREDO explodes, flies \n\t\t\toff the handle. He grabs \n\t\t\tSALVATORE by the shoulders \n\t\t\tand shakes him.)\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\tLook, Toto! Before I kick your ass \n\t\tall the way to China and back, let's \n\t\tmake a deal. These strips here are \n\t\tyours, I give them to you. However! \n\t\tOne  you're not to stick your nose in \n\t\there any more. Two  I'll keep them \n\t\tfor you, because you can't take them \n\t\thome for God forbid and save our \n\t\tsouls, if they catch fire, all hell \n\t\twill break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now \n\t\tscram! \n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He \n\treturns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention \n\tis elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, \n\tstuffs them into his pocket and...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tWhat sort of deal is this? The strips \n\t\tare mine! So why can't I come see \n\t\tthem? \n<b>\t\n</b>\tAnd he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, \n\tdarts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He \n\tshrieks:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\tGet out!! And don't show your face \n\t\there again! \n<b>\t\n</b>\tAnd before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off \n\tdown the spiral staircase.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThat was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches\n\tinto a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a\n\tfew frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the\n\tfigures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a\n\twhisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the\n\tmusical climaxes...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tBang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think \n\t\tlater! This is no job for weaklings! \n\t\tTreacherous dog!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's\n\tmother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is\n\tyoung, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by\n\tall the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,\n\this four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The\n\tkerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on\n\tthe wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's\n\tvoice changes, turns even tougher.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE\n</b>\t\tHey there, you lousy bastard, take \n\t\tyour hands off that gold, You black-\n\t\thearted pig, stay away from me, or \n\t\tI'll smash your face in! \n\t\t'Ntantatah!!!...\n\t\t\t(In the heap of movie \n\t\t\tframes there are also \n\t\t\tseveral photographs. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE picks them up. \n\t\t\tFamily keepsakes.

SALVATORE takes a \n\t\t\tcloser look at the man's \n\t\t\tface, then whispers to his \n\t\t\tmother:)\n\t\tMa, if the war's over, how come \n\t\tDaddy's never come back?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n</b>\t\tHe'll be back, he'll be back...\n\t\tYou'll see.

COURTYARD. EXT. DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tA noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue\n\tbows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm\n\ttrees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.\n\tThe Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,\n\tparents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the\n\tpalms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the\n\tkhaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it\n\ton, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying\n\tdesperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags\n\thim along, yelling:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMASINO'S FATHER\n</b>\t\tYou can fool your mother but not me! \n\t\tGet yourself a damn diploma and \n\t\tbecome a policeman.

The TEACHER is standing \n\tthere, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure \n\tmultiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, \n\thas one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' \n\twritten on the blackboard.

He is not in \n\tthe projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of \n\tseats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes \n\tfix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the \n\tprojector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the \n\tcarbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre \n\tand finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n</b>\t\t\t(Sternly) \n\t\tWhat are you doing here? \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tI bought a ticket.

He watches the crazy\n\tdancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a\n\tcone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,\n\temphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,\n\tthat lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. \n\tThe MGM lion.

A different kind of attention \n\ttakes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with \n\topen mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their \n\tprofiles touch.

The road is very wide, covered\n\twith white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession\n\tkicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a\n\tdream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea.

Whispers. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tELENA  \n</b>\t\tSalvatore...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tLoud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as \n\tif in a dream.

For SALVATORE it is an \n\toverwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is \n\tnever-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other \n\tagain. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThey spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the \n\tfirst-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes \n\tlocked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost \n\tclumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling \n\taround and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the \n\tprojector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience \n\twhistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless \n\twhirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he \n\tfeels is the warmth of her \n\tskin.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT.

But what mostly catches his eye is a \n\ttiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling \n\tin front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than \n\the is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time.

It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the \n\tbest years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and \n\tSALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and \n\twindows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds \n\tand mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is \n\tunrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a \n\tsnail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has \n\tturned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small \n\tcrowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at \n\tonce, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the \n\tUSHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, \n\tand further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie \n\thouse and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have \n\trecognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face \n\the seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's \n\tbecome! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. \n\tSALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands \n\theartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\t\t(Under his breath) \n\t\tHow long's it been shut? \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n</b>\t\tSix years ago this May. No one came \n\t\tany more. You \"know better than me, \n\t\tMr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, \n\t\tvideos. By now the movie business is \n\t\tonly a dream. The city's bought it \n\t\tnow to make a new parking lot. Next \n\t\tSaturday they're \n\t\ttearing it down...A pity!...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding \n\tout that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a \n\tpiece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tBut why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? \n\t\tIt didn't used to be that way...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n</b>\t\tWell, it's hard to call an important \n\t\tperson by his first name.

Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. \n\tSALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches \n\thim go, then says, almost to himself) \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n</b>\t\tBless you, Toto. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the \n\tbearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight \n\ton his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An \n\told woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She \n\tcrosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love \n\twith for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the \n\tchurch, followed by the little procession. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT.

The television is on, but the sound has \n\tbeen turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special \n\texcitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they \n\tdon't really know him. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSARA  \n</b>\t\t\t(Playfully) \n\t\tUncle, the next time Granny comes to \n\t\tRome, I want to come along too.

Re peers at LIA eating out \n\tof the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs \n\tand light wrinkles line her face. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThen he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by \n\tcombing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he \n\twonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, \n\tguesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a \n\tblush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.\n\tThe ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA \n\tstops her with a glance of the eye.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n</b>\t\t\t(To SALVATORE) \n\t\tIt must be for you...They've been \n\t\tcalling all afternoon.

The phone goes on ringing.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their\n\tshoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, \n\tkicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he \n\tmakes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a \n\tgray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with \n\tstrange mates of dust, like a haze. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tCobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle \n\taisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has \n\twarped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the \n\talbum of his memories.  \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded \n\tand nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE \n\thas the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . \n\taudience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence \n\treturns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is \n\tattracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, \n\ttakes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with \n\tdust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, \n\trepeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer \n\tthere, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of \n\tthe booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering \n\tas a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks \n\tup a little cloud of dust. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it \n\tlooks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor \n\tthe equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump \n\tof film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One \n\tendings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and\n\tstrips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up\n\tin the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the\n\tnails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films \n\tshown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of \n\tthem are on the floor. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tAnd the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   \n\tbroken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and\n\tsees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer \n\tknows. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t105  CAF\u00c9 IN SQUARE. INT/EXT.

Then SALVATORE turns to \n\tthe plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once \n\twas. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away \n\tfrom \n\thim, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills \n\this blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was \n\tthen! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at \n\tthe station. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her \n\tarm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? \n\tNo! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to \n\texplain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to \n\tthe floor...As the GIRL walks off... \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAt the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering\n\tthe streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old \n\tgirl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of \n\tsomeone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely \n\tshe is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a \n\tdifferent hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. \n\tThe GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her \n\tbooks to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without \n\tstopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tExcuse me, Miss...\n\t\t\t(She turns to look at him, \n\t\t\tindifferent, but friendly. \n\t\t\tHe looks at her wonderful \n\t\t\tblue eyes.) \n\t\tI'm so sorry, I thought you were \n\t\tsomeone else. \n<b>\t\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tGIRL  \n</b>\t\t\t(Shrugging) \n\t\tWell. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe has already started the motor of her bike.

He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  \n\tthe picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't \n\tunderstand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot \n\tyesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the \n\twound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever \n\tknowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his \n\tyoung mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots \n\tslipping again through an old 8mm projector. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tThrough the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE \n\trocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he \n\tcried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks \n\taway without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, \n\tempty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which \n\this camera never set down on film, only his memory. \n<b>\t \n</b><b>\t108  HIGH SCHOOL.

LIA and her family are eating at her \n\thouse today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, \n\tgazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the \n\trolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a \n\theaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face.

At the time I \n\t\tprobably wouldn't have understood, \n\t\tbut I would have later...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, \n\tquiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n</b>\t\tI never had anybody.

He feels \n\trelieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, \n\tbut does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems \n\tto approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of \n\ta car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene \n\ta hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights \n\tmove towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... \n\tThey are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the \n\tperson at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be \n\tbarely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tELENA  \n</b>\t\tSalvatore! \n<b>\t\n</b>\tSALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the \n\tdoor.

Two dark \n\tfigures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to \n\tfurther delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the \n\tothers now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces \n\tof teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a \n\ttruth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but \n\tELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the \n\tendless gaze that envelops them.

They look at each other a little ill at ease, \n\tmaking the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. \n\tSALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined \n\twith wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n</b>\t\tYou're still beautiful...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tELENA  \n</b>\t\tDon't be silly...I'm old.\n\t\t\t(She looks down troubled \n\t\t\tby the way he has of \n\t\t\tgazing into her eyes, \n\t\t\tspeaks almost mumbling her \n\t\t\twords.) \n\t\tDon't look at me like that, please. \n\t\t\t(And she switches off the \n\t\t\tlight.

Only then does he \n\tnotice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more \n\tsheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of \n\tpaper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, \n\tbecause they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film \n\ttitles \n\the recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once \n\tan astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been \n\tturned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He \n\treads it. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSALVATORE'S VOICE  \n</b>\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tSalvatore, forgive me.

A group \n\tof youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, \n\tsmiling...
