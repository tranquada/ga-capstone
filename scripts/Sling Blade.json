She was standing, this girl,\n\t          on the side of the street where\n\t          there was a chicken stand; not the\n\t          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless\n\t          a chicken stand, and I pulled the\n\t          Mercury over and rolled down the\n\t          window by electric power. She was\n\t          wearing a leather skirt and she had\n\t          a lot of hair on her arms. I like\n\t          that. I like it a lot. It means a\n\t          big bush. I like a big bush. She\n\t          said, \"Are you dating?\" I said,\n\t          \"yes,\" and she got in the car. We\n\t          pulled to a remote location, one\n\t          that she and I both felt\n\t          comfortable with and she said, \"How\n\t          much can you spend?\" I said, \"What\n\t          it takes to see your bush. I know\n\t          it's a big one.\" She said \"twenty\n\t          five dollars,\" which to a working\n\t          man is not chicken feed. I produced\n\t          the money and she put it in her\n\t          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There\n\t          before me lay a thin, crooked,\n\t          uncircumcised penis.

His voice is low and raspy, but\n\tnot just low and raspy; strange.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    KARL \n</b>\t          Well, I reckon what you're a\n\t          wanting to know is what I'm doing\n\t          in here. I reckon the reason I'm in\n\t          here is 'cause I killed somebody.\n\t          But I reckon what you was a wanting\n\t          to know is how come me to kill\n\t          somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start\n\t          at the front and tell you. \n\t              (pause, heavy breathing)\n\t          I lived most of my life out behind\n\t          my mother and father's house in a\n\t          little old shed and my daddy'd\n\t          built for me. They didn't too much\n\t          want me up there in the house with\n\t          the rest of 'em. I mostly just set\n\t          around out there in the shed all\n\t          the time a lookin' at the ground.\n\t          It didn't have no floor but I had\n\t          me a hole dug out to lay down in\n\t          and a quilt or tow that I put down\n\t          there. \n\t              (pause, more breathing)\n\t          My daddy was a hard workin' man\n\t          most of his life, not that I can\n\t          say the same fer myself. I most\n\t          just set around the shed and\n\t          tinkered around with a lawn mower\n\t          or two and went to school off and\n\t          on from time to time but the\n\t          children there made quite a bit of\n\t          sport of me, made fun of me quite a\n\t          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up\n\t          sometimes so mostly I stayed out\n\t          back there in the shed. My daddy\n\t          worked down at the sawmill there,\n\t          down there at the planer mill for\n\t          an old man named Dixon.\n\t          Old man Dixon was a very cruel\n\t          feller, he didn't treat his\n\t          employees very well, didn't pay 'em\n\t          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy\n\t          much of a wage, just barely enough\n\t          to get by on. But I reckon he got\n\t          by all right, they come out one or\n\t          the other of 'em, usually my\n\t          mother, and fed me pretty regular.\n\t          At least I know he made enough for\n\t          me to have mustard and biscuits\n\t          three or four times a week. Old man\n\t          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.\n\t          Jesse was really more cruel than\n\t          his daddy. He made quite a bit of\n\t          sport of me and takened advantage\n\t          of the little girls around the\n\t          neighborhood quite a bit. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          He used to say my mother was a very\n\t          pretty woman. He said it quite a\n\t          bit from time to time, when I was\n\t          at the school house. Well, I reckon\n\t          you want me to get on and tell you\n\t          what happened so I reckon I'll tell\n\t          you. I was settin' out in the shed\n\t          one evenin' not doin' too much,\n\t          just kindly starin' at the wall and\n\t          a waitin' fer my mother to come out\n\t          and give me my Bible lesson and I\n\t          heared a commotion up in the house\n\t          there so I got up and run up on the\n\t          screened-in porch there to see what\n\t          was a goin' on, and I looked in the\n\t          kitchen window and I seen my mother\n\t          a layin' there on the floor without\n\t          any clothes on. \n\t              (pause, breathing)\n\t          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on\n\t          top of her having his way with her. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          Well, I just seen red. I picked up\n\t          a kaiser blade that was a layin'\n\t          there by the screen door, some\n\t          folks calls it a sling blade, I\n\t          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a\n\t          long handle like a axe handle with\n\t          a long blade on it that's shaped\n\t          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one\n\t          edge and dull on the other. It's\n\t          what the highway boys use to cut\n\t          down weeds and whatnot.\n\t          I went in the kitchen there and I\n\t          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head\n\t          with it and knocked him off my\n\t          mother. I reckon that didn't quite\n\t          satisfy me so I hit him again in\n\t          the neck with the sharp edge and\n\t          just plumb near cut his head off.\n\t          Killed him. Well, my mother, she\n\t          jumped up from there and started\n\t          yellin', \"What did you kill Jesse\n\t          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?\"\n\t              (pause, intense breathing)\n\t          Well, come to find out my mother\n\t          didn't really mind what Jesse was a\n\t          doin' to her. I reckon that made me\n\t          madder than what Jesse had made me.\n\t          I takened the kaiser blade, some\n\t          folks calls it a sling blade, I\n\t          call it a kaiser blade and hit my\n\t          mother up side the head with it an'\n\t          killed her.\n\t              (long pause, breathing)\n\t          Some folks has asked me if I had it\n\t          to do over again would I do the\n\t          same thing. I don't know, I reckon\n\t          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to\n\t          put me in here and here I've been\n\t          for a great long while. I've\n\t          learned to read some; took me four\n\t          years to read the Bible. I reckon I\n\t          understand a good deal of it. It\n\t          wasn't what I expected in a lot of\n\t          places. I've slept in a good bed\n\t          for a great long while. They've\n\t          seen fit to put me out now. They\n\t          tell me they're a settin' me free\n\t          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all\n\t          you need to know. If you want any\n\t          more details I reckon I can tell\n\t          'em to you.

Anyway,\n\t          I'm rambling. If you're going to\n\t          live in the Wheatly garage you need\n\t          to know that it won't be easy.\n\t          Doyle is a monster. Not just a\n\t          closed minded redneck, but a\n\t          monster. A dangerous person. I've\n\t          told Linda that one day that man is\n\t          going to really hurt her or that\n\t          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I\n\t          see it in his eyes. I'm very in\n\t          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle\n\t          will make your life hell. You're a\n\t          perfect target. When I first saw\n\t          you I was afraid of you. Not really\n\t          afraid, I guess, just taken aback.\n\t          But also, I felt a real sensitive\n\t          feeling from you. And for some\n\t          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much\n\t          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I\n\t          didn't mean it like that. In a good\n\t          way. Anyway, I just want you to\n\t          know what you're in for. I have a\n\t          good feeling about you. You're good\n\t          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can\n\t          have an adult friend on a child's\n\t          level.\n\t          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a\n\t          bad way.\n\t              (pause)\n\t          There's one more thing.
