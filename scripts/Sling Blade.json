A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY\n\t\n\tA few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man\n\tsits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper\n\twith a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette\n\tand staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,\n\tKARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his\n\thands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring\n\tand Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant\n\tapproaches Charles.\n\t\n\t                    ATTENDANT \n\t          You can't smoke in here.\n\t\n\tCharles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues\n\tsmoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then\n\tlooks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.\n\t\n\t                    CHARLES \n\t          A Mercury is a good car and that's\n\t          what I was driving that day. I've\n\t          owned a lot of cars. Different\n\t          kinds. Lots of different kinds of\n\t          cars. She was standing, this girl,\n\t          on the side of the street where\n\t          there was a chicken stand; not the\n\t          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless\n\t          a chicken stand, and I pulled the\n\t          Mercury over and rolled down the\n\t          window by electric power. She was\n\t          wearing a leather skirt and she had\n\t          a lot of hair on her arms. I like\n\t          that. I like it a lot. It means a\n\t          big bush. I like a big bush. She\n\t          said, \"Are you dating?\" I said,\n\t          \"yes,\" and she got in the car. We\n\t          pulled to a remote location, one\n\t          that she and I both felt\n\t          comfortable with and she said, \"How\n\t          much can you spend?\" I said, \"What\n\t          it takes to see your bush. I know\n\t          it's a big one.\" She said \"twenty\n\t          five dollars,\" which to a working\n\t          man is not chicken feed. I produced\n\t          the money and she put it in her\n\t          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There\n\t          before me lay a thin, crooked,\n\t          uncircumcised penis. You can\n\t          imagine how badly I wanted my\n\t          twenty-five dollars back.\n\t\n\tINT.

I told your sponsor\n\t          or teacher or whatever he is, there\n\t          couldn't be any pictures. It's\n\t          s'posed to be just a little story\n\t          or article or something, isn't that\n\t          right?\n\t\n\t                    MARSHA\n\t          Well, yeah, it's for the school\n\t          newspaper. But it has pictures.

Karl\n\t          won't talk to women.\n\t\n\tINT. REC ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tCLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another\n\tmonologue.\n\t\n\t                    CHARLES \n\t          There was a young man named John\n\t          Liggit Hunter who was in the\n\t          filling station business and a good\n\t          filling station business. He was\n\t          one of those young men that we run\n\t          across so often in life. I'm sure\n\t          you've run across them, that didn't\n\t          deserve the things he had. One of\n\t          those things was his beautiful\n\t          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia\n\t          Peach. As a matter of fact she\n\t          looked more like the picture I've\n\t          had in my head than any woman I've\n\t          ever seen. I took it upon myself to\n\t          take her away from John Liggit\n\t          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm\n\t          not sure if I mentioned that he was\n\t          a Frenchman who claimed to be an\n\t          Englishman. It took some very\n\t          strong nylon cord to take her away\n\t          from him. She was a fighter as well\n\t          as a Georgia Peach.\n\t\n\tINT.

I made myself pretty clear I\n\t          thought. He probably got busy and\n\t          wasn't thinking. I know how that\n\t          is. I used to teach shop and eighth\n\t          grade science.\n\t\n\t                    MARSHA \n\t          Well, what do we do?

You know. With all\n\t          that. He won't hardly talk to\n\t          anybody really. Just certain\n\t          people. He's very troubled.\n\t\n\tINT.

That's why I\n\t          said to send a man. At least maybe\n\t          he'd answer a question or two for a\n\t          man. I'm all for helping the\n\t          college out, believe me.

He couldn't really read\n\t          but, well, neither could his\n\t          mother. But, his father made sure\n\t          that his mother knew what the Bible\n\t          said. And she made sure Karl knew.\n\t          You know he slept in a hole in the\n\t          ground under a toolshed, right?\n\t\n\t                    MARSHA \n\t          I knew he slept in a toolshed.\n\t\n\t                    WOOLRIDGE\n\t          His mother told him that he was\n\t          their punishment.

Just period, I\n\t          think. She told him... God gave\n\t          them the ugliest creation he could\n\t          think of. Karl has an entire book --\n\t          a notebook. On every page it says\n\t          \"Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number\n\t          1.\" He wrote that a few years ago\n\t          after he'd learned to write.

I mostly just set\n\t          around out there in the shed all\n\t          the time a lookin' at the ground.\n\t          It didn't have no floor but I had\n\t          me a hole dug out to lay down in\n\t          and a quilt or tow that I put down\n\t          there. \n\t              (pause, more breathing)\n\t          My daddy was a hard workin' man\n\t          most of his life, not that I can\n\t          say the same fer myself. I most\n\t          just set around the shed and\n\t          tinkered around with a lawn mower\n\t          or two and went to school off and\n\t          on from time to time but the\n\t          children there made quite a bit of\n\t          sport of me, made fun of me quite a\n\t          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up\n\t          sometimes so mostly I stayed out\n\t          back there in the shed. My daddy\n\t          worked down at the sawmill there,\n\t          down there at the planer mill for\n\t          an old man named Dixon.\n\t          Old man Dixon was a very cruel\n\t          feller, he didn't treat his\n\t          employees very well, didn't pay 'em\n\t          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy\n\t          much of a wage, just barely enough\n\t          to get by on. But I reckon he got\n\t          by all right, they come out one or\n\t          the other of 'em, usually my\n\t          mother, and fed me pretty regular.\n\t          At least I know he made enough for\n\t          me to have mustard and biscuits\n\t          three or four times a week. Old man\n\t          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.\n\t          Jesse was really more cruel than\n\t          his daddy. He made quite a bit of\n\t          sport of me and takened advantage\n\t          of the little girls around the\n\t          neighborhood quite a bit. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          He used to say my mother was a very\n\t          pretty woman. He said it quite a\n\t          bit from time to time, when I was\n\t          at the school house. Well, I reckon\n\t          you want me to get on and tell you\n\t          what happened so I reckon I'll tell\n\t          you. I was settin' out in the shed\n\t          one evenin' not doin' too much,\n\t          just kindly starin' at the wall and\n\t          a waitin' fer my mother to come out\n\t          and give me my Bible lesson and I\n\t          heared a commotion up in the house\n\t          there so I got up and run up on the\n\t          screened-in porch there to see what\n\t          was a goin' on, and I looked in the\n\t          kitchen window and I seen my mother\n\t          a layin' there on the floor without\n\t          any clothes on. \n\t              (pause, breathing)\n\t          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on\n\t          top of her having his way with her. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          Well, I just seen red. I picked up\n\t          a kaiser blade that was a layin'\n\t          there by the screen door, some\n\t          folks calls it a sling blade, I\n\t          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a\n\t          long handle like a axe handle with\n\t          a long blade on it that's shaped\n\t          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one\n\t          edge and dull on the other. It's\n\t          what the highway boys use to cut\n\t          down weeds and whatnot.\n\t          I went in the kitchen there and I\n\t          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head\n\t          with it and knocked him off my\n\t          mother. I reckon that didn't quite\n\t          satisfy me so I hit him again in\n\t          the neck with the sharp edge and\n\t          just plumb near cut his head off.\n\t          Killed him. Well, my mother, she\n\t          jumped up from there and started\n\t          yellin', \"What did you kill Jesse\n\t          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?\"\n\t              (pause, intense breathing)\n\t          Well, come to find out my mother\n\t          didn't really mind what Jesse was a\n\t          doin' to her. I reckon that made me\n\t          madder than what Jesse had made me.\n\t          I takened the kaiser blade, some\n\t          folks calls it a sling blade, I\n\t          call it a kaiser blade and hit my\n\t          mother up side the head with it an'\n\t          killed her.\n\t              (long pause, breathing)\n\t          Some folks has asked me if I had it\n\t          to do over again would I do the\n\t          same thing. I don't know, I reckon\n\t          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to\n\t          put me in here and here I've been\n\t          for a great long while. I've\n\t          learned to read some; took me four\n\t          years to read the Bible. I reckon I\n\t          understand a good deal of it. It\n\t          wasn't what I expected in a lot of\n\t          places. I've slept in a good bed\n\t          for a great long while. They've\n\t          seen fit to put me out now. They\n\t          tell me they're a settin' me free\n\t          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all\n\t          you need to know. If you want any\n\t          more details I reckon I can tell\n\t          'em to you. I don't know if that's\n\t          enough for your newspaper or not.\n\t\n\tSuddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.\n\t\n\t                    MARSHA \n\t          Will you ever kill anybody again,\n\t          Karl?\n\t\n\tThis seems to startle the very room itself.

LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her\n\tthirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,\n\twith a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging\n\tover his belt.

He likes\n\t          to go with men instead of women.\n\t          That makes him not to be able to\n\t          fight too good. He sure is nice\n\t          though. He's from St. Louis. People\n\t          who are queer can get along better\n\t          in a big town. He got transferred\n\t          here to work.

HAMBURGER ESTABLISHMENT - DAY\n\t\n\tVaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a\n\ttable and they sit and immediately start to eat.

Where do I start. Linda\n\t          and Frank are very important to me.\n\t          They're like family. My own family\n\t          was never like family. They're\n\t          horrible people. As a matter of\n\t          fact I prayed every night for years\n\t          that my father would die. I finally\n\t          realized through a lot of therapy\n\t          that I was wasting my energy on\n\t          hating him. Now I just don't care. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          You see, you and I are a lot alike,\n\t          strange as that may seem. I mean\n\t          not physically or even mentally\n\t          really, just well, maybe\n\t          emotionally or actually the hand\n\t          we've been dealt in life. We're\n\t          different. People see us as being\n\t          different anyway. You're -- well\n\t          you have your affliction or\n\t          whatever and I, well mine's not as\n\t          easy to see. I'm just going to say\n\t          it. I'm gay. \n\t              (watts)\n\t          Does that surprise you? \n\t              (watts)\n\t          That I'm gay.

Sexually.\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.\n\t\n\t                    VAUGHAN \n\t          Well that's a very offensive way to\n\t          put it. You shouldn't say that. You\n\t          were taught that, weren't you?\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          I've heard it said that way.\n\t\n\t                    VAUGHAN \n\t          Anyway, it's hard to live gay,\n\t          that's the right way to say it, in\n\t          a small town like this. I've wanted\n\t          to leave many times, but my love\n\t          for Linda and Frank and another\n\t          certain person that we won't go\n\t          into have kept me from it. Anyway,\n\t          I'm rambling. If you're going to\n\t          live in the Wheatly garage you need\n\t          to know that it won't be easy.\n\t          Doyle is a monster. Not just a\n\t          closed minded redneck, but a\n\t          monster. A dangerous person. I've\n\t          told Linda that one day that man is\n\t          going to really hurt her or that\n\t          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I\n\t          see it in his eyes. I'm very in\n\t          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle\n\t          will make your life hell. You're a\n\t          perfect target. When I first saw\n\t          you I was afraid of you. Not really\n\t          afraid, I guess, just taken aback.\n\t          But also, I felt a real sensitive\n\t          feeling from you. And for some\n\t          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much\n\t          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I\n\t          didn't mean it like that. In a good\n\t          way. Anyway, I just want you to\n\t          know what you're in for. I have a\n\t          good feeling about you. You're good\n\t          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can\n\t          have an adult friend on a child's\n\t          level.\n\t          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a\n\t          bad way.\n\t              (pause)\n\t          There's one more thing. It's none\n\t          of my business why you were in the\n\t          state hospital. Everyone has\n\t          something in their past, maybe you\n\t          tried suicide, maybe you did\n\t          something -- terrible. But what I\n\t          see before me is a gentle, simple\n\t          man. All I want you to promise me\n\t          is that you're capable of being\n\t          around Linda and Frank. You know.\n\t          You would never hurt them under any\n\t          circumstances, would you?\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          I wouldn't never hurt them.\n\t\n\t                    VAUGHAN \n\t          That's what I thought. I hope I\n\t          haven't offended you in any way.\n\t          You seem like a thinker. You seem\n\t          to always be in deep thought. Tell\n\t          me something. What are you thinking\n\t          right now?\n\t\n\tKarl looks up and stares for a moment.\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          I was thinkin' I could use me\n\t          another helpin' of these potaters.\n\t\n\t                    VAUGHAN \n\t          Oh. How about before that?\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          Before that I was thinkin' it'd be\n\t          good if I could get another three\n\t          or four cans of that potted meat if\n\t          you got any extry.\n\t\n\tINT.

JUNIOR HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY\n\t\n\tIt's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl,\n\tFrank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up.\n\tFour boys are lined on defense.

All the others\n\tare chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on\n\tabout the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl\n\tsees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the\n\tball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end\n\tzone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other\n\tboys.

It is just a\n\tfolded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be\n\thappy.'

I swear to God you're the\n\t          weirdest son of a bitch I ever\n\t          heard of.\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t          I aim to kill you with it.\n\t\n\tDoyle keeps drinking and watching TV.\n\t\n\t                    DOYLE \n\t          Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police\n\t          you push 911. You'll need to tell\n\t          'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a\n\t          hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're\n\t          gonna kill me. \n\t              (laughs)\n\t\n\tKarl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We\n\tsee the flickering light of the TV on the wall.

Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to\n\tthe kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it\n\tfor a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood\n\ton his face, hand and shirt.\n\t\n\t                    KARL \n\t              (into phone)\n\t          Yes ma'am.

I\n\t          hit him two good whacks. That\n\t          second time just plumb near cut his\n\t          head in two. \n\t              (pause)\n\t          Hits a little old yeller house\n\t          right on the corner of Marigold\n\t          Street and some other street.\n\t          They's a red pickup truck out front\n\t          says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION\n\t          on it. I'll be a settin' here\n\t          waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the\n\t          police, Doyle said you might want\n\t          to send a ambulance or a hearse.\n\t          Thank ye.\n\t\n\tHe hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar\n\tof mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the\n\tkitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering\n\tup some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the\n\tmustard jar and runs the knife around it.\n\tThere's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the\n\tbiscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.\n\t\n\t                                        CUT TO:\n\t\n\tCLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE\n\t\n\tHe's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull\n\tback and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital\n\tagain with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles.

I got all\n\t          the right spots. She was the first\n\t          one I ever kept for any length of\n\t          time, you see I get bored easily, I\n\t          have a short attention span. I\n\t          can't say she enjoyed her stay,\n\t          although the washcloth in her mouth\n\t          held in place by good duct tape\n\t          kept any complaints to a minimum. I\n\t          don't really like people who talk a\n\t          lot. I like to do the talking. I\n\t          guess that's why I'm so fond of\n\t          you. You're so easygoing, although\n\t          I do sense a little tension in you\n\t          sometimes. By the way, how was it\n\t          out there?
