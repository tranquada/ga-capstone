One disembodied skate rolls across the room.\n\nSc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7\n\nThe woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears \nluminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, \nthe objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands \nunconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves \nto a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she \nbegins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, \nunaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie \naccompaniment to the music.\n\nAn old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. \nThe emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.\n\n                    CUT TO BLACK\n\nSc 8     EXT     UNDERWATER BEACH          DAY     Sc 8\n\nUnder water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the \nsurface.\n\nSc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9\n\nAmidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the \nshoulders of five seamen. Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the \nmen's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her \npad and pen. We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial \noffering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited. A \nblack sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush.\n\nThe breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, \ncalling to each other.\n\n                         SEAMEN\n               Hold still you smutt!

She \ntoo is carried on the shoulders of seamen.\n\nADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the \nwet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of \nher. The sound of sea behind is thunderous.\n\nSeveral of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand.\n\n\nHer daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention \nis diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a \nhuge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore \nbut ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher \nsafer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, \none hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free \nhand.\n\nSc 10     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 10\n\nTWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes \nincluding an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the \nshore.\n\nThe SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look \nbetween ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the \nmen approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or \ndown on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the \nwomen alone on this beach is too hopeless.\n\n                         SEAMEN\n               It's a little rough out there. \n               Could be they can't get through \n               to you in this weather.

The little girl speaks clearly and loudly \nwithout emotion.\n\n                         FLORA\n               She says, \"thank you\".\n\nPuzzled, the man walks off, then turns and comes back.\n\n                         SEAMEN\n               Does your mother prefer to come \n               on with us to Nelson?\n\nADA signs vigorously to FLORA.\n\n                         FLORA\n               She says, No. She says she'd \n               rather be boiled alive by \n               natives than get back in your \n               tub.\n\n                         SEAMEN\n               (stunned) You be damn fortuned \n               I don't smack your puppy gob, \n               missy.

The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to \nexaggerate their isolation and hopelessness.\n\n2- See notes\n\nSuddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of \nthe piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet. \nShe is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed.\n\nThey watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has \nescaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.\n\nSCENE 13 DELETED\n\nSc 14     EXT     BEACH                         DUSK     Sc 14\n\nThere is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter \ninside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges \nwith stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation.\n\nADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous \nand afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the \"telling\", her face is \nalight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, \nwhile her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is \nan odd shadow play.\n\n                         FLORA\n               (hand signaling) Mother...

The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such \nthat the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the \nMAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a \nmixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small \nand has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his \ncheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy \nand out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then \nslows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the \ngreen foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows.\n\n                         BAINES\n               Are we stopping?... Do you want \n               to stop?\n\nThe MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter.

Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and \nover a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us \nto see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he \nsecretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on \nahead possessed and determined.\n\n                         STEWART\n               We must get on.\n\nThe MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered.\n\n                         TAME\n               Aue tepatupsiarehe!\n               (The fairy people, what can you \n               expect?) \n                         SUBTITLED\n\nSc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16\n\nIt is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The \nparty or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to \nthe beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline \nwhere an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of \ncontainers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their \narms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART \nautomatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, \nwhere it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a \nformal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The \nparty stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its \noccupants.\n\n                         STEWART\n               Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. \n               You'll have to wake yourself. \n               I've got men here to carry your \n               things.\n\nADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of \nmen and women.

He stops smiling, and, patting \nhis hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow \nbehind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him.\n\n\n                         STEWART\n               What's in here?\n\nADA points to the writing already on the box saying \"Crockery and \nPots\".\n\n                         STEWART\n               Ohh, yes so it is, written \n               there, crockery.\n\n                         STEWART\n               And this one?\n\nADA writes \"bedclothes and linen\" on the pad around her neck- While \nshe writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her.\n\n                         STEWART\n               You're small.

The MAORI mimic also pretends to write.\n\nFinally he comes to the piano box.

Aren't you \n               going to play something?\nADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her \nhands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over \nher left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she \nremoves her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly \ntakes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her \nhappiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.\n\n                         FLORA\nWhat will I play?\n\nShe looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating.\n\n                         STEWART\nPlay a gig.\n\n                         FLORA\n(to ADA) Do I know any gigs?\n\n                         STEWART\nPlay a song then\n\nFLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART \nignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through \nthe hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. \nSTEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing \nwith a sudden outburst.\n\n                         STEWART\n(exasperated) Why won't she \nplay it?

She stops. Her head \nstiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. \nShe peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. \nShe thinks and walks on.\n\nSc 88     INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 88\n\nThe next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A \nslit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut \nwood. ADA's expression is critical and distant.\n\nTaking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger \nholds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its \nside, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at \nthe piano to begin playing.\n\nShe starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long \nshe is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she \n'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But \nonce more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she \npauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks \naway. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand \non the lid and one on the piano keys.\n\nSc 89     EXT     PATH TO BAINES'     DAY     Sc 89\n\nADA carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path \nto BAINES' hut, FLORA has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back.

FLORA walks back through the bush \nmuttering childish expletives to herself. STEWART and his two MAORI \nhelpers come out of the bush towards her. FLORA squeals with fright.\n\n                         STEWART\n(looking up the hill) Where's \nyour mother?

Go NOW! Leave!\n\nADA is stung by his change of tune, she takes a step towards him and \neyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face. \nBAINES' nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she \nhas spoken words of love. ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each \nother at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, \nprofoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their \neyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and \nreconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how \nthey came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other \nand beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. \nThere is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings \nand emotions guide their instincts. BAINES' face crumples with the \nexquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest. \nBAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.\n\nSc 91     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT          DAY     Sc 91\n\nOutside STEWART surveys the hut suspiciously. BAINES' dog growls as he \nclimbs on to the small verandah. Carefully STEWART peers through some \nloosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying \nhim. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see \nADA and BAINES kissing, undressing\n\nHe reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, \nhe steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for \ncuriosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons \nburst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he \ntakes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART \nwatches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's \nskirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly \nhe pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes \nit on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised.\n\nSc 92     INT     BAINES' BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 92\n\nInside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the \nsoftness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black \nstrands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her \nface is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across \nher chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly \nthey continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low \nmurmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose \nface swoons with joy.\n\n                         BAINES\n               What?

Will you come \n               again?\n\nADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at \nthe time past, worried to dress and return.\n\nThe camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose \nwooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching \nfor each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to \nSTEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls \nout.\n\n                         BAINES\n               Wait! I don't know what you're \n               thinking.

Ada, do you love me?\n\nADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is \nmore complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she \nkisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA \nfinishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the \nbuttons.\n\n                         BAINES\n               (anxiously) Come tomorrow. If \n               you are serious, come tomorrow.\n\nADA turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of \nsomeone who has just discovered their appetite for sex.

The look on his face is \nunlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, \nbut all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes \nand calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her \narm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest \nkisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps \nback staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on \ntop of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over \nhand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting \nher dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws \nSTEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART \ncatches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and \nkissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it.

She strokes so \nsoftly, the tenderness is shocking to him. Gently she pulls his under-\ngarment down, exposing his buttocks. STEWART grabs nervously at them, \nhauling them up with his hands. ADA unclenches his fist and once more, \nslowly pulls them down. She begins to stroke his buttocks, STEWART is \npainfully eroticised, painfully vulnerable, he begins to weep, the \nintimacy and soft-ness unman him and he is helpless.

She looks back moved by his \nhelplessness, but distanced as if it has nothing to do with her.\n\n               Do you?\n\nADA does not respond. STEWART slumps into disappointment and despair.\n\n               Why?

FLORA preens a miniature landscape of moss and tiny branches \nall piled on a dinner plate. A slit of sunlight falling across the top \nsmall branches gives it a magical glow.

He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, \nunconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all \nhis control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He \nbrings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A \nnew thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased \nthe thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face \nstill fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo \nhis belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As \nhe moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and \nhorror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, \nperfectly focused.

As \nhe watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and \nhis eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own.\n\nThe kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across \ntheir faces.

She \nputs her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth.\n\nThe piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the \npiano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it. \nADA watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal \ncuriosity, odd and undisciplined, she steps into a loop.\n\nThe rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the \nsea, and pulled by the piano down through the cold water.\n\nSc 146INT     SEA NEAR BEACH     DAY     Sc 146\n\nBubbles tumble from her mouth. Down she falls, on and on. her eyes are \nopen, her clothes twisting about her. The MAORIS diving after her \ncannot reach her in these depths. ADA begins to struggle. She kicks at \nthe rope, but it holds tight around her boot. She kicks hard again and \nthen with her other foot, levers herself free from her shoe. The piano \nand her shoe continue their fall while ADA floats above, suspended in \nthe deep water, then suddenly her body awakes and fights, struggling \nupwards to the surface.\n\nSc 147 EXT     AT SEA BEACH     DAY     Sc 147\n\nAs ADA breaks the surface her VOICE OVER begins:\n\n                         ADA (VOICE OVER)\n               What a death!\n               What a chance!\n               What a surprise!\n               My will has chosen life!?\n               Still it has had me spooked and \n               many others besides!\n\nADA coughing and spluttering is pulled on to the canoe.
