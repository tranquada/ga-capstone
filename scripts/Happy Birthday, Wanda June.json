Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the\ndarkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting.\nA SINGER is heard singing the first bars of \"All God's\nChillun Got Shoes.\"  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY\nstand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They\nare motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening\nmaterializes outside the windows.\n\nThe lights come up on the living room of a rich man's\napartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts\nand wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master\nbedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the\nkitchen and so on.\n\n                         PENELOPE\n            How do you do.  My name is Penelope\n            Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play\n            about men who enjoy killing--and\n            those who don't.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I\n            have killed perhaps two hundred men\n            in wars of various sorts--as a\n            professional soldier.  I have\n            killed thousands of other animals\n            as well--for sport.\n\n                         WOODLY\n            I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a\n            physician, a healer.  I find it\n            disgusting and frightening that a\n            killer should be a respected member\n            of society.  Gentleness must\n            replace violence everywhere, or we\n            are doomed.\n\n                         PENELOPE\n                   (to LOOSELEAF)\n            Would you like to say something\n            about killing, Colonel?\n\n                         LOOSELEAF\n                   (embarrassed)\n            Jesus--I dunno.

He\n            disappeared in a light plane over\n            the Amazon Rain Forest, where he\n            hoped to find diamonds as big as\n            cantaloupes.  His pilot was Colonel\n            Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the\n            bomb on Nagasaki.\n                   (hyena laughs)\n            I should explain the doorbells in\n            this apartment.  They were built by\n            Abercrombie and Fitch.  They are\n            actual recordings of animal cries.\n            The back doorbell is a hyena, which\n            you've just heard.

Today was\n            going to be my birthday, but I was\n            hit by an ice-cream truck before I\n            could have my party.  I am dead now.\n            I am in Heaven.  That is why my\n            parents did not pick up the cake at\n            the bakery.  I am not mad at the\n            ice-cream truck driver, even though\n            he was drunk when he hit me.  It didn't\n            hurt much.  It wasn't even as bad as the\n            sting of a bumblebee.  I am really\n            happy here!  It's so much fun.  I\n            am glad the driver was drunk.  If\n            he hadn't been, I might not have\n            got to Heaven for years and years\n            and years.  I would have had to go\n            to high school first, and then\n            beauty college.  I would have had\n            to get married and have babies and\n            everything.  Now I can just play\n            and play and play.  Any time I want\n            any pink cotton candy I can have\n            some.  Everybody up here is happy--\n            the animals and the dead soldiers\n            and people who went to the electric\n            chair and everything.  They're all\n            glad for whatever sent them here.\n            Nobody is mad.  We're all too busy\n            playing shuffleboard.  So if you\n            think of killing somebody, don't\n            worry about it.  Just go ahead and\n            do it.  Whoever you do it to should\n            kiss you for doing it.  The\n            soldiers up here just love the\n            shrapnel and the tanks and the\n            bayonets and the dum dums that let\n            them play shuffleboard all the\n            time--and drink beer.\n\nSpotlight begins to dim and carnival music on a steam\ncalliope begins to intrude, until, at the end of the speech,\nWANDA JUNE is drowned out and the stage is black.\n\n                         WANDA JUNE\n            We have merry-go-rounds that don't\n            cost anything to ride on.  We have\n            Ferris wheels.  We have Little\n            League and girls' basketball.\n            There's a drum and bugle corps\n            anybody can join.  For people who\n            like golf, there is a par-three\n            golf course and a driving range,\n            with never any waiting.  If you\n            just want to sit and loaf, why\n            that's all right, too.  Gourmet\n            specialties are cooked to your\n            order and served at any time of\n            night or day...\n\nSudden silence.\n\n                         WOODY WOODPECKER VOICE\n            Ha ha ha ha ha!\n                   (pistol shot)\n            You got me, pal.\n\nSilence.\n\nSpotlight comes up on LOOSELEAF HARPER, who wears the\nclothes he will wear in the next scene--new sports clothes,\na shirt open at the neck.  As always, he is friendly and\nembarrassed.\n\n                         LOOSELEAF\n            When Penelope asked me to say\n            something about dropping the bomb\n            on Nagasaki, I didn't give a very\n            good answer, I guess.  It's a very\n            complicated question.  Jesus--you\n            know?  You have to explain what\n            it's like to be in the Air Force\n            and how they give you your orders\n            and all that.  What it feels like\n            to be in a plane, what the world\n            looks like down there.  After I got\n            home from the war, the minister of\n            my church asked me if I would speak\n            to a scout troop that met in the\n            church basement.  So I did.  They\n            met on Thursday nights.  I used to\n            belong to that troop.  I never made\n            Eagle Scout.  But you know\n            something?  It's a very strange\n            kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout.\n            They always seem so lonesome, like\n            they'd worked real hard to get a\n            job nobody else cares about.  They\n            get a whole bunch of merit badges.\n            That's how you get to be an Eagle\n            Scout.  I don't think I had over\n            five or six merit badges.  The only\n            one I remember is Public Health.\n            That was a bitch.  The Boy Scout\n            Manual said I was supposed to find\n            out what my town did about sewage.\n            Jesus, they just dumped it all in\n            Sugar Creek.\n                   (laughs idiotically)\n            Sugar Creek!  That was a long time\n            ago, but it's all coming back to me\n            now.  There was another merit badge\n            you could get for roller skating.\n            There used to be a roller rink at a\n            bend in Sugar Creek, up above where\n            the sewage went in.  I got in a\n            fight there one time.  I had on\n            roller skates, and the guy I was\n            fighting had on basketball shoes.\n            He had a tremendous advantage over\n            me.  He was a little guy, but he\n            beat the shit out of me.  I had to\n            laugh like hell.  Don't ever fight\n            a guy when you've got on roller\n            skates.\n                   (silence)\n            Jesus--I remember my mother used to\n            make me chew bananas for a full\n            minute before I swallowed--so I\n            wouldn't get sick.  Makes you\n            wonder what else your parents told\n            you that wasn't true.\n\nBlackout.\n\nSCENE FIVE\n\nSPOTLIGHT comes up on HAROLD.  He sits on the front seat of\nan imaginary car.  The seat is covered with zebra skin.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            The night I met Penelope, I had no\n            beard--so imagine me, if you can,\n            without a beard.  Actually, I\n            wasn't as good-looking then as I am\n            now.  And, if anything, me health\n            has improved.  At any rate--I had\n            just come home from Kenya--to\n            discover that my third wife,\n            Mildred, like the two before her,\n            had become a drunken bum.  In my\n            experience, alcoholism is far more\n            prevalent among women than men.  So\n            I got into my automobile--\n\nHe pantomimes turning the ignition key.  The sound of a\nstarter and a powerful engine responds.  He pantomimes\nputting the car in gear and driving away from the curb.\nAppropriate sounds are heard.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            I drive through the night, until I\n            was attracted by a sign which said--\n\nSpotlight comes up on PENELOPE, who wears a skimpy carhop\noutfit she has had on under her coat in the previous scene.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            \"Hamburger Heaven.\"\n\n                         PENELOPE\n            Heaven.\n\nHAROLD pantomimes swerving into Hamburger Heaven.

There was only one\n            thing he enjoyed more than watching\n            someone make that choice, and that\n            was making the choice himself.  Ask\n            about Spain, where he was the\n            youngest soldier in the Abraham\n            Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous\n            sniper.

At\n            sunset one day, your father and I,\n            peering through field glasses, saw\n            a black Mercedes draw up to a\n            village inn.  It was escorted by\n            two motorcyclists and an armored\n            car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped\n            one of the most hateful men in all\n            of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.\n\n                         PAUL\n            Wow.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            We blacked our hands and faces.  At\n            midnight we crept out of the forest\n            and into the village.  The name of\n            the village was Mhravitch.\n            Remember that name!\n\n                         PAUL\n            Mhravitch.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            We came up behind a sentry, and\n            your father slit his throat before\n            he could utter a sound.\n\n                         PAUL\n                   (involuntarily)\n            Uck.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            Don't care for cold steel?  A knife\n            is worse than a bullet?\n\n                         PAUL\n            I don't know.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            The story gets hairier.  Should I\n            stop?\n\n                         PAUL\n            Go on.\n\n                         HAROLD\n            We caught another Kraut alone in a\n            back lane.  Your father choked him\n            to death with a length of piano\n            wire.  Your father was quite a\n            virtuoso with piano wire.  That's\n            nicer than a knife, isn't it--as\n            long as you don't look at the face\n            afterwards.  The face turns a\n            curious shade of avocado.  I must\n            ask the doctor why that is.  At any\n            rate, we stole into the back of the\n            inn, and, with the permission of\n            the management, we poisoned the\n            wine of six Krauts who were\n            carousing there.\n\n                         PAUL\n            Where did you get the poison?\n\n                         HAROLD\n            We carried cyanide capsules.  We\n            were supposed to swallow them in\n            case we were captured.  It was your\n            father's opinion that the Krauts\n            needed them more than we did at the\n            time.\n\n                         PAUL\n            And one of them was the Beast of\n            Yugoslavia?\n                         HAROLD\n            The Beast was upstairs, and he came\n            running downstairs, for his men\n            were making loud farewells and last\n            wills and testaments--editorializing\n            about the hospitality they had\n            received.  And your father said to\n            him in perfect German, which he had\n            learned in the Spanish Civil War,\n            \"Major, something tragic seems to\n            have happened to your bodyguard.  I\n            am Harold Ryan, of the United\n            States of America.  You, I believe,\n            are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\"\n\nBlackout.\n\nSCENE SEVEN\n\nSILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  The sounds of a Nazi rally come\nup slowly: \"Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!\"  Spotlight\ncomes up on MAJOR SIEGFRIED VON KONIGSWALD, and officer in\nthe dreaded SS.  He is in full ceremonial uniform.  The\nsounds fade.\n\n                         VON KONIGSWALD\n                   (sadly, resignedly, remembering)\n            Ja ja.  Ja ja.\n                   (pause)\n            I am Major Siegfried von Konigswald.\n            They used to call me \"The Beast of\n            Yugoslavia,\" on account of all the\n            people I had tortured and shot--and\n            hanged.  We'd bop 'em on the head.\n            We'd hook 'em up to the electricity.\n            We'd stick 'em with hypodermic\n            syringes full of all kinds of stuff.\n            One time we killed a guy with\n            orange juice.  There was a train\n            wreck, and two of the freight cars\n            were loaded with oranges, so we had\n            oceans of orange juice.  It was a\n            joke--how much orange juice we had.\n            And we were interrogating a guy one\n            day, and he wouldn't talk, and the\n            next thing I know--somebody's\n            filling up this big syringe with\n            orange juice.\n                   (pause)\n            There was a guerrilla war going on.\n            You couldn't tell who was a\n            guerrilla and who wasn't.\n            Even if you got one, it was still a\n            civilian you got.  Telling\n            Americans what a guerrilla war is\n            like--that's coals to Newcastle.\n            How do you like that for idiomatic\n            English? \"Coals to Newcastle.\"\n                   (laughs)\n            That Harold Ryan--he says he spoke\n            to me in perfect German?  He talks\n            German like my ass chews gum.  I'm\n            glad to hear the wonderful thing he\n            said before he killed me.  I sure\n            didn't understand it the first time\n            around.  I figured he was a\n            Lithuanian or something, which will\n            give you an idea of how wrong you\n            can be.  All I knew was he was very\n            proud about something, and he had a\n            machine pistol, and it was aimed at\n            me.  The woods were full of all\n            kinds of nuts who were proud of\n            some damn thing or other, and they\n            all had guns.  They were always\n            looking for revenge.  You find a\n            way to bottle revenge--that's the\n            end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola.\n                   (pause)\n            Harold Ryan said he killed maybe\n            two hundred guys.  I killed a\n            hundred times that many, I bet.\n            That's still peanuts, of course,\n            compared to what that crazy\n            Looseleaf did.  Harold and me--we\n            was doing it the hard way.  I hope\n            the record books will show that.\n            There should be a little star or\n            something by the names of the guys\n            who did it the hard way.\n                   (pause)\n            I'm up in Heaven now, like that\n            little Wanda June kid.  I wasn't\n            hit by no ice-cream truck.  Harold\n            Ryan killed me with his bare hands.\n            He was good.  My eyes popped out.\n            My tongue stuck out like a red\n            banana.  I shit in my pants.  It\n            was a mess.\n                   (pause)\n            When I got up on the day I died, I\n            said, \"What a beautiful day this is.\n            What a beautiful part of the\n            world.\" The whole planet was\n            beautiful.  Up here I meet guys\n            from other planets.\n                   (laughs)\n            We got some really crazy-looking\n            guys up here.  Their planets\n            weren't anywhere near as nice as\n            Earth.  They had clouds all the\n            time.  They never saw a clear blue\n            sky.  They never saw snow.  They\n            never saw an ocean.  They had some\n            little lakes, but you couldn't go\n            swimming in them.  The lakes were\n            acid.  You go swimming, you\n            dissolve.  We got some guys up here\n            who got shoved in them lakes.  They\n            dissolved.\n                   (pause)\n            Harold Ryan stopped talking German\n            to me there in Yugoslavia.  He\n            switched to English, so I finally\n            got some kind of idea what he was\n            so burned up about.  He wanted\n            revenge for the guy we killed with\n            orange juice.  I don't know how he\n            ever found out about it.  There was\n            just three of us there when we did\n            it--me and two regular military\n            doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up\n            afterwards must have squealed.  If\n            I'd lived through the war, and they\n            tried me for war crimes and all\n            that, I'd have to tell the court, I\n            guess, \"I was only following\n            orders, as a good soldier should.\n            Hitler told me to kill this guy\n            with orange juice.\"\n\nBlackout.\n\nSCENE EIGHT\n\nDARKNESS.

Not here,\n            not here.  Tell Penelope I loved\n            her--in my clownish way.
