Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the\ndarkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting.\nA SINGER is heard singing the first bars of \"All God's\nChillun Got Shoes.\"  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY\nstand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They\nare motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening\nmaterializes outside the windows.\n\nThe lights come up on the living room of a rich man's\napartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts\nand wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master\nbedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the\nkitchen and so on.\n\n<b>                         PENELOPE\n</b>            How do you do.  My name is Penelope\n            Ryan.

I find it\n            disgusting and frightening that a\n            killer should be a respected member\n            of society.  Gentleness must\n            replace violence everywhere, or we\n            are doomed.\n\n<b>                         PENELOPE\n</b>                   (to LOOSELEAF)\n            Would you like to say something\n            about killing, Colonel?\n\n<b>                         LOOSELEAF\n</b>                   (embarrassed)\n            Jesus--I dunno.

He\n            disappeared in a light plane over\n            the Amazon Rain Forest, where he\n            hoped to find diamonds as big as\n            cantaloupes.  His pilot was Colonel\n            Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the\n            bomb on Nagasaki.\n                   (hyena laughs)\n            I should explain the doorbells in\n            this apartment.  They were built by\n            Abercrombie and Fitch.  They are\n            actual recordings of animal cries.\n            The back doorbell is a hyena, which\n            you've just heard.  The front\n            doorbell is a lion's roar.\n                   (to the wings)\n            Would you let them hear it please?\n                   (lion roars)\n            Thank you.\n\nPAUL, her twelve-year-old son, enters from corridor, a\nsensitive, neatly dressed little rich boys.\n\n<b>                         PENELOPE\n</b>            And this is my son, Paul.

Today was\n            going to be my birthday, but I was\n            hit by an ice-cream truck before I\n            could have my party.  I am dead now.\n            I am in Heaven.  That is why my\n            parents did not pick up the cake at\n            the bakery.  I am not mad at the\n            ice-cream truck driver, even though\n            he was drunk when he hit me.  It didn't\n            hurt much.  It wasn't even as bad as the\n            sting of a bumblebee.  I am really\n            happy here!  It's so much fun.  I\n            am glad the driver was drunk.  If\n            he hadn't been, I might not have\n            got to Heaven for years and years\n            and years.  I would have had to go\n            to high school first, and then\n            beauty college.  I would have had\n            to get married and have babies and\n            everything.  Now I can just play\n            and play and play.  Any time I want\n            any pink cotton candy I can have\n            some.  Everybody up here is happy--\n            the animals and the dead soldiers\n            and people who went to the electric\n            chair and everything.

As always, he is friendly and\nembarrassed.\n\n<b>                         LOOSELEAF\n</b>            When Penelope asked me to say\n            something about dropping the bomb\n            on Nagasaki, I didn't give a very\n            good answer, I guess.  It's a very\n            complicated question.  Jesus--you\n            know?  You have to explain what\n            it's like to be in the Air Force\n            and how they give you your orders\n            and all that.  What it feels like\n            to be in a plane, what the world\n            looks like down there.  After I got\n            home from the war, the minister of\n            my church asked me if I would speak\n            to a scout troop that met in the\n            church basement.  So I did.  They\n            met on Thursday nights.  I used to\n            belong to that troop.  I never made\n            Eagle Scout.  But you know\n            something?  It's a very strange\n            kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout.\n            They always seem so lonesome, like\n            they'd worked real hard to get a\n            job nobody else cares about.  They\n            get a whole bunch of merit badges.\n            That's how you get to be an Eagle\n            Scout.  I don't think I had over\n            five or six merit badges.  The only\n            one I remember is Public Health.\n            That was a bitch.  The Boy Scout\n            Manual said I was supposed to find\n            out what my town did about sewage.\n            Jesus, they just dumped it all in\n            Sugar Creek.\n                   (laughs idiotically)\n            Sugar Creek!  That was a long time\n            ago, but it's all coming back to me\n            now.  There was another merit badge\n            you could get for roller skating.\n            There used to be a roller rink at a\n            bend in Sugar Creek, up above where\n            the sewage went in.  I got in a\n            fight there one time.  I had on\n            roller skates, and the guy I was\n            fighting had on basketball shoes.\n            He had a tremendous advantage over\n            me.  He was a little guy, but he\n            beat the shit out of me.  I had to\n            laugh like hell.  Don't ever fight\n            a guy when you've got on roller\n            skates.\n                   (silence)\n            Jesus--I remember my mother used to\n            make me chew bananas for a full\n            minute before I swallowed--so I\n            wouldn't get sick.  Makes you\n            wonder what else your parents told\n            you that wasn't true.\n\nBlackout.\n\n<b>SCENE FIVE\n</b>\nSPOTLIGHT comes up on HAROLD.

All I knew was he was very\n            proud about something, and he had a\n            machine pistol, and it was aimed at\n            me.  The woods were full of all\n            kinds of nuts who were proud of\n            some damn thing or other, and they\n            all had guns.  They were always\n            looking for revenge.

Their planets\n            weren't anywhere near as nice as\n            Earth.  They had clouds all the\n            time.  They never saw a clear blue\n            sky.  They never saw snow.  They\n            never saw an ocean.  They had some\n            little lakes, but you couldn't go\n            swimming in them.  The lakes were\n            acid.  You go swimming, you\n            dissolve.  We got some guys up here\n            who got shoved in them lakes.  They\n            dissolved.\n                   (pause)\n            Harold Ryan stopped talking German\n            to me there in Yugoslavia.  He\n            switched to English, so I finally\n            got some kind of idea what he was\n            so burned up about.  He wanted\n            revenge for the guy we killed with\n            orange juice.  I don't know how he\n            ever found out about it.  There was\n            just three of us there when we did\n            it--me and two regular military\n            doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up\n            afterwards must have squealed.  If\n            I'd lived through the war, and they\n            tried me for war crimes and all\n            that, I'd have to tell the court, I\n            guess, \"I was only following\n            orders, as a good soldier should.\n            Hitler told me to kill this guy\n            with orange juice.\"\n\nBlackout.\n\n<b>SCENE EIGHT\n</b>\nDARKNESS.
