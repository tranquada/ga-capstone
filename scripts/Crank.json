How discussion can lead to\n                    clarity?\n          \n           HEV is running out of patience.\n          \n                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)\n                    Clearly you are operating under a false\n                    pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did\n                    not \"pull the Anselmo job together.\" In\n                    fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the\n                    Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes\n                    me seventy five hunna dollars.\n          \n                              CHEV\n                    That's not how I heard it.\n          \n                              ORLANDO\n                    But that's the way it is. That's the way\n                    it is. So you see, I don't know where\n                    Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where\n                    he is, I would probably be there right\n                    now, beating his Gucci ass down.\n          S\n           tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying\n          ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.\n          \n           hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's\n          telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.\n          \n                               CHEV\n                    Alright.\n          \n          The room lets out a collective exhale.
