He talked about how \n                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. \n                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend \n                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, \n                         to this imaginary girl like me, that \n                         he never found.

Bubba had given \n                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and \n                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and \n                         forever. Then, last week, a door that \n                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba \n                         thought this no chance coincidence, \n                         a cosmic force was at work.

What it meant, \n                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. \n                         All he knew was that he hated me for \n                         poisoning the well of idealism that \n                         he had drunk from for so long. I was \n                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. \n                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, \n                         and that sickened him. But on the other \n                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes \n                         and releasing him from the bitter chains \n                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil \n                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and \n                         a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba \n                         felt that there was just one thing left \n                         for us to do.
