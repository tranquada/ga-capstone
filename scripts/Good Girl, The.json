It's like what a story would be. \n                         I was about a boy who was put upon, \n                         his mother was cold and selfish, and \n                         his father wanted him to play football. \n                         Other people didn't get him, especially \n                         girls. Then the boy comes to believe \n                         no one can ever really know him. So \n                         he starts actin' out, drinkin', and \n                         doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end \n                         the boy kills himself but jumpin' over \n                         abridge. The second story was pretty \n                         much the same as the first. Except at \n                         the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' \n                         a bottle of bug poison.\n \n\n                                     JUSTINE\n                         Your stories are intense.\n\n\n                                     HOLDEN\n                         I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. \n                         Somethin' great.

One of our \n                         best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. \n                         Gwen was a real class act.

He was \n                         so fixed on the idea thateven when the \n                         clouds started rollin' in, and the sky \n                         was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. \n                         All my thoughts turned to death.

He talked about how \n                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. \n                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend \n                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, \n                         to this imaginary girl like me, that \n                         he never found.

Bubba had given \n                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and \n                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and \n                         forever. Then, last week, a door that \n                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba \n                         thought this no chance coincidence, \n                         a cosmic force was at work.

What it meant, \n                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. \n                         All he knew was that he hated me for \n                         poisoning the well of idealism that \n                         he had drunk from for so long. I was \n                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. \n                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, \n                         and that sickened him. But on the other \n                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes \n                         and releasing him from the bitter chains \n                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil \n                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and \n                         a foll, and that was beautiful.

It was kinda different from \n                         the other one, but kinda the same. It \n                         was about a woman who was put upon. \n                         Whose job was a prison, and whose life \n                         had lost all meaning. Other people don't \n                         get her, especially her husband. One \n                         day she meets a boy who is also put \n                         upon, and they fall in love. After spending \n                         their whole lives not getting got, with \n                         one look they get eachother completely. \n                         In the end, the boy and the girl run \n                         away together in the wilderness, never \n                         to be heard from again.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGood Girl, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Mike White\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:07.952801"}
