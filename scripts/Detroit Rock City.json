MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Decorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, \n               and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green \n               and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only.\n\n               MRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries \n               a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma \n               Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank.\n\n               HUMMING \"We've Only Just Begun,\" Mrs. Bruce crouches next to \n               her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track.  \n               She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. \n               Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil \n               Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters \n               and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor \n               ordered.\n\n               Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover \n               closed and FLICKS \"Play.\" Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips \n               her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen \n               Carpenter.\n\n               Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR.  \n               Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling \n               her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters...\n\n<b>               IT'S KISS!\n</b>\n               Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume \n               control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The \n               music is even louder now.\n\n               Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover.  \n               It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. \n               Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to \n               reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away.\n\n               As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with \n               all her frantic might.\n\n               SCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a \n               shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence!\n\n               Then, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she \n               grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...\n\n<b>                                KISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO\n</b>\n               Mrs. Bruce's blood boils.\n\n<b>                                     MRS.

LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of \n               other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly \n               trees. \n\n               Two-car garage.\n\n               A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across \n               which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear \n<b>               MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, \n</b>               inhuman.\n\n               CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE \n               BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.\n\n<b>               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is \n               plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs.  \n               The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, \n               magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted \n               floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail.\n\n               The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast \n               a familiar tune offensively off-key.\n\n<b>                                     BOYS SINGING\n</b>                         \"I wanna rock 'n' roll all night and \n                         party every day!\"\n\n               They stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band \n               \"Mystery.\" Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs.\n\n               HAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his \n               vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm \n               guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but \n               knowing the others, that doesn't say much.\n\n               LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad \n               posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes \n               everything way-too-seriously.\n\n               TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, \n               Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals \n               or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.\n\n               JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like \n               a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. \n               The big drum bears the word \"Mystery\" painted on its skin \n               with a lightning \"S\" just like the KISS logo.\n\n               They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and \n               thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol.  \n               Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.\n\n<b>                                     HAWK\n</b>                         Thank you, Cleveland!

Lex \n               quickly yanks it away from him.\n\n<b>                                     LEX\n</b>                         What the fuck, Trip?

The hottest band \n                         in the world... KISS!!\n\n               They all make that BREATH SOUND that mimics a screaming crowd.  \n               Suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like \n               a spotlight. Lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the \n               cellar window.\n\n<b>               LEX'S POV\n</b>\n               A baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides \n               SCREECHES into the driveway. Mrs. Bruce gets out and STOMPS \n               toward the house. Lex gasps at the sight.\n\n<b>                                     LEX\n</b>                         Shit!

Trip kicks half-empty beer \n               bottles under the bed. Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around \n               the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth.\n\n               KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Mrs. Bruce pounds on the cellar window \n               crouching to see in. She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.\n\n<b>                                     MRS.

The others follow.\n\n<b>               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The front door opens. Jam steps out to greet his mom with a \n               nervous smile.

Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of \n               the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis.\n\n<b>                                     NERD\n</b>                         Hey, I'm responsible for that!\n\n               CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and \n               the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is \n               back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his \n               hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.\n\n<b>               AROUND A CORNER\n</b>\n               Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose \n               stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water \n               fountain pipe.

Ketchup spatters \n               across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the \n               mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream.\n\n               The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their \n               nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms \n               back, body quaking at every splat.

Hawaiian backwash \n               spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards \n               from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.\n\n               Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a \n               chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his \n               drumsticks.\n\n               As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, \n               snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex \n               THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving \n               a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.\n\n               Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he \n               hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.\n\n               Bobby shrieks.\n\n               Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can \n               off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose \n               with fruit punch for snot.\n\n               Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes \n               the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out \n               a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.\n\n               Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head \n               swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, \n               unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking \n               Bobby out cold.\n\n               Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.\n\n<b>                                     LEX\n</b>                         Not so fast, stella.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n               Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with \n               Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. \n               Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of \n               Barbara's shoulders.\n\n               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the \n               stella, snickering.\n\n<b>                                     BARBARA\n</b>                         When they wake up, they're gonna \n                         come looking for you jerks.

He proceeds \n               to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but \n               Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. \n               The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks \n               him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. \n               Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his \n               package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?\n\n               Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start \n               CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his \n               drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, \n               until...\n\n               The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to \n               hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster \n               than the disco ball above his head.\n\n               He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.\n\n               Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING-\n               IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the \n               edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.\n\n               The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear \n               a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. \n               It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally \n               stops.\n\n               Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at \n               him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his \n               face.\n\n<b>                                     HAWK\n</b>                         Wow.

The show must go on!\n\n               Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The \n               emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk \n               faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.\n\n               The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly \n               start CLAPPING again.\n\n               Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger \n               Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into \n               the crowd. The women actually fight over it.\n\n               Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and \n               hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may \n               be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality.\n\n               Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing \n               the crowd of very responsive ladies.\n\n               He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does \n               an \"air guitar\" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young \n               from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.\n\n               Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking \n               his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger \n               and touches one of his cheeks: \"hot stuff\" (he does this in \n               a manly way of course).\n\n               Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear \n               bunching up in his crack.\n\n               The women WHOO-HOO.\n\n               He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go \n               ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and \n               wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream \n               in orgastic joy.\n\n               Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! \n               The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's \n               whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. \n               Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw \n               suggestively.\n\n               At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.\n\n               He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His \n               Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs \n               sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go \n               batty.\n\n               Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. \n               Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off \n               first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes \n               flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN \n               in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.\n\n               Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance \n               and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the \n               bar.\n\n<b>                                 DRUM ROLL / NEGOTIATION\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

The costumes. The make-up. The \n               blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. The flashing KISS sign. Ace's \n               smoking guitar. Gene's spewing fire. Paul's rockin' vocals. \n               Peter's kick-ass beat.\n\n               Then, something really weird happens.\n\n               The crowd behind the boys heaves forward. Jam is pushed like \n               a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front \n               of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage \n               landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before \n               Peter's drum solo is about to start.\n\n               Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws \n               his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it \n               comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage \n               distracts him.\n\n               All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside \n               edge of one of the drums.\n\n               Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his \n               sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in \n               SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see \n               the word \"Mystery\" clearly as it twirls.\n\n               Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings \n               it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes \n               with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic \n               platform.\n\n               Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience \n               barely missing the claws of some security guards.\n\n               The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage \n               exuberance.
