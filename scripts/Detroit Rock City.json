MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Decorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, \n               and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green \n               and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only.\n\n               MRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries \n               a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma \n               Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank.\n\n               HUMMING \"We've Only Just Begun,\" Mrs. Bruce crouches next to \n               her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track.  \n               She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. \n               Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil \n               Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters \n               and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor \n               ordered.\n\n               Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover \n               closed and FLICKS \"Play.\" Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips \n               her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen \n               Carpenter.\n\n               Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR.  \n               Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling \n               her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters...\n\n               IT'S KISS!\n\n               Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume \n               control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The \n               music is even louder now.\n\n               Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover.  \n               It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. \n               Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to \n               reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away.\n\n               As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with \n               all her frantic might.\n\n               SCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a \n               shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence!\n\n               Then, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she \n               grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...\n\n                                KISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO\n\n               Mrs. Bruce's blood boils.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                         KISS! The devil's music!\n\n               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of \n               other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly \n               trees. \n\n               Two-car garage.\n\n               A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across \n               which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear \n               MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, \n               inhuman.\n\n               CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE \n               BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.\n\n               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is \n               plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs.  \n               The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, \n               magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted \n               floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail.\n\n               The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast \n               a familiar tune offensively off-key.\n\n                                     BOYS SINGING\n                         \"I wanna rock 'n' roll all night and \n                         party every day!\"\n\n               They stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band \n               \"Mystery.\" Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs.\n\n               HAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his \n               vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm \n               guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but \n               knowing the others, that doesn't say much.\n\n               LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad \n               posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes \n               everything way-too-seriously.\n\n               TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, \n               Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals \n               or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.\n\n               JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like \n               a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. \n               The big drum bears the word \"Mystery\" painted on its skin \n               with a lightning \"S\" just like the KISS logo.\n\n               They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and \n               thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol.  \n               Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great \n                         crowd. But after three and a half \n                         hours of kick-ass rock and seven \n                         encores on top of that, I'm sorry to \n                         say that this time we really gotta \n                         get back to our hotel rooms and fuck \n                         some groupies.\n\n               Behind him, Trip grabs Lex's bass and swings it by the neck \n               at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. Lex \n               quickly yanks it away from him.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass!\n\n               Jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         That was curly!\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Just one more day of school to get \n                         through, girls, before tomorrow \n                         night... Live!\n                              (getting excited)\n                         COBO Hall! Detroit, Michigan!\n                              (like an announcer)\n                         You wanted the best!\n\n                                     ALL FOUR BOYS\n                         You got the best! The hottest band \n                         in the world... KISS!!\n\n               They all make that BREATH SOUND that mimics a screaming crowd.  \n               Suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like \n               a spotlight. Lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the \n               cellar window.\n\n               LEX'S POV\n\n               A baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides \n               SCREECHES into the driveway. Mrs. Bruce gets out and STOMPS \n               toward the house. Lex gasps at the sight.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Shit! It's Jam's mom!\n\n               Jam GULPS as if he's just shat out an whole can of Lincoln \n               logs.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         My mom? Oh, no! What's she doing \n                         here?\n\n               Lex quickly throws a KISS towel over a TV tray hiding a bong, \n               cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. Trip kicks half-empty beer \n               bottles under the bed. Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around \n               the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth.\n\n               KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Mrs. Bruce pounds on the cellar window \n               crouching to see in. She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                              (muffled through glass)\n                         Jeremiah! Jeremiah Bruce! You get \n                         out here this instant!\n\n               The boys looks up like innocent, wide-eyed angels. Jam waves.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Oh, hi, mom.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                              (screams)\n                         NOW!\n\n               Jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn, denim \n               jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor, then runs \n               upstairs. The others follow.\n\n               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\n\n               The front door opens. Jam steps out to greet his mom with a \n               nervous smile. Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand at a safe distance \n               in the foyer behind him.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         What's up?\n\n               Mrs. Bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the KISS \n               LOVE GUN record waving it in his face.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                         The devil's body count, that's what's \n                         up! Don't you know what KISS stands \n                         for? \"Knights in Satan's Service!\"\n\n               She hauls Jam across the lawn. Hawk, Lex, and Trip step onto \n               the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment. Mrs. Bruce \n               stuffs the record in the trash can then throws Jam in the \n               front seat. SCREECH, the station wagon pulls away.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Jam has yet to do an overnight with \n                         us.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         I had a nightmare once that something \n                         like this might happen. I hope he \n                         doesn't get grounded again. If he \n                         misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I \n                         don't know if he'll be able to handle \n                         it.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Lex, quit trying to always jinx \n                         things. Don't worry, dudes. Nobody's \n                         missing that concert tomorrow night.\n\n               MAIN TITLES\n\n               CLOSE-UP\n\n               The LOVE GUN album sitting in the trash can. CAMERA MOVES IN \n               on the round label till it FILLS THE FRAME. The record begins \n               to spin like on a turntable as CAMERA DESCENDS INTO the little \n               hole ENGULFING THE FRAME IN BLACK. This LEADS us INTO...\n\n               OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE\n\n               \"ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NITE\" BLASTS the way it's supposed to \n               sound. The jammin' KISS classic is accompanied by a barrage \n               of QUICK CUTS depicting KISS mania. TV appearances. Concert \n               footage. Magazine covers. Comic Books. Posters. Art work. \n               KISS merchandise, dolls, lunch boxes, clothes, etc.\n\n               We see the BAND do their thing in authentic CLIPS FROM REAL \n               SHOWS. GENE, PAUL, ACE, AND PETER SHOUTING IT OUT LOUD.\n\n               The MONTAGE is a colorful, kick-ass kaleidoscope of the entire \n               KISS phenomena. CUT TO the BEAT of this seminal anthem.\n\n               The FINAL IMAGE is the KISS \"DESTROYER\" POSTER.\n\n               END CREDITS\n\n                                       TICKET CHECK\n\n               INT. JAM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               The sun's early morning rays beam through the KISS \"Destroyer\" \n               poster taped onto a window shade. The phone RINGS. Jam bolts \n               upright, his profile blocking the poster. He has just awakened \n               under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix.\n\n               Still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee-\n               shirt and blue jeans, Jam leaps out of bed unwittingly \n               planting a foot in the handle of a Bullworker (a piece of \n               exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two \n               handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one \n               of the bed's legs.\n\n               Jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the Bullworker's \n               powerful springs out to maximum tension. No sooner does he \n               pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across \n               it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. Despite the \n               Bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, Jam does manage \n               to get the phone to his ear.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Hello?\n\n               The phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap \n               from the dresser and WHACK Jam on the head.\n\n               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Hawk is on the phone as Lex and Trip scour every inch of the \n               cluttered room on their hands and knees searching frantically \n               for something.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Jam, listen up.\n\n                                     JAM (O.S.)\n                         Hawk?\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Just listen up, man, cause we are in \n                         a quandary.\n\n               INT.

On the wall a picture \n               of President Carter hangs next to Old Glory. The words \"Be \n               Quiet\" are written on the blackboard.\n\n               Students study, read, doodle, sleep. Jam is at his desk \n               touching up the word \"Mystery\" on his drumstick. Next to him \n               sits BETH. Quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him \n               wanting to say something, but not having the guts.\n\n               Pleased with his work, Jam puts the drumsticks on the desk \n               and opens a Peter Criss album cover notebook depicting \n               countless doodles of the KISS logo, the Mystery logo, and \n               renderings of Peter Criss.\n\n               Beth SIGHS and opens her own notebook. Drawings of hearts \n               fill the pages. In them is written \"Beth + Jeremiah\" and \"I \n               love Jeremiah.\"\n\n               Then, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto \n               the floor. Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just \n               as he bends to get it too. THUD, they bash heads.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Oof!\n                              (whispering)\n                         Sorry.\n\n               Rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         No problem.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Thanks.\n\n               He stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs \n               down. Jam and Beth stare at each other. There's a mutual \n               crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. \n               Both want to speak, neither does. They awkwardly go back to \n               their notebooks.\n\n               Mustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers...\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Beth?\n\n               Beth spins too quickly. Her pen flies out of her hand.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         Yes?\n\n               BOINK! The pen hits Jam in the eye.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Ow!\n\n               Feeling awful, Beth moves in to help. The teacher looks up \n               sternly.\n\n                                     STUDY HALL TEACHER\n                         Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is there a \n                         problem?\n\n                                     BETH\n                         No. No problem.\n\n               Jam points to his eye.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Just a little pink eye. No reason to \n                         panic.\n\n               Unamused, the teacher goes back to grading.\n\n                                     BETH\n                              (whispering)\n                         Sorry.\n\n                                     JAM\n                              (handing back pen)\n                         It's okay.\n\n               Beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot. Jam does too. \n               Ah, teenage awkwardness. Finally, Beth musters up some \n               courage.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         Jeremiah?\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Yeah?\n\n               She hems and haw, then...\n\n                                     BETH\n                         I wanted to tell you something... \n                         I...\n\n               Suddenly, Beth is rudely interrupted by HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK \n               coming from the P.A.

STAIRWAY - DAY\n\n               Meanwhile, Elvis HUFFS and PUFFS up a flight of stairs \n               arriving at a set of swinging doors. He goes to push one in, \n               but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him \n               backward.\n\n               From behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. BLAST! \n               A hail of foam covers Elvis's face. Hawk shoves the \n               extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards \n               down the stairs. He topples ass-over-head till he hits the \n               landing.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         You're way out of your league, Elvis.\n\n               Elvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog. Looking \n               up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. No sign of \n               Hawk.\n\n               INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Trip kicks a bathroom stall violently.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Fuck!

Quit acting all squeezed out.\n\n               Trip grabs Lex by the collar, yanks him off the toilet and \n               shoves him against the wall.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that \n                         the shit hit the fan just like you \n                         said it would, you snug sonofabitch! \n                         You fuckin' jinxed us!\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Smug, Trip!

Hawk first. Suddenly, Hawk backs up again \n               into Trip and Lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         A skirt just came around the corner.\n\n               Hawk, Trip, and Lex run back and pile into the last stall.  \n               All three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the \n               walls for balance.\n\n               A FOXY GIRL hurries into the stall next to theirs. We see \n               the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition.  \n               The three boys don't make a sound as they watch her sit down.\n\n               As she glances up, they recoil fast. They whisper super-quiet.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         That's Sherry VanHafton.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         I've been in love with her since the \n                         second grade.\n\n               Then, a SOUND OF TINKLING. They all throw their hands over \n               their mouths to stifle the giggles. Suddenly, POOT! She lets \n               out an ECHOED FART.

That stinks!\n\n               Just then, the SOUND OF CRACKING PORCELAIN, as the toilet \n               they're standing on breaks into pieces with a SMASH. They \n               topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing \n               the foxy chick sitting on the can. Water GUSHES everywhere \n               as she screams bloody murder, getting doused ruining her \n               Farrah-do.\n\n               They bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent \n               of toilet water.

His face becomes a mask of \n               pure terror. We hear a THUNDER CLAP as Jam puts his hands \n               together and closes his eyes humbling himself.

THUNDER \n               BELCHES and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened \n               crucifixes along the structure. We hear a SCARY ORGAN theme.\n\n               INT.

Hawk attaches a dial. \n               Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long \n               plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                              (re:squeeze pump/tube)\n                         Wonder if you could smoke shit out \n                         of this?\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Maybe some tunage'll chase those \n                         blues away.\n\n               Hawk turns the radio on and a HIGH FREQUENCY WHINE pours \n               from its speaker. He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, \n               until a DJ's VOICE comes through crisp and clear.\n\n                                     DJ'S VOICE\n                         ...and this is Simple Simon on the \n                         rock of Detroit, W.A.R.P., home of \n                         the biggest KISS giveaway in the \n                         history of the universe!\n\n               Detroit?

He tears one off and dust flies everywhere.\n\n               He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was \n               holding before an advancing vampire.\n\n                                     MR.J\n                              (hoarsely)\n                         Get the hell out of here, Verudi! \n                         You disgust me!\n\n               Hawk and Lex observe that Trip has been successful, then do \n               a Three Stooges-style handshake, whispering \"Curly!\"\n\n               INT.

Ketchup spatters \n               across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION.

He is in \n               pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his \n               own pratfall. He hoists himself back into his chair.\n\n               Hawk, Trip, and Lex suddenly barge into the office, followed \n               by the outraged nun.\n\n                                     NUN\n                         You kids can't go in there!\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         It's okay, we're old buds of Father \n                         McNulty...

He wipes the pizza \n               off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back \n               and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny \n               the satisfaction of hearing him scream.\n\n               Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's \n               dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze.\n\n               Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and \n               looks at his handiwork.\n\n                                     KENNY\n                         There. Nice and clean.\n\n               He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he \n               suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh!\n\n                                     KENNY\n                         Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band!\n\n               Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching \n               in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's \n                         leave KISS out of it.

He raises his eyes and turns to the \n               CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the \n               Indian in that \"Keep America Beautiful\" litter ad.\n\n               Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.\n\n                                     KENNY\n                         So.

He \n               blows some smoke in Kenny's face.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Well, let's recap, shall we? You \n                         slapped all of us, yelled at me, \n                         used my head for a rag, threw me on \n                         the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8-\n                         track under the wheels of a passing \n                         semi.\n                              (puffing on cig)\n                         So, if the lesson was that you're a \n                         dick with ears and a really bad \n                         haircut, then, yes...

Meanwhile, Hawk's \n               eyes glaze over.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me...\n\n               Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly \n               empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his \n               side.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         ...what exactly did my mother say \n                         last night?\n\n               Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         You heard me, prick. What did my \n                         mother say last night?\n\n               Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little \n               laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk.\n\n                                     KENNY\n                         Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what \n                         your mother said last night.\n                              (beat)\n                         She said that I was the fuck of her \n                         life.\n\n               Hawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the \n               ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                              (very Clint Eastwood)\n                         How would you like a nice Hawaiian \n                         Punch?\n\n                                     KENNY\n                              (smirking)\n                         Sure.\n\n               Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's \n               nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash \n               spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards \n               from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.\n\n               Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a \n               chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his \n               drumsticks.\n\n               As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, \n               snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex \n               THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving \n               a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.\n\n               Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he \n               hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.\n\n               Bobby shrieks.\n\n               Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can \n               off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose \n               with fruit punch for snot.\n\n               Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes \n               the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out \n               a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.\n\n               Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head \n               swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, \n               unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking \n               Bobby out cold.\n\n               Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Not so fast, stella.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with \n               Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. \n               Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of \n               Barbara's shoulders.\n\n               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the \n               stella, snickering.\n\n                                     BARBARA\n                         When they wake up, they're gonna \n                         come looking for you jerks.

Behind \n               him stands the marquee for IT'S RAINING MEN, the male strip \n               joint. A DISCO SONG comes from inside.

Even six year olds aren't \n               afraid.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Hey, you little twerps, gimme your \n                         KISS tickets or I'll pop your fuckin' \n                         faces in.\n\n                                     SIX YEAR OLD #1\n                         We don't have any KISS tickets.\n\n                                     SIX YEAR OLD #2\n                         Yeah, KISS sucks!\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         I oughta kick your asses for sayin' \n                         that.\n\n               He grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         But I'm in a hurry so I'll just take \n                         this instead. Now scram.\n\n               The kids run away.\n\n               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT\n\n               The store is crawling with KISS FANS, some reading the comic \n               books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others \n               looking at the poster section. Trip enters on a mission.\n\n               He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER. She's \n               a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a \n               little too much make-up. She smiles at him. Trip returns the \n               smile with a feeble wave. Her mood ring turns from blue to \n               pink.\n\n               Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the \n               way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a \n               LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS pinball \n               machine.\n\n               Trip smiles. The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. He \n               moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the \n               magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler \n               and into the darkened corner.\n\n               He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. The \n               kid is actually pretty good. We also see now the little kid \n               has his face painted like Ace Frehley.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Hey, little kid.\n\n               Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Shit! You just skunked my last ball, \n                         you...\n\n               Trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Okay, booger, your KISS ticket or \n                         your life.\n\n               The little kid says something but Trip's hand muffles his \n               words.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Hunh?\n\n               The kid says what he said before, but it is utterly \n               incomprehensible, once again thanks to Trip's hand.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                              (looking at his hand)\n                         Oh. Okay... But scream and you'll \n                         never live to see puberty. I'll pop \n                         your fuckin' face in.\n\n               Trip pulls his hand away.\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Please sir, don't beat me up. I do \n                         have a KISS ticket, but not on me.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         A likely story. Hand it over, kid.\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                              (bottom lip quivering)\n                         No really. My brother's hanging onto \n                         it for safe keeping. Please, let me \n                         get him for you.\n\n               The kid turns and yells into the store before Trip can stop \n               him.\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Hey, Chongo!\n\n               A titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue \n               of \"Thing\" when he hears his name. CHONGO has a very low \n               forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto \n               his face.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                              (getting scared)\n                         Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna \n                         see KISS that ba...\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's \n                         an all-state track star in every \n                         event.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                              (gleefully)\n                         A tag on your toe.

He is joined by TWO BUDS.\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Besides, I was gonna take your wallet \n                         anyway. After Chongo and his friends \n                         crush your ribcage like a pack of \n                         Luckys.\n\n               Chongo arrives eyeing Trip with distaste. Trip goes white.\n\n                                     CHONGO\n                         This fairy givin' you shit, bro?\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         He was gonna mug me for my KISS \n                         ticket.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Me? Mug? That's nuts. I said, do you \n                         know where I can take a piss.\n\n               Chongo and his two buds laugh. Then, without a second of \n               warning, Chongo belts Trip in the gut. Trip doubles over and \n               falls breathlessly to his knees.\n\n                                     CHONGO\n                         Okay, pimple dick, you've got the \n                         option of walking outside with us or \n                         gettin' dragged out. Either way you're \n                         comin' with us.\n\n               Trip catches his breath.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll \n                         do anything to get out of a beating!\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use \n                         some extra cash for tasty snacks at \n                         the KISS concert our weasly friend \n                         won't be attending.\n\n               Chongo scratches his head.\n\n                                     CHONGO\n                         How much cash do you figure?\n\n                                     LITTLE KID\n                         Take five for a minute, Chongo. Let \n                         me do the math.\n\n               The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme \n               from \"JEOPARDY\" begins. While the kid thinks, Trip looks \n               nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his \n               denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes \n               back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and \n               forearm.\n\n               Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the \n               walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. \n               CREEEAAAACK! Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of \n               SECURITY GUARDS.\n\n               Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot \n               and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain \n               link fence that surrounds the lot.\n\n               He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against \n               the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight \n               beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then \n               SIGHS eased.\n\n                                     LEX\n                              (whispering to self)\n                         I can't believe I'm actually \n                         entertaining the notion of sneaking \n                         in. I oughta have my cranium examined.\n\n               Lex finds a vertical break in the chain link. He lays on his \n               back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the \n               fence. He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also \n               happens to be poorly lit.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.\n\n               Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through \n               when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE\n                         Hey you! Get back in here!\n\n               Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the \n               other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the \n               field.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE\n                         You're not getting far, kid!\n\n               Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his \n               walkie-talkie.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE\n                         We got one just ran into the field \n                         from the north lot!\n\n               The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well-\n               lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of \n               KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks \n               are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity.\n\n               EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT\n\n               Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to \n               huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids \n               being seen by OTHER GUARDS.\n\n               He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading \n               bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and \n               scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE\n                         There he is!\n\n               Lex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel \n               right for him.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Shit!\n\n               He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards \n               leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.\n\n               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI\n\n               The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY \n               BODY. They spin him around roughly.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD\n                         Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta \n                         here!\n\n               They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a \n               roadie.\n\n                                     ROADIE\n                         Hey, what the fuck?\n\n               The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily.\n\n                                     ROADIE\n                         Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb \n                         fuckin' apes.\n\n               The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other \n               roadies join in to defend their comrade.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD\n                         Where'd he go? You see him?\n\n               No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the \n               guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex \n               crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master.\n\n               Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's \n               carried into the building and disappears.\n\n                                 JAM IN A JAM / KISS THIS\n\n               INT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT\n\n               Jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs. \n               Bruce and the priest talk on the alter.\n\n               Beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard. She looks \n               overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained \n               glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support \n               the extravagantly decorated ceiling.\n\n               The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the back.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow \n                         morning, young lady. Run along now.\n\n               Beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door \n               passing a confessional booth. She throws a glance back at \n               the priest and Mrs. Bruce who have returned to conferring, \n               their backs to her. She stealthily ducks into the booth.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                         Now it's been a while since my boy \n                         had holy confession. Could you...?\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                              (smiling)\n                         Consider it done.\n\n               Mrs. Bruce looks down at Jam and sees his drumsticks poking \n               out of his socks. She immediately takes them out and stuffs \n               them into her jacket. Jam doesn't even move.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                         It's about time you gave up on that \n                         stupid dream once and for all. No \n                         son of mine is going to be a career \n                         musician.\n\n               Jam is stung. Mrs. Bruce and the priest head back down the \n               center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors. She \n               eyes Jam.\n\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\n                         Thank you, Father. I'll be back for \n                         him before you know it; after I take \n                         care of some unfinished business.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Just knock loudly, sister.\n\n               He lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the \n               lock, and walks over to Jam.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Come along, son. Get into the booth.\n\n               He helps the despondent Jam up. They walk to the booth and \n               Jam reluctantly gets inside.\n\n               INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n               Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth \n               sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. Her posture is that of \n               someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap.\n\n               We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into his \n               own compartment next door. A moment later the small, eye-\n               level door SLIDES open. The priest's face is barely visible \n               on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. \n                         This is my first confession in... \n                         well... a really long time.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Prepare to receive the Act of Penance.  \n                         How many sins have you committed \n                         since your last confession?\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Just one, Father, but boy was it a \n                         doozy.\n\n               Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam's confession.\n\n               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT\n\n               Hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a \n               rocks glass. Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of \n               him. He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing \n               him kisses from the other side of the bar.\n\n               The EMCEE enters the stage.\n\n                                     EMCEE\n                              (into microphone)\n                         Okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones. \n                         Here comes our next amateur. Let's \n                         have a big hand for Hawk!\n\n               The beginning of a rockin' KISS tune comes over the P.A. and \n               Dicky approaches Hawk.\n\n                                     EMCEE\n                         You're up, Hawk.\n\n               Hawk wakes up fast. There's nothing more sobering than having \n               to undress in public.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         You're not gonna chicken out on me \n                         now, are you? We've got your KISS \n                         song playing and everything.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         I-I c-can't...\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                              (leans in close)\n                         Look, people undress in public \n                         because, A, they're exhibitionists, \n                         B, they're nutcases, or C, they need \n                         the money. I can tell you're not A, \n                         and I hope to hell you're not B. So \n                         my suggestion is, think about why \n                         you're a C and let your body party, \n                         shake your groove thing, boogie oogie \n                         oogie till you just can't boogie no \n                         more.\n\n               Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. He \n               grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it \n                         for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its \n                         head and \n                              (hiccup)\n                         Do it for KISS.\n\n               Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, \n               forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. He proceeds \n               to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but \n               Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. \n               The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks \n               him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. \n               Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his \n               package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?\n\n               Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start \n               CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his \n               drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, \n               until...\n\n               The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to \n               hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster \n               than the disco ball above his head.\n\n               He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.\n\n               Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING-\n               IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the \n               edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.\n\n               The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear \n               a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. \n               It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally \n               stops.\n\n               Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at \n               him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his \n               face.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Wow. I feel a hundred times better!\n\n               He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Thanks lady.\n\n               He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ \n               booth.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Maestro? As you were.\n\n               The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Come on, dude, we got a bunch of \n                         frisky felines waiting for some \n                         entertainment! The show must go on!\n\n               Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The \n               emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk \n               faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.\n\n               The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly \n               start CLAPPING again.\n\n               Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger \n               Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into \n               the crowd. The women actually fight over it.\n\n               Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and \n               hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may \n               be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality.\n\n               Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing \n               the crowd of very responsive ladies.\n\n               He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does \n               an \"air guitar\" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young \n               from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.\n\n               Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking \n               his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger \n               and touches one of his cheeks: \"hot stuff\" (he does this in \n               a manly way of course).\n\n               Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear \n               bunching up in his crack.\n\n               The women WHOO-HOO.\n\n               He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go \n               ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and \n               wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream \n               in orgastic joy.\n\n               Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! \n               The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's \n               whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. \n               Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw \n               suggestively.\n\n               At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.\n\n               He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His \n               Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs \n               sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go \n               batty.\n\n               Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. \n               Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off \n               first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes \n               flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN \n               in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.\n\n               Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance \n               and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the \n               bar.\n\n                                 DRUM ROLL / NEGOTIATION\n\n               INT.

Lex's \n               GRUNTS of pain can be heard from inside.\n\n               AT THE BOTTOM\n\n               The big drum hits the landing hard, tips over, then spins \n               like a quarter getting faster before it stops.\n\n               ON THE ROADIES\n\n               They barrel down the stairs two at a time. Finally reaching \n               the bottom, they grab the drum.\n\n                                     ROADIE #2\n                         Peter's gonna kill us.\n\n               As they carry the drum back up the stairs, we see it is now \n               empty. Once the roadies are gone, CAMERA TILTS UP to the \n               ceiling. There's Lex clutching exposed pipes for dear life, \n               hanging upside down, praying the coast is clear.\n\n                      BETH'S CONFESSION / COMPENSATORY POSSIBILITIES\n\n               INT. CONFESSIONAL - NIGHT\n\n               Jam is at the end of his confession. The priest is still \n               listening on the other side of the screen. Beth sits in the \n               shadows behind Jam.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         So, you see if it wasn't for me, me \n                         and my friends would be at that KISS \n                         concert right now... together.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         That's it?\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Well, this is a unique confession to \n                         say the least, son. And not exactly \n                         the most interesting one I've ever \n                         heard either. You sure you don't \n                         want to talk about... oh, carnal \n                         knowledge with a neighborhood girl \n                         or impure thoughts about the new \n                         student teacher maybe... or how about \n                         finding a box of magazines under \n                         your dad's bed?\n\n                                     JAM\n                         No.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Well then, I suggest you have a seat \n                         on the bench behind you and think of \n                         something a little juicier to confess \n                         than losing KISS tickets. I realize \n                         this is Detroit, but I personally \n                         find, what that rock and roll band \n                         is all about, to be boring as \n                         Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a \n                         little while.\n\n               The priest SLIDES the door shut again. Jam is all but shrouded \n               in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch. It's \n               getting late. He resignedly sits on the bench behind him... \n               right on Beth's lap.\n\n               Jam yells, but Beth throws her hand over his mouth. His eyes \n               bulge. He can't believe what he's seeing. He climbs off Beth \n               and sits next to her.\n\n                                     JAM\n                              (whispering)\n                         Beth? I can't believe it.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         Believe it.\n\n               Jam thinks for a beat. Something still isn't quite clicking.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Are you waiting for confession? I \n                         thought you were Jewish?\n\n               BETH can hardly speak. She gulps thinking of what to say.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         I have a confession. Here it is.\n\n               Beth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in \n               recorded history. She pulls away finally wiping her mouth.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         I didn't mean for that to be so... \n                         intense. Forgive me.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         I don't care. I wanna hear more.\n\n               She lunges at him again, kissing him for dear life. Her lips \n               leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         I've loved you ever since I first \n                         laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've \n                         just always been too scared to show \n                         it.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Beth, I can't believe you just said \n                         that because that's exactly how I've \n                         always felt about you... Call me \n                         Jam. It's my band name.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         You don't know how long I've been \n                         waiting to hear that... Jam!\n\n               He kisses her neck. Unable to stop, they start undressing \n               each other, both breathing heavy.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         We've got to take this slow...\n\n                                     JAM\n                         Right, slow...\n\n                                     BETH\n                         Oh, screw it!\n\n               She tears his tee-shirt open with her teeth.\n\n               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT\n\n               A really buff STRIPPER dressed as a construction worker is \n               on stage with about ten others who stand in the background.  \n               The emcee's hand hovers above the stripper's head.\n\n                                     EMCEE\n                         Okay, ladies, it's down to...

Hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of \n               the rejected strippers, looking the way he feels: pretty \n               damn stupid. He puts on his pants, trying to walk at the \n               same time and falls to his knees.\n\n               A helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up.  \n               It's Amanda looking lustier than ever.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Thanks, miss.\n\n                                     AMANDA\n                         You're too kind.

SMILEY MART - NIGHT\n\n               Trip leafs through a KISS comic, not really paying attention \n               to it. Directly behind him is the register and the CASHIER.\n\n               He starts hearing voices in his head. We see SUPERS of his \n               friends' faces hovering around him.\n\n                                     LEX'S VOICE\n                         I can't believe you're even thinking \n                         of committing a robbery, Trip.

She smiles at him coyly as she \n               plays with her mood ring. He gives her the eye, then returns \n               to his comic.\n\n                                     JAM'S VOICE\n                         And what about that girl, Trip?

All the shoppers and cashier are \n               starring at him. He COUGHS loudly, clearing his throat to \n               cover his outburst. The shoppers go back to shopping.\n\n               A MAN WITH A LONG COAT enters the store, looks around, then \n               takes a spot alongside Trip and opens a Mad Magazine.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                              (whispering to himself)\n                         Okay, bro.

Might as well be now.\n\n               Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at \n               Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in \n               so it looks like he's got a gun. He takes three deep breaths \n               and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, \n               revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers the top \n               half of his face.\n\n               Just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and \n               pulls something over his own head.\n\n               Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at the \n               cashier...\n\n               Just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, \n               pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, \n               pointing it at the cashier as well. The cashier shrieks. So \n               does Trip.\n\n                                     MAN WITH COAT\n                         Evening, honey.

The air is very tense.

Scantily-\n               clad BABES everywhere. Slick, RECORD BIZ-TYPES. Lots of food. \n               Lots of booze. Lots of fun. It's backstage at a KISS concert, \n               come on!\n\n               CAMERA TILTS UP above the partying hordes to find Lex shimming \n               along an exposed duct amid the pipes, sprinklers, and vents. \n               Looking straight down on everybody, Lex is in awe and \n               disbelief.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         This is real.

He GASPS. A \n               door. On it a star. Written on the star, the word, KISS.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Oh, God, they're in there!\n\n               A big-haired HIPSTER in mirrored sunglasses KNOCKS on the \n               dressing room door. It opens, but Lex can't see inside. The \n               hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there.\n\n               Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb. Desperate \n               for a glimpse of his idols, he leans out too far.\n\n               Suddenly, the entire duct collapses. Breaking loose of the \n               ceiling, Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct. Backstage \n               goers leap for cover as SMASH... he hits the ground in a \n               shower of plaster and dust.\n\n               The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut \n               as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it.\n\n               Instantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders.  \n               Before he can react, a slew of OFFICERS have him off his \n               feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his \n               face.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff \n               of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves \n               on the back as they hurry back in.\n\n               Lex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps \n               out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest \n               GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and \n               its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring.  \n               GRRRRRRR!\n\n               Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL \n               walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd.\n\n                                     LEX\n                              (petrified)\n                         Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs!\n\n               Then, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from \n               the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, \n               muscular form making the brick building nearby look like \n               jello.\n\n               Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Wake up, Lex!

He stops, when several other DOGS emerge from the \n               shadows and gather behind the first three. These new mutts \n               immediately join in the GROWLING chorale. The Shepherd snaps \n               at Lex.\n\n                                     LEX\n                              (to the heavens)\n                         God, if you ever get me outta this, \n                         I swear I will never masturbate again!\n\n               The pack BARKS even louder.\n\n                                     LEX\n                              (to heaven again)\n                         I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME!\n\n               INT.

If you \n                         bite my head off, I'll die knowing I \n                         did all I could. It's up to you.\n\n               Lex waits before the GROWLING, SNAPPING canines. Suddenly, \n               the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the \n               frisbee at Lex's feet. Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly \n               dog, who wags its tail and PANTS furiously.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Well, how do you like that?\n\n               Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the \n               dogs shut-up. Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and \n               throws it.\n\n               This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product.\n\n               Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in SLOW \n               MOTION... as the theme from \"CHARIOTS OF FIRE\" begins.\n\n               The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth \n               and runs back toward Lex. It's soon joined by the rest of \n               the pack. That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't \n               going to stop.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         Whoa! Whoa!\n\n               The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the \n               garbage. They surround him licking his face. Lex bursts into \n               unstoppable laughter.\n\n               Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him \n               wagging their tails and PANTING.\n\n                                     LEX\n                              (baby talk)\n                         You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy \n                         to death, y'know that? Sure you do... \n                         Sure you do...\n\n               Lex stops. He hears TALKING coming from inside the windowless, \n               brick building on the other side of the alley. He steps in \n               front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. They \n               obey, quieting instantly. He then tiptoes to a thin crack in \n               the brick wall. The dogs quietly follow.\n\n               Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.\n\n               INT.

He's lost him.\n\n               Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four \n               landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo \n               Hall.

It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes \n               up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each \n               other. Each standing on his own corner. They're all pissed. \n               They meet in the middle of the street as last minute CONCERT \n               GOERS hurry by.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Any luck?\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Plenty, but it was all bad.\n\n                                     LEX\n                         I found the Volvo.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Tickets?\n\n               They all shake no.\n\n                                     HAWK\n                         Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna \n                         see KISS this tour is by some fuckin' \n                         miracle.\n\n               Suddenly, a commotion up the street.

Jam tears it open. His trembling hand reaches in.  \n               All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside.\n\n               Jam pulls out four KISS tickets. Their jaws drop.

They find all the stolen dope \n               and Trip's wallet.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                         Inside that you'll find my KISS Army \n                         picture I.D. and a hundred fifty \n                         bucks cash.\n\n               The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.\n\n                                     TRIP\n                              (to little kid)\n                         Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I was really hoping \n                         things would work out for you, my \n                         weasly, midget friend. You got spunk.\n\n               The little kid for once is speechless.\n\n               Then the ticket taker extends his arm in SLOW MOTION into \n               COBO Hall as if to say \"Entrez Vous.\" The four friends pause.\n\n                                     JAM\n                         This is it!\n\n               They take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe \n               it, then run like the wind into the auditorium.\n\n                                    DETROIT ROCK CITY\n\n               INT. COBO HALL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\n               The lights are out. The lighters have been lit. The CROWDS' \n               ROAR is deafening.\n\n               Jam, Hawk, Trip, and Lex plow their way through the throngs \n               and head straight for the front row just as Simple Simon \n               takes the stage.\n\n                                     SIMPLE SIMON\n                         You wanted the best! And you got the \n                         best! The hottest band in the world... \n                         KISS!!!\n\n               Simple Simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords \n               to DETROIT ROCK CITY BEGIN.\n\n               On the beat, BOOM, FIREWORKS shoot from the floor alighting \n               the place. KISS takes the stage descending on hydraulic \n               elevators.\n\n               ON JAM, HAWK, TRIP, AND LEX\n\n               They're seeing God!\n\n               The show is spectacular. The costumes. The make-up. The \n               blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. The flashing KISS sign. Ace's \n               smoking guitar. Gene's spewing fire. Paul's rockin' vocals. \n               Peter's kick-ass beat.\n\n               Then, something really weird happens.\n\n               The crowd behind the boys heaves forward. Jam is pushed like \n               a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front \n               of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage \n               landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before \n               Peter's drum solo is about to start.\n\n               Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws \n               his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it \n               comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage \n               distracts him.\n\n               All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside \n               edge of one of the drums.\n\n               Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his \n               sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in \n               SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see \n               the word \"Mystery\" clearly as it twirls.\n\n               Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings \n               it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes \n               with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic \n               platform.\n\n               Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience \n               barely missing the claws of some security guards.\n\n               The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage \n               exuberance. Will it ever get any better than this?\n\n               FREEZE FRAME.\n\n                                                             FADE TO WHITE:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nDetroit Rock City\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Carl V Dupre\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Musical\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:55.186304"}
