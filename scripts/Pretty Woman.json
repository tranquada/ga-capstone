A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house\n  is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.\n\n  A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins\n  appear and disappear in his nimble hands.\n\n<b>  INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT\n</b>\n    EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down\n  at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around\n  forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured\n  by a night's sleep.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (a murmur)\n    Left pocket.\n\n  And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the\n  left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More\n  laughter and applause.\n\n  The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious.\n  Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,\n  is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an\n  investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial\n  researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are\n  in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of\n  documents and folders, the name \"KROSS INDUSTRIES\" is prominent\n  on many of the folders.\n\n<b>          INVESTMENT BANKER 1\n</b>    Our banks certainly doesn't want\n    to discourage Harris Enterprises\n    from investing in California.\n    We think this is a great new venue\n    for you but you've got to\n    understand the mergers and\n    acquisitions market is changing.\n    With the upswing in inflation we\n    have to make these offerings\n    tempting to offset the risk.\n\n<b>          VANCE\n</b>    Look, we're talking about hard\n    assets and a straight liquidation.\n    We have over a thousand man hours\n    in this deal.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>      (losing patience)\n    This is a \"no brainer\".  There's\n    no risk for you.  No one has ever\n    lost money backing Mr. Harris.\n\n<b>          INVESTMENT BANKER 2\n</b>    Not yet.  But ship building is\n    a new endeavor for you...\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>      (cuts him off)\n    Come on.  You know we're not\n    going to go into ship building.\n    Besides, you're the ones with the\n    troubled track record, not us!\n\n<b>          INVESTMENT BANKER 3\n</b>    Bill, be reasonable.  If you're\n    really going to digest Kross\n    Industries that quickly eighteen\n    should not be such a problem.\n    Besides, I don't think there's\n    anywhere else you can go for the\n    money in the time you have.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    It's unacceptable.\n\n  Edward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All\n  eyes are on him.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Draymen Heux has offered me\n    seventy-five in the pool at\n    sixteen and a half.  I can secure\n    the other half personally.  You\n    have until tomorrow morning to\n    make me a better offer.\n\n  The bankers speechlessly stare at him.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    The meeting is over, gentlemen.\n\n  He turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise.\n  Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes\n  with laughter.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Hah!  Did you see the look on\n    their faces?\n\n<b>          VANCE\n</b>    You don't think we pushed too\n    hard?\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    NO way!  They'll come back.  They\n    can't afford not to.  Edward,\n    that bluff was beautiful.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Maybe I should have made it\n    rhyme.\n\n  The others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The\n  others follow suit.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (looking at his watch)\n    Well!  It's late.  We've been\n    at this long enough.\n\n  Stuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The\n    magician's wonderful.\n\n  Vance and Jake exit.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (calling after them)\n    Watch your left pocket.\n\n  A BUTLER has entered the room.\n\n<b>          BUTLER\n</b>    Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss\n    Charles.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Cynthia?  Is she coming out?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    We're about to find out.  Go on.\n    Take care of your guests.\n\n  Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (into phone)\n    Where are you, Cynthia?\n      (beat)\n    I see.\n      (pausing, getting angry)\n    No, I don't expect you to be at\n    my beck-and-call.  Are you coming\n    or not?\n\n<b>  INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in\n  tow.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (all business)\n    Prepare the filing papers.  Have\n    them ready by the middle of the\n    week.  I'll tell you when to\n    submit them.\n\n  The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate\n  toward Edward.\n\n<b>          A MAN\n</b>    Edward!\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (turning on the charm)\n    Yes!\n\n<b>          THE MAN\n</b>    Will we see you at the polo\n    matches Wednesday?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Wouldn't miss it.\n      (abruptly; to Vance)\n    I want this done fast and easy.\n    No slip-ups.  I want to be back\n    in New York by Saturday.  Got it?\n\n  He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.\n\n<b>  INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful\n  WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress.  An elegant woman\n      ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on\n  the shoulder and he turns, startled.\n\n<b>          ELIZABETH\n</b>    Bill?\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>      (flustered)\n    Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,\n    uh, uh, Millicent.\n\n<b>          MILLICENT\n</b>    Lowell.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Lowell, right.  My wife,\n    Elizabeth.\n\n<b>          ELIZABETH\n</b>      (ignoring her)\n    Is Edward leaving?\n\n  Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.\n  Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.\n\n<b>  EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward comes out of the house.  Jags, a limo with waiting\n  DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black\n  Ferrari.  The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of\n  Edward.  Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his\n  impatience under control.  Stuckey comes out of the house and\n  down the walk.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    What's up, where you going?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Give me your car keys, will you,\n    I'm going back to my hotel.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    At least stay for a drink.  This\n    party's for you.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Apologize to Elizabeth for me.\n\n  Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Listen, there're some major local\n    talent inside just dying to meet\n    you...\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (as if delighted)\n    Really?  Some high class gold\n    digger who speaks French better\n    than I do?\n      (turning away)\n    No, thank you.  I just got off\n    the phone with one.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Cynthia's not coming?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    No.\n\n  Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.  He crosses to a\n  black Ferrari and gets in.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Let your driver take you.  We'll\n    move the cars...\n\n  Edward starts the car.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Can you drive a stick?\n\n  The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly\n  stalls.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Edward, give me a break!\n\n  With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway\n  and... stalls again.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Love this car!  Is it new?\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Yes!  And you don't even know\n    where you're going!\n\n  Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.  Stuckey\n  watching, throws up his hands.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    That's the wrong way!\n\n<b>  CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:\n</b>\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes\n  large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...\n\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.\n  The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.\n  Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.  The light turns\n  green.  Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.  The Colt leaves\n  him in the dust.\n\n<b>  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward drives.  He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid\n  himself of his own tired thoughts.\n\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,\n  stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street\n  signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back\n  in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.\n\n<b>  EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted\n  parking lot.\n\n  The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,\n  looking very out of place on the street.\n\n  PANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire\n  escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a\n  short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away.\n\n<b>  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.\n\n<b>  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n  VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom\n  mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up\n  applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.\n  She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny\n  shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at\n  herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs,\n  turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.\n\n<b>  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Faded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks\n  the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.\n  A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously\n  pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig\n  eyes.\n\n<b>          LANDLORD\n</b>    Vivian.\n\n  Vivian turns some \"tough\" on him.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Yeah, what?\n\n<b>          LANDLORD\n</b>    Rent.  You're late.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Don't give me that.  Kit gave it\n    to you yesterday, cash.\n\n<b>          LANDLORD\n</b>    Kit give me nothin'.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (suddenly uncertain)\n    You bullshittin' me?\n\n<b>          LANDLORD\n</b>    Of rent I do not bullshit.\n\n  Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.\n\n<b>          LANDLORD\n</b>    By the end of the week or you're\n    otta here.\n      (a beat)\n    By the way, you look very nice\n    tonight!\n\n<b>  INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN\n</b>\n  Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top.\n  It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She\n  opens it.\n\n<b>  INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open\n  doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up.\n\n  Vivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with\n  them.\n\n<b>  EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried\n  away.\n\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.\n\n  A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.\n  He wears an \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt.\n\n  Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than\n  she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle\n  in a doorway.\n\n  A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little\n  bags to various STREET-TYPES.\n\n  A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists\n  to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie\n  star.  Some go in.\n\n  Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.\n  A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car\n  passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores\n  him.  The black prostitute approaches the car.\n\n<b>          PROSTITUTE\n</b>    Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?\n\n  The Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the\n  car and it drives away.\n\n  A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night\n  coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS\n  as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into\n  a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.\n\n<b>  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks\n  frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the\n  shop.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Chan, you seen Kit tonight?\n\n<b>          COOK 1\n</b>    Hi, hi!  No see nothing.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You do, tell her I'm looking for\n    her.\n\n<b>          COOK 2\n</b>    Looking good, bay-bee.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Yeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit\n    comes in here, tell her stay.\n\n  Both of them nod and smile at Vivian.  Vivian exits.\n\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Skateboard zips by a GROUP.  We SEE a police car parked at the\n  entrance to an alcove.  Also, an ambulance.  The bubblegum\n  lights are going.  A CROWD has gathered.  The happy man with\n  the \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged\n  in tense conversation.\n\n<b>          COP\n</b>    They just pulled her out of a\n    dumpster in the back.  Now talk\n    to me.\n\n<b>          MAN\n</b>    I tell you, man, I don't know who\n    she hang with.\n\n<b>          COP\n</b>    She have a pimp?\n\n<b>          MAN\n</b>    Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a\n    strawberry.  She be out on these\n    streets, day in, day out, tradin'\n    her sorry ass for crack.  And\n    now she dead from it.\n\n  Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body\n  of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried\n  towards the waiting ambulance.  For a moment Vivian thinks\n  it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.\n\n  Vivian surveys the dark street.  And suddenly sees who's she's\n  looking for.  Walks.\n\n<b>  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT\n</b>\n  We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.\n  The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.  The\n  girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.  The young\n  man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.\n  They giggle about something, both obviously high.  Kit looks\n  up, bleary-eyed.  She stops.  Vivian is standing in front of\n  her.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You spent it on drugs, didn't you?\n\n<b>          KIT\n</b>    Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my\n    roommate, Viv.\n\n<b>          CARLOS\n</b>    Lookin' good, baby.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (ignoring him)\n    Did you blow it all, Kit?

He looks down toward the lights of the\n  cop cars.  One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.\n  Vivian waves at the cop.\n\n<b>          CARLOS\n</b>      (threatening to Vivian)\n    Don't take no dates tonight,\n    chica, you got one with me.\n\n  Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.\n\n<b>  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea.  Vivian is still\n  mad at her.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    We worked for that money.  We\n    were gonna put together enough\n    to get out of that dump we live\n    in, get off this street.\n\n<b>          KIT\n</b>    Viv... don't be stupid.  We're\n    whores.\n\n  Vivian looks like she wants to weep.  Or scream.  She does\n  neither.  She slowly nods.  Kit's sorry she said that.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    So I blew our stash.  We could\n    make it all back with one good\n    night on the streets.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    I just saw somebody pulled out\n    of a dumpster.  I wonder how much\n    she made tonight?\n\n<b>          KIT\n</b>    Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay\n    you back.

Vivian turns.  She\n  stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And\n  then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of\n  hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and\n  sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.\n\n  In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious\n  and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    What's that?\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You looking' for some company?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Uh, no.

Even at\n  this hour there is a great deal of activity.  MEN in business\n  suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by.  Vivian's\n  face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of\n  all this luxury.  Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes\n  Edward's arm.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    So let's go.\n\n  Edward guides them across the lobby.  They reach the elevators\n  and go inside.\n\n<b>  INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform\n  that seems just a bit too tight.

Edward closes the doors behind her.\n\n<b>  INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling\n  off the top of the building.  In front of her is a sunken living\n  room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the\n  city below.  For the first time, she is speechless.  Edward\n  closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living\n  room.  Edward picks up a phone.  Vivian checks out the room.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (into the phone)\n    Room service.\n      (to Vivian)\n    What do you drink?\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Diet coke.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (into the phone)\n    Send up a bottle of Crystal\n    champagne.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Can I have some chips?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (into the phone)\n    -- and a bowl of strawberries.\n    Thank you.\n\n  Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room.

Standing over her, he drops\n  THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She\n  picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.\n  She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is\n  standing over her as if waiting.\n\n  She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly\n  turns away.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Let's talk some more first.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Right.\n      (brightly)\n    So!

Vivian motions for him to stay put.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Hey.  I might as well make myself\n    useful.\n\n  Edward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens\n  the front door.

Here'll\n    be fine.\n\n  The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle\n  of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and\n  pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    What are you looking at?\n\n  The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes\n  the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I think he wanted you to tip him.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think\n    he had change for a hundred.\n\n  Edward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with\n  interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    You have a wife?  Girlfriend?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I have both.\n\n  Edward lifts the bottle out.

To her surprise, really\n  likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen\n  enormous strawberries.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Try a strawberry.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Why?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Because they bring out the flavor\n    of the champagne.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Jesus, you act like you're\n    seducing some Valley girl you\n    picked up in a dance club.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Vivian... the meter's running...\n    cooperate.\n\n  A moment.  She slowly eats a strawberry.  The juice of it stains\n  her lips.  Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip\n  of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry.  His eyes\n  haven't left her.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (softly)\n    You really are a very beautiful\n    girl.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (husky-voiced)\n    Just a romantic, that's you.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Yes...\n\n  Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Me too.\n\n  He's about to kiss her...\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Not on the lips.\n\n  He freezes.  She pulls his head down to her breast.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward and Vivian on the bed.  He is on his back, his shoulder\n  and head resting against the headboard.

Edward suddenly pulls her\n  violently to him, he rolls her over...\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward.  He stands there\n  quietly letting it wash over him.  He turns off the shower,\n  steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward stares.  His expensive clothes are on the floor,\n  haphazardly dropped everywhere.  Vivian's clothes, as tattered\n  as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair.  The\n  incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way.  He looks toward\n  the bed.  Vivian is fast asleep.  Her heavy makeup has long since\n  been rubbed off.  Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.\n\n  She looks like a sweet, gentle girl.  He stares at her a moment\n  longer.  He turns, goes into the living room.  Vivian opens her\n  eyes.  Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living\n  room chair.  He is reading contracts.\n\n<b>  EXT.

She leaves an envelope at the\n  front desk.\n\n  MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from\n  his office.  He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees\n  Vivian exit out the front door.  Vivian doesn't notice the odd\n  stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are\n  just entering.\n\n<b>  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than\n  a bit overwhelmed.  She passes store windows... and MORE STORE\n  WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS.  Each display is more\n  beautiful and expensive than the one before.\n\n  Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks.  From\n  PASSERBY'S.  Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at\n  her, turn away and giggle.  The uniformed GUARDS that stand at\n  attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her\n  suspiciously.\n\n  Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh\n  woman's boutique.  She hesitates for a moment.  She enters.\n\n<b>  INT.

You're obviously\n    in the wrong place.\n\n  Vivian is speechless.  She turns and stomps toward the door.\n  She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman.  Vivian\n  flips her off.  She throws the door open and storms outside.\n  The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns\n  to her place.\n\n<b>  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost.  She takes\n  a deep breath, trying to control herself.  Two WOMEN, in elegant\n  designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a\n  freak.  Vivian suddenly feels naked.  She turns and hurries\n  away.\n\n<b>  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid.  She feels\n  an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury\n  around her.  She hurries toward the elevators.\n\n  At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her.  He crosses\n  the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.\n\n<b>          MR.

She spots the\n  Operator.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (blurting it out)\n    He knows me.\n\n  Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.

But\n    as a friend, we're willing to\n    overlook it, I'm assuming you're\n    a... relative?\n\n  Vivian finds herself nodding.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    I thought so.

We understand one another.\n      (as a gentle\n       afterthought:)\n    I would also encourage you to\n    dress in a more appropriate\n    manner.\n\n  Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    That's what I was trying to do.\n\n  She can't help it, the tears come.

HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian.\n  And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the\n  beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress\n  at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian\n  rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You're late.\n\n  Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without\n  thinking:\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I'm sorry.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You're forgiven.\n\n  She waits expectantly.  He holds out an arm.  She takes it.\n\n<b>  INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Vivian comes out of the ladies room.  She walks forward past\n  the MAITRE'D'S station.  She stops.  She takes a breath... and\n  then walks forward.\n\n<b>  INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN\n</b>\n  Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant\n  restaurant toward a far table.  Her beauty and natural grace\n  draw approving stares.  She is like a queen moving through a\n  ballroom.\n\n  At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.\n  JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire\n  industrialist.  Sitting next to him is his son and second in\n  command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.\n  All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table.  David Kross\n  holds out Vivian's chair for her.  Surprised, she nods her\n  thanks.  In front of her is an enormous placesetting.  She\n  smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.\n\n  Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of\n  them.  Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork.  But then she\n  sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and\n  is digging into his salad with that.\n\n  Vivian looks to see what Edward will do.  He doesn't seem\n  interested in eating yet.  Neither does David Kross.  Feeling\n  a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    So young man, I understand you\n    are trying to take over my\n    company.\n\n  A moment.  The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for\n  a moment.  But then he almost smiles.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Please don't patronize me, Mr.\n    Kross.  Our ages mean nothing\n    here.\n\n  Kross and David look at each other.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>    Mr. Harris, we know you've\n    purchased at least twenty percent\n    of our stock.  We also know you\n    plan to file a formal bid for a\n    majority share.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Twenty-five percent.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    Mr. Harris, I built Kross\n    Enterprises myself.  I know every\n    man who ever worked there by his\n    first name.  I know their wives...\n    and their children.  If your\n    intention is to take over my\n    company and turn it into a\n    glorified real estate deal, think\n    again.\n\n  Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins\n  to eat.  Relieved, Vivian picks up hers.  They all eat for a\n  moment.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?\n\n  WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put\n  down the next course.  Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,\n  quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad.  She is\n  reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    What would it take to buy our\n    stock back?  Name your price.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    To get me in a mood to sell --\n    double what I paid.  But your\n    company doesn't have enough\n    capital right now to buy anything.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>    We're on the verge of closing\n    a large navy contract.  Double\n    is ridiculous but we can assure\n    you a healthy profit on your\n    shares.  We would give you a\n    promissory note...\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    You're not getting any navy\n    contracts.\n\n  Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this\n  news.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>    There's no way you could know\n    that.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    But I do know.  I also know your\n    lines of credit are over-extended.\n    If I don't buy your company,\n    someone else will...\n      (looking up)\n    Ah, the escargot.\n\n  Escargot are put down in front of everyone.  Vivian stares at\n  them dubiously.  She picks up what she assumes is the next\n  \"right\" fork.  She picks up a snail.  The two do not fit.\n  Flustered, she doesn't know what to do.  No one else seems to\n  be eating.  And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks\n  at each place.  Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (softly, to the Waiter)\n    Scume me, what are these things?\n\n<b>          WAITER\n</b>      (bending to whisper)\n    Escargot, mademoiselle.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (leaning close to\n       whisper)\n    Snails.\n\n  Vivian stares at them, horrified.  She, like James and David\n  Kross, no longer seem interested in eating.  Edward eats with\n  pleasure.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell\n    you my stock.  On the contrary,\n    I'm here to buy yours.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>      (angry)\n    You've got a lot of nerve.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    No.  What I have is a lot of\n    money.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    I know all about you, Mr. Harris.\n    When you buy companies, they have\n    a way of disappearing.  Even the\n    pension funds are stripped clean.\n    The last three companies you took\n    over were cut up in so many\n    pieces, widows were left without\n    their retirement checks.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (calmly)\n    What I did with those companies\n    was perfectly legal.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    I don't question the legality\n    of what you do.  It's your\n    morality that makes me sick.  I\n    will not allow my company to be\n    raped by a man like you.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (angry now)\n    It is not your company.  It's a\n    public company.  And I am going\n    to acquire it.  Either I buy from\n    the other stock holders, or I buy\n    from you.\n\n  Vivian struggles with her escargot.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    I would suggest that you and your\n    board cooperate with me, rather\n    than fight a battle you don't have\n    the ammunition to win.\n\n  Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone\n  looks to her.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Slippery little suckers...\n\n  Kross rises.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    If you'll excuse me young lady,\n    Mr. Harris...\n      (turns to David)\n    Deal with this, David, you know\n    where we stand.  I need to go\n    someplace and puke.\n\n  He rises.  He exits.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>      (to Edward and Vivian)\n    Men like my father built this\n    country.  He was no saint.  He\n    screwed people.

She begins to rub his shoulders.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    That... is very good.\n\n  A moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie,\n  unbuttons his collar.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Know what we're gonna do in a\n    little while then?

She look around\n  momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with\n  relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express\n  card on the pillow next to her.\n\n<b>          EDWARD (O.S.)\n</b>    Wake up, Vivian.

Edward shakes his hand.  The\n  Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.\n  Vivian scowls.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (sighing)\n    I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.\n\n<b>  INT.

She looks lovely in the pink\n  dress and new, white shoes.  A pretty, white hat is the final\n  touch.  She carries a bag containing her old clothes.  She stops\n  at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.\n\n<b>  INT.

She happily and confidently tries on\n  a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.\n\n  1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall.  She tosses a dress out\n  to a waiting SALESWOMAN.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Not me!\n\n  2)  A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (imitating Bridget)\n    Horrid!\n\n  3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps.\n  Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted\n  tie.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Where'd you get your tie?\n\n  4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the\n  Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over\n  his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and\n  smiles.\n\n<b>  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She\n  feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by,\n  smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores\n  him.\n\n  Suddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was\n  thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.\n\n<b>  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's\n  courage leaves her.\n\n  The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.\n\n<b>          SALESWOMAN\n</b>      (to the customer)\n    Isn't this lovely?  I think it\n    would look wonderful on you.\n\n  Vivian musters her courage.

It's me.\n    I want you to know something.\n    You made me feel terrible. I\n    wasn't dressed right and you said\n    I didn't belong here.  Well, I\n    do.  You're the one that was\n    wrong, not me.  And I want to tell\n    you something else.  I'm never\n    gonna shop here again as long as\n    I live.\n\n  And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.\n\n  The saleswoman is stunned.  A beat.  The customer thrusts the\n  dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's\n  speech and leaves the store also.\n\n<b>  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\n  Mr. Thomas looks up from the desk.  And stares.  Vivian and a\n  BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel\n  lobby to the elevator.  The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes\n  and shopping bags.  Mr. Thomas can't help it.  He smiles to\n  himself.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her\n  packages.  She motions for him to place them on the couch.  He\n  does.  Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill.  He\n  exits.  The door closes.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Wheee!!!\n\n  Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch.\n\n<b>  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  Stuckey enters.

He closes the door.  He turns.  And stops.  A\n  beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the\n  middle of the room.  Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.\n  A fire burns in the fireplace.  Music is playing.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN (O.S.)\n</b>    Hi.\n\n  Edward turns.  And stares again.  Vivian stands in the bedroom\n  doorway.  She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown.

What she has on underneath is\n  absolutely nothing.  Edward crosses to her.  Taking her in his\n  arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    What about dinner?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Dinner can wait.\n\n<b>  INT.

Vivian moves to him.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Edward, these women here, I don't\n    think any of'm like the guys\n    they're with.

They laugh.  Shoes get stuck in the\n  mud.  It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy\n  clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.\n  In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in\n  disbelief.\n\n  Vivian is having a wonderful time.  And then, as she moves\n  towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at\n  her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.\n  David Kross smiles at Vivian.

I picked her up\n    off Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n<b>  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN\n</b>\n  as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.  She turns.  She sees that\n  it's Stuckey laughing.

Edward looks up from his\n  conversation, sees her looking at him.  He smiles, raises his\n  glass in a small toast.  A moment.  Vivian toasts him back.\n\n<b>  INT.

Tell\n    me what happened.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Stuckey!  He wants an\n    \"appointment\" with me after you\n    leave.

Why should the\n    truth upset you?  It's not as if\n    you're from a convent.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    I want my fucking money.  I'm\n    getting out of here.  I don't want\n    anything more to do with you.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Can we talk about this?  Can you\n    just try to calm down?\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Your goddamned friend, he thinks\n    the only reason I'm with you is\n    for the money.\n\n  A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (defiantly)\n    Well, it's true.

If you want\n    the clothes, pack them up.\n\n  Vivian stands quietly for a moment.  And then she turns and\n  walks into the bedroom.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light\n  of the bedroom.  As she does she starts crying.  With each item\n  of clothing the tears come down harder.  Edward appears at the\n  doorway.  His face is genuinely concerned.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't\n    prepared for questions about us.\n    It was an idiotic and insensitive\n    thing I did.

It doesn't hurt\n    you when somebody pisses on you,\n    it just pissed you off.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I really am sorry.\n\n  Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms.  Sobbing, she stands\n  limply.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    You hurt me.\n\n  Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders.\n  She touches his hand.  He sits on the bed.  He pulls her to him\n  and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I'll make it up to you.\n\n<b>  INT.

PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n  Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing\n  an elegant red sequined evening dress.  She looks incredibly\n  beautiful.  She sees the phone.  A thought occurs to her and\n  going to it, she picks it up.  Waits.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    C'mon, Kit...\n\n  No answer.  She hears someone at the door.  She hangs up.\n  Edward enters.

Edward is holding a diamond and ruby\n  necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he\n  breathed too hard.  Edward behind Vivian, fastens the\n  necklace around her neck.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    This is made for a princess.\n    I think she'd approve of you\n    wearing it tonight.

It is a comfortable room\n  featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in\n  bar, television and stereo.  Edward is once again, going over\n  papers.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    I've never been on a plane\n    before.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I'm glad you like it.

A wicked gleam comes to her eye.\n\n  She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him.  He looks\n  up.  She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken\n  quarters.  She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Vivian, what do you think you're\n    doing?\n\n  Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Being quiet.\n\n  She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face.

Once.\n    First time I ever ran away from\n    home, I got as far as Atlanta.\n    I met this boy.  He'd been with\n    his parents on their way to\n    Chicago.  They stopped at a gas\n    station.  He went to the john.\n    When he came back they'd split.\n    We sorta started looking out for\n    each other.  Aw, he was sweet.\n    And boy, was he good looking,\n    y'know, dark hair and eyes.\n    The chicken hawks were on him all\n    the time.  He hated that.\n    Sometimes we'd find a safe place\n    to crash nights and we'd curl up\n    together and we'd talk about all\n    these crazy things.  The two of\n    us getting married someday.\n    Having kids.  Stupid stuff.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    What happened to him?\n\n  A moment.

You can always tell\n    when someone goes to the opera\n    for the first time.  They either\n    love it or hate it.  Those who\n    love it will always love it; those\n    who hate it might come to\n    appreciate it, but they'll never\n    truly love it.\n\n  Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit\n  fountain with several graceful statues in its center.\n  Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and\n  prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without\n  realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace.\n  She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and\n  steal it.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Viv?  I really doubt if anyone\n    here is going to try and grab it.\n\n  Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.\n\n<b>  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their\n  seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes\n  -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative\n  glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her\n  necklace.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    They all think you look very\n    beautiful, Vivian.\n\n  Vivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand\n  from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She\n  takes it.  They start forward.\n\n<b>  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the\n  stage.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    If it's in Italian, how will I\n    know what they're saying?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I'll whisper some of the main\n    parts of the story to you.  But\n    you'll be surprised how much you\n    understand.  The music conveys\n    the story more powerfully than\n    any words.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    But don't they have it in\n    English?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Vivian, don't be afraid of what\n    you don't know.  That's the fun\n    of it.\n\n  The lights dim.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (resigned)\n    Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm\n    glad you brought me.\n\n  The orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely\n  on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.\n\n<b>  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.\n\n  The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward\n  leans over to translate the tenor's aria.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    What am I?  I am a poet.  Not\n    a man of wealth but one rich in\n    dreams.  You have come to replace\n    my vanished dreams.  I dwell now\n    only in your eyes.\n\n  The MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The\n  story continues.\n\n  Edward again leans close to Vivian.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    And now she asks Rudolpho if he\n    still thinks her beautiful --\n\n  Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes\n  are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help.\n\n  The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is\n  reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill\n  with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long\n  moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.\n  Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.\n\n  As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.\n\n<b>  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT\n</b>\n  As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined\n  mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile\n  at her.\n\n<b>          OLDER WOMAN\n</b>    Did you enjoy the opera, dear?\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (tearfully)\n    It was so beautiful I just about\n    pissed my pants.\n\n  Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he\n  and the still misty Vivian exit.\n\n<b>  INT.

I'm glad.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Did you?\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more.\n    Thank you.\n\n  Vivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward\n  she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise.\n  He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the\n  first time they've kissed and they make it very special.\n\n<b>  EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The plane flies in the night.  Back to L.A.\n\n<b>  INT.

PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\n  In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together.\n  Edward cradles Vivian.  Her back rests against his chest.  His\n  arm is over her body.\n\n  She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines\n  it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back.  She\n  gently kisses the palm.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Love you...\n\n  She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast.  She closes\n  her eyes, ready to sleep now.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n  His eyes open.  Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with\n  him with sudden confusion and uncertainty.  He stares into the\n  dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING\n</b>\n  The phone rings.  Edward immediately reaches out and picks it\n  up.  He is dressed in a robe.  Breakfast is on the umbrella'd\n  table in front of him.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Yes?\n\n<b>  INT.

Listen, if he's\n    really caving in, we'll go from\n    there down to the office.  I want\n    him to commit his stock to us this\n    morning.\n\n  Edward hangs up.  His mind seems on other things.  He rises.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n  Vivian is still asleep.  She is face down on the bed, the\n  sheets just covering her to her waist.  Edward stares down at\n  her.  He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line\n  of her spine.  Vivian murmurs contentedly.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Mmm.\n      (opening her eyes;\n       looking at him)\n    Hi.\n\n  Edward smiles at her softly.  And then:\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Better get dressed.  We're having\n    guests.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  Vivian is wearing her yellow dress.  She stares at herself in\n  the bedroom mirror.  Her hair... her make-up... she realizes\n  how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.\n\n  Edward comes out of the bathroom.  He crosses to the closet\n  for a tie.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Here.  Let me.\n\n  She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him.  He is very\n  aware of the closeness of her.  She smiles at him.  He smiles;\n  puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment.  Looking up,\n  she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes.  He releases\n  her hand.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>      (quietly)\n    One more night and you're finally\n    rid of me.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Yeah, you've been pretty tough\n    to take.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I have to go to New York\n    tomorrow.\n\n  Vivian says nothing.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    But I'll be back in Los Angeles.\n    Soon.

An arrangement.\n\n  Vivian is silent.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    I'll get you an apartment, buy\n    you a car --\n\n  Vivian sighs, letting something go inside.  Finished with his\n  tie, she turns away.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    What is it?\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (not unkindly)\n    What else?

This is the best solution.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (shakes her head \"no,\"\n       then continues tying\n       his tie)\n    When I was a little girl, my\n    mother locked me in the attic when\n    I was bad, which was pretty often.\n    I'd stare out the window up there\n    and make believe I was a princess\n    trapped in the tower by the wicked\n    queen.  Then suddenly a knight\n    on a white horse with his bright\n    colors flying would ride up.\n    Rescue me from the tower, and then\n    we'd ride off... but never, ever\n    in all the times I had that dream\n    did the knight say, \"Come on baby,\n    I'll put you up in a great condo.\"\n\n  She finished his tie.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (softly; to herself)\n    I know.\n      (a beat)\n    Hey, don't mind me.

It's\n    a real good offer for a whore.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I've never treated you like a\n    whore.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>      (not mean)\n    You just did.\n\n  The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.\n\n<b>  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  Edward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind\n  him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters.\n  He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask\n  his surprise.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    Mr. Harris.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    How are you, Mr. Kross.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    Not bad for a man who hasn't\n    slept in four nights.  I'll get\n    used to it.\n\n  An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.\n  Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another\n  perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes\n  the door and leads them all down the stairs.\n\n  Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods\n  at Vivian.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    Young lady.\n\n<b>          VIVIAN\n</b>    Hello.\n      (to David)\n    Hi.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>    Hello, Vivian.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Let's not waste time here, shall\n    we?

He is surprised to\n  see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.\n  Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second\n  thoughts.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    I'll see you on one condition.\n    I'm not so concerned for me but\n    the people who have worked for\n    me...\n\n  Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>      (quickly)\n    They'll be taken care of.  Won't\n    they, Edward?\n\n  Kross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly\n  nods.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    I'll sign anything you want then.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Today.\n\n  Kross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft.\n\n<b>          KROSS\n</b>    Today.\n\n  Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,\n  obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates.\n  He turns to Kross:\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    Excuse me, please?\n\n  He heads to the bedroom.\n\n<b>  INT.

There is something\n  about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just\n  seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of\n  the story.\n\n  Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.

Edward is silent; indeed\n  it's as if something is twisting inside of him.

Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing\n  back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the\n  force of another slap.

Edward rushes forward, berserk\n  with rage, to hit Stuckey again.  His fist hits the top of\n  Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.\n\n  Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries\n  to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into\n  the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again\n  tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're\n  not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    You broke my nose.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    I think I broke my hand.\n      (a beat)\n    You're fired.\n\n<b>          STUCKEY\n</b>    Edward, we've been together ten\n    years.\n\n<b>          EDWARD\n</b>    And I don't like what we've\n    become.

Edward comes forward and sweeps\n  her into his arms.  They kiss.\n\n  He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless.  Her feet\n  never touch the ground.\n\n  The car door closes behind them.  The limo drives away.\n\n  The people of the street watch it go.\n\n<b>          THE END\n</b>\n<b>  --------------------------------------------------------------\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Pretty Woman</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=J.F.
