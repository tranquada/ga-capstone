A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n\n  The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house\n  is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.\n\n  A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins\n  appear and disappear in his nimble hands.\n\n  INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT\n\n    EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down\n  at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around\n  forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured\n  by a night's sleep.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a murmur)\n    Left pocket.\n\n  And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the\n  left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More\n  laughter and applause.\n\n  The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious.\n  Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,\n  is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an\n  investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial\n  researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are\n  in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of\n  documents and folders, the name \"KROSS INDUSTRIES\" is prominent\n  on many of the folders.\n\n          INVESTMENT BANKER 1\n    Our banks certainly doesn't want\n    to discourage Harris Enterprises\n    from investing in California.\n    We think this is a great new venue\n    for you but you've got to\n    understand the mergers and\n    acquisitions market is changing.\n    With the upswing in inflation we\n    have to make these offerings\n    tempting to offset the risk.\n\n          VANCE\n    Look, we're talking about hard\n    assets and a straight liquidation.\n    We have over a thousand man hours\n    in this deal.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (losing patience)\n    This is a \"no brainer\".  There's\n    no risk for you.  No one has ever\n    lost money backing Mr. Harris.\n\n          INVESTMENT BANKER 2\n    Not yet.  But ship building is\n    a new endeavor for you...\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (cuts him off)\n    Come on.  You know we're not\n    going to go into ship building.\n    Besides, you're the ones with the\n    troubled track record, not us!\n\n          INVESTMENT BANKER 3\n    Bill, be reasonable.  If you're\n    really going to digest Kross\n    Industries that quickly eighteen\n    should not be such a problem.\n    Besides, I don't think there's\n    anywhere else you can go for the\n    money in the time you have.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It's unacceptable.\n\n  Edward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All\n  eyes are on him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Draymen Heux has offered me\n    seventy-five in the pool at\n    sixteen and a half.  I can secure\n    the other half personally.  You\n    have until tomorrow morning to\n    make me a better offer.\n\n  The bankers speechlessly stare at him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    The meeting is over, gentlemen.\n\n  He turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise.\n  Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes\n  with laughter.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Hah!  Did you see the look on\n    their faces?\n\n          VANCE\n    You don't think we pushed too\n    hard?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    NO way!  They'll come back.  They\n    can't afford not to.  Edward,\n    that bluff was beautiful.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Maybe I should have made it\n    rhyme.\n\n  The others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The\n  others follow suit.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (looking at his watch)\n    Well!  It's late.  We've been\n    at this long enough.\n\n  Stuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The\n    magician's wonderful.\n\n  Vance and Jake exit.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (calling after them)\n    Watch your left pocket.\n\n  A BUTLER has entered the room.\n\n          BUTLER\n    Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss\n    Charles.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Cynthia?  Is she coming out?\n\n          EDWARD\n    We're about to find out.  Go on.\n    Take care of your guests.\n\n  Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into phone)\n    Where are you, Cynthia?\n      (beat)\n    I see.\n      (pausing, getting angry)\n    No, I don't expect you to be at\n    my beck-and-call.  Are you coming\n    or not?\n\n  INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n\n  Edward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in\n  tow.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (all business)\n    Prepare the filing papers.  Have\n    them ready by the middle of the\n    week.  I'll tell you when to\n    submit them.\n\n  The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate\n  toward Edward.\n\n          A MAN\n    Edward!\n\n          EDWARD\n      (turning on the charm)\n    Yes!\n\n          THE MAN\n    Will we see you at the polo\n    matches Wednesday?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Wouldn't miss it.\n      (abruptly; to Vance)\n    I want this done fast and easy.\n    No slip-ups.  I want to be back\n    in New York by Saturday.  Got it?\n\n  He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.\n\n  INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT\n\n  Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful\n  WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress.  An elegant woman\n      ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on\n  the shoulder and he turns, startled.\n\n          ELIZABETH\n    Bill?\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (flustered)\n    Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,\n    uh, uh, Millicent.\n\n          MILLICENT\n    Lowell.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Lowell, right.  My wife,\n    Elizabeth.\n\n          ELIZABETH\n      (ignoring her)\n    Is Edward leaving?\n\n  Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.\n  Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.\n\n  EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n  Edward comes out of the house.  Jags, a limo with waiting\n  DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black\n  Ferrari.  The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of\n  Edward.  Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his\n  impatience under control.  Stuckey comes out of the house and\n  down the walk.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    What's up, where you going?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Give me your car keys, will you,\n    I'm going back to my hotel.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    At least stay for a drink.  This\n    party's for you.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Apologize to Elizabeth for me.\n\n  Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Listen, there're some major local\n    talent inside just dying to meet\n    you...\n\n          EDWARD\n      (as if delighted)\n    Really?  Some high class gold\n    digger who speaks French better\n    than I do?\n      (turning away)\n    No, thank you.  I just got off\n    the phone with one.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Cynthia's not coming?\n\n          EDWARD\n    No.\n\n  Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.  He crosses to a\n  black Ferrari and gets in.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Let your driver take you.  We'll\n    move the cars...\n\n  Edward starts the car.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Can you drive a stick?\n\n  The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly\n  stalls.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Edward, give me a break!\n\n  With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway\n  and... stalls again.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Love this car!  Is it new?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Yes!  And you don't even know\n    where you're going!\n\n  Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.  Stuckey\n  watching, throws up his hands.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    That's the wrong way!\n\n  CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n\n  The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes\n  large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n\n  The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.\n  The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.\n  Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.  The light turns\n  green.  Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.  The Colt leaves\n  him in the dust.\n\n  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT\n\n  Edward drives.  He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid\n  himself of his own tired thoughts.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT\n\n  The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,\n  stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street\n  signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back\n  in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.\n\n  EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT\n\n  A crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted\n  parking lot.\n\n  The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,\n  looking very out of place on the street.\n\n  PANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire\n  escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a\n  short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away.\n\n  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n  A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.\n\n  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n  VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom\n  mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up\n  applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.\n  She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny\n  shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at\n  herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs,\n  turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.\n\n  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n  Faded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks\n  the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.\n  A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously\n  pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig\n  eyes.\n\n          LANDLORD\n    Vivian.\n\n  Vivian turns some \"tough\" on him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, what?\n\n          LANDLORD\n    Rent.  You're late.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Don't give me that.  Kit gave it\n    to you yesterday, cash.\n\n          LANDLORD\n    Kit give me nothin'.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (suddenly uncertain)\n    You bullshittin' me?\n\n          LANDLORD\n    Of rent I do not bullshit.\n\n  Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.\n\n          LANDLORD\n    By the end of the week or you're\n    otta here.\n      (a beat)\n    By the way, you look very nice\n    tonight!\n\n  INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN\n\n  Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top.\n  It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She\n  opens it.\n\n  INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n  Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open\n  doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up.\n\n  Vivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with\n  them.\n\n  EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried\n  away.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.\n\n  A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.\n  He wears an \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt.\n\n  Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than\n  she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle\n  in a doorway.\n\n  A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little\n  bags to various STREET-TYPES.\n\n  A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists\n  to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie\n  star.  Some go in.\n\n  Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.\n  A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car\n  passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores\n  him.  The black prostitute approaches the car.\n\n          PROSTITUTE\n    Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?\n\n  The Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the\n  car and it drives away.\n\n  A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night\n  coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS\n  as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into\n  a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.\n\n  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT\n\n  Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks\n  frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the\n  shop.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Chan, you seen Kit tonight?\n\n          COOK 1\n    Hi, hi!  No see nothing.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You do, tell her I'm looking for\n    her.\n\n          COOK 2\n    Looking good, bay-bee.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit\n    comes in here, tell her stay.\n\n  Both of them nod and smile at Vivian.  Vivian exits.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n\n  Skateboard zips by a GROUP.  We SEE a police car parked at the\n  entrance to an alcove.  Also, an ambulance.  The bubblegum\n  lights are going.  A CROWD has gathered.  The happy man with\n  the \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged\n  in tense conversation.\n\n          COP\n    They just pulled her out of a\n    dumpster in the back.  Now talk\n    to me.\n\n          MAN\n    I tell you, man, I don't know who\n    she hang with.\n\n          COP\n    She have a pimp?\n\n          MAN\n    Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a\n    strawberry.  She be out on these\n    streets, day in, day out, tradin'\n    her sorry ass for crack.  And\n    now she dead from it.\n\n  Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body\n  of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried\n  towards the waiting ambulance.  For a moment Vivian thinks\n  it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.\n\n  Vivian surveys the dark street.  And suddenly sees who's she's\n  looking for.  Walks.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT\n\n  We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.\n  The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.  The\n  girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.  The young\n  man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.\n  They giggle about something, both obviously high.  Kit looks\n  up, bleary-eyed.  She stops.  Vivian is standing in front of\n  her.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You spent it on drugs, didn't you?\n\n          KIT\n    Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my\n    roommate, Viv.\n\n          CARLOS\n    Lookin' good, baby.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (ignoring him)\n    Did you blow it all, Kit?  Is it\n    all gone?\n\n          KIT\n    Carlos had some great rock.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I bet.\n      (beat)\n    That was our rent!\n\n  Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders.\n\n          CARLOS\n    Calm down, Chica.\n\n  Vivian throws him off.\n\n          CARLOS\n    Ey!  What is it you wan', baby?\n    I can fix you up.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Beat it, scum bucket!\n\n          CARLOS\n    You kiss your mother with that\n    mouth?  Your frien' still owes\n    me 200.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (to Kit)\n    Let's go.\n\n  Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Get out of my face or I'll have\n    those cops on your ass in two\n    seconds.\n\n  Carlos glares at her.  He looks down toward the lights of the\n  cop cars.  One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.\n  Vivian waves at the cop.\n\n          CARLOS\n      (threatening to Vivian)\n    Don't take no dates tonight,\n    chica, you got one with me.\n\n  Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.\n\n  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea.  Vivian is still\n  mad at her.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    We worked for that money.  We\n    were gonna put together enough\n    to get out of that dump we live\n    in, get off this street.\n\n          KIT\n    Viv... don't be stupid.  We're\n    whores.\n\n  Vivian looks like she wants to weep.  Or scream.  She does\n  neither.  She slowly nods.  Kit's sorry she said that.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    So I blew our stash.  We could\n    make it all back with one good\n    night on the streets.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I just saw somebody pulled out\n    of a dumpster.  I wonder how much\n    she made tonight?\n\n          KIT\n    Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay\n    you back.  I promise.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I thought you were giving up that\n    drug shit.\n\n          KIT\n    I will.

Okay?\n\n          KIT\n    Okay.\n      (then touches her hand)\n    I'm sorry I said your dream was\n    stupid.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n\n  Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of\n  the Hollywood Hills.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars.\n  Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop.  Kit is talking to\n  another prostitute, RACHEL.\n\n          KIT\n    No no, honey.  You see these\n    stars on the sidewalk.  Me and\n    Vivian work from Don Ameche all\n    the way up to Roy Rogers.\n    This is our office.  We got\n    seniority.  Get off our corner.\n\n          RACHEL\n    I was just taking a rest here.\n    Besides, she's new.\n      (points to Vivian)\n\n          KIT\n    But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty\n    Hall or Debra Paget where you\n    belong.\n\n  Rachel walks off.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (looks at passing cars)\n    Looks slow tonight.\n\n          KIT\n    Maybe we should get a pimp.\n    Carlos likes you and --\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Forget it.

There isn't even\n    milk in the fridge.  The rent's\n    due.  Now come on --\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n      (suddenly)\n    Hey, hey -- There's a rent.\n\n  EXT.

And\n    remember, don't mouth off.  They\n    don't like that.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy\n    on that shit.\n\n  Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.\n\n          KIT\n    You're the greatest.  I'll wait\n    up for you.\n\n  And then Kit is off, moving quickly away.  Vivian turns.  She\n  stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And\n  then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of\n  hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and\n  sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.\n\n  In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious\n  and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?\n\n          EDWARD\n    What's that?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You looking' for some company?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Uh, no.

Can you tell me how to\n    get to Beverly Hills?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Sure.  For five bucks.\n\n          EDWARD\n    That's ridiculous.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    The price just went up to ten.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Why don't you just do it out of\n    the kindness of your heart?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (sweetly)\n    Sit... and spin.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Sit-and-spin.\n      (amused)\n    Alright... why not?\n\n  He pulls out his money clip.\n\n  Vivian suddenly freezes.  On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and\n  Skateboard.  Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin.  He motions\n  to Skateboard, they start forward.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (holding up a bill)\n    You have change for a twenty.\n\n  Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    For twenty, Ill show you\n    personal.  Drive.\n\n  Edward stares at her.  She smiles sweetly.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Make a \"U-ee\".  Beverly Hills\n    is the other way.\n\n  The Ferrari pulls away, passing Carlos on the sidewalk.\n\n  INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Nice car.

Vivian smiles back.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Mind if I turn on some heat?\n\n          EDWARD\n    If you can figure it out, be my\n    guest.\n\n  Vivian reaches out, turns on the heat.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Very good.

It hits him that she really is\n  an attractive girl.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What's your name?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What do you want it to be?\n      (a beat)\n    Vivian, my name's Vivian.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You like being a hooker, Vivian?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It pays.\n\n          EDWARD\n    So do day jobs.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (sarcastic)\n    Day jobs, yeah.

FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT\n\n          EDWARD\n    Must be dangerous.  Hooking.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Tell me about it.  L.A. is\n    suffering from a wacko epidemic.\n    And who knows where half the guys\n    I pick up have been.  I mean, I\n    use condoms.  Always.  And I get\n    checked out once a month at the\n    free clinic.  Not only am I better\n    in the sack than an amateur, I'm\n    probably safer.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Very good.  You ought to have\n    that printed up on your business\n    card.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (a moment)\n    If you're making fun of me, I\n    don't like it.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean\n    to.\n\n  Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Ugly habit, biting your nails.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You don't know habits, you think\n    this is ugly.\n\n  But she puts her hands in her lap.  She looks out the window.\n  She's safe from Carlos.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Okay, pull over.  Let me out.\n    I've got to get back to work.\n\n  Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Stay on this street and you'll\n    hit Beverly Hills.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What do you charge for company,\n    Vivian?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Company would cost you... a\n    hundred dollars.\n\n          EDWARD\n    For the whole night?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    For an hour.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're joking.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I never joke about money.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Neither do I.\n      (a moment; amused)\n    A hundred bucks an hour though.\n    That's pretty stiff.\n\n  She reaches across the seat.  Her hand goes in his lap.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    No, but it's getting there.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, how much to put up with\n    me for the entire night?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You couldn't afford it.\n\n  Vivian starts to get out of the car.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Try me.\n\n  A moment.

This side.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What?\n\n          EDWARD\n    You know how to drive a stick?\n\n  Vivian moves around the car.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Better believe it.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Then let's go.  It's worth 300\n    just so I don't have to drive.\n\n  They get in the car.\n\n  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT\n\n  She starts the car, revs it.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Here we go Edward.\n\n  EXT.

REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n  Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the\n  Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel.  Bright flags are illuminated\n  by carefully placed spotlights.  The Ferrari SCREAMS into the\n  driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door.\n\n  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT\n\n  Edward takes a moment to get his breath.  He gestures toward\n  the back.\n\n          EDWARD\n    My raincoat's in the back.  Put\n    it on.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Why?\n\n          EDWARD\n    You may feel more comfortable.\n    This is not the kind of place that\n    rents rooms by the hour.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You mean they don't have hookers.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Every place has hookers, but if\n    this hotel has hookers, they don't\n    look like they're...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Off the boulevard.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Exactly.\n\n  INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n  As they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Great.  Now I took like a hooker\n    in a trenchcoat.\n\n  She looks up.  She stops in her tracks.  The lobby is bright\n  and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling.  Even at\n  this hour there is a great deal of activity.  MEN in business\n  suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by.  Vivian's\n  face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of\n  all this luxury.  Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes\n  Edward's arm.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    So let's go.\n\n  Edward guides them across the lobby.  They reach the elevators\n  and go inside.\n\n  INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\n  The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform\n  that seems just a bit too tight.  As the elevator doors close\n  he nods toward Edward.\n\n          OPERATOR\n    Evening, sir.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Good evening.  Penthouse.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Penthouse.  My, my.\n\n  She sees the operator glancing at her.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    The penthouse.  And step on it.\n\n  INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n  Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway\n  leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors.  Edward\n  pulls out his key and unlocks the doors.  With a gentle push\n  the door slide open in unison.  Edward gestures to Vivian to\n  go inside.  She does.  Edward closes the doors behind her.\n\n  INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n  As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling\n  off the top of the building.  In front of her is a sunken living\n  room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the\n  city below.  For the first time, she is speechless.  Edward\n  closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living\n  room.  Edward picks up a phone.  Vivian checks out the room.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into the phone)\n    Room service.\n      (to Vivian)\n    What do you drink?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Diet coke.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into the phone)\n    Send up a bottle of Crystal\n    champagne.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Can I have some chips?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into the phone)\n    -- and a bowl of strawberries.\n    Thank you.\n\n  Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room.  She\n  stares at the view.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (to Vivian)\n    Impressed?\n\n  Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You kidding?  I come here all the\n    time.  As a matter of fact they\n    do rent this room by the hour.\n\n  Edward smiles.  He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans\n  back.  Vivian looks at him.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Well, now that you have me for\n    the night, what are you going to\n    do with me?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Want to know something?  I don't\n    quite know.  I hadn't planned\n    this.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Do you plan everything?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a small smile)\n    Always.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Well, the meter's running, it's\n    your money.  Speaking of which,\n    cash'll do.  In advance.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Fair enough.\n\n  He rises.  Takes out his wallet.  Standing over her, he drops\n  THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She\n  picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.\n  She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is\n  standing over her as if waiting.\n\n  She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly\n  turns away.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Let's talk some more first.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Right.\n      (brightly)\n    So!  In town on business?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (taking off his jacket)\n    Uh-huh.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (loosening his tie)\n    And why do you say that?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (a small smile)\n    I dunno... you have that sharp,\n    useless look.\n\n  Edward almost smiles.  He sits across from her again.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Sounds like you've known a lot\n    of lawyers.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I've known a lot of everybody.\n\n  A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Champagne.\n\n  He starts to sit up.  Vivian motions for him to stay put.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hey.  I might as well make myself\n    useful.\n\n  Edward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens\n  the front door.  A WAITER comes into the room with a silver\n  cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.\n\n          WAITER\n    Where would you like it?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Where would we like it?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Where would we like it?  Here'll\n    be fine.\n\n  The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle\n  of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and\n  pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What are you looking at?\n\n  The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes\n  the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I think he wanted you to tip him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think\n    he had change for a hundred.\n\n  Edward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with\n  interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    You have a wife?  Girlfriend?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I have both.\n\n  Edward lifts the bottle out.  He deftly pops the cork on the\n  bottle without losing a drop of champagne.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Where are they?  Shopping\n    together?\n\n          EDWARD\n    They should be.  They're both good\n    at it.\n\n  Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and\n  hands one to Vivian.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    My ex-wife lives in London in what\n    used to be my home.\n    My girlfriend is in New York\n    moving out of my apartment even\n    as we speak.  Cheers.\n\n  He drinks, nods approvingly.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It's a very good year.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Oooh, thank god.\n\n  Edward laughs softly.  She sips it.  To her surprise, really\n  likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen\n  enormous strawberries.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Try a strawberry.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Why?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Because they bring out the flavor\n    of the champagne.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Jesus, you act like you're\n    seducing some Valley girl you\n    picked up in a dance club.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian... the meter's running...\n    cooperate.\n\n  A moment.  She slowly eats a strawberry.  The juice of it stains\n  her lips.  Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip\n  of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry.  His eyes\n  haven't left her.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (softly)\n    You really are a very beautiful\n    girl.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (husky-voiced)\n    Just a romantic, that's you.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes...\n\n  Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Me too.\n\n  He's about to kiss her...\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Not on the lips.\n\n  He freezes.  She pulls his head down to her breast.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n  Edward and Vivian on the bed.  He is on his back, his shoulder\n  and head resting against the headboard.  She is astride him,\n  hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident...\n  very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ANGLE ON THEIR FACES - NIGHT\n\n          EDWARD\n      (touching her breasts)\n    What do you like?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    If I want you to turn me on I'll\n    pay you three hundred.  Just lay\n    back and let me drive.\n\n  Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him.  He tries not\n  to groan.  She's moving faster now.  Edward suddenly pulls her\n  violently to him, he rolls her over...\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT\n\n  A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward.  He stands there\n  quietly letting it wash over him.  He turns off the shower,\n  steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n  Edward stares.  His expensive clothes are on the floor,\n  haphazardly dropped everywhere.  Vivian's clothes, as tattered\n  as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair.  The\n  incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way.  He looks toward\n  the bed.  Vivian is fast asleep.  Her heavy makeup has long since\n  been rubbed off.  Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.\n\n  She looks like a sweet, gentle girl.  He stares at her a moment\n  longer.  He turns, goes into the living room.  Vivian opens her\n  eyes.  Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living\n  room chair.  He is reading contracts.\n\n  EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNING\n\n  The sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk\n  in front of the hotel.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING\n\n  A WOMAN EMPLOYEE is vacuuming the lobby.  She sees something\n  and pauses.  She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted\n  plants.\n\n  INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING\n\n  The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the\n  hallway.  He takes it to the doors of the penthouse.  He rings\n  the bell.\n\n          EDWARD (O.S.)\n    It's open.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING\n\n  The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and\n  orange juice.  Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and\n  suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless\n  phone.  Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into the phone)\n    Sorry.  Go ahead.\n\n  INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - MORNING - INTERCUT\n\n  William Stuckey is behind his desk.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Kross knows we're after his\n    company.  He wants to talk with\n    you.  I don't think you should.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING\n\n  The Waiter returns.  Edward signs the bill.  The Waiter exits.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I want to.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Edward, if the three of us sit\n    down together we might as well\n    announce our plans in the Wall\n    Street Journal.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll see him alone.  Everyone\n    knows you're my muscle.  We'll\n    make it social.  Tell Kross I'll\n    meet him for dinner.  Tonight if\n    you can arrange it.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    You shouldn't go alone.  He might\n    claim that you tried to black mail\n    him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Bill, we're businessmen, not the\n    damn mafia.  I'll see you in the\n    office.  By the way, about your\n    car...\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Oh, god, what?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (smiling)\n    I'll bring it back.\n\n  Edward hangs up.  He pours a glass of orange juice and takes\n  a sip, thinking.  Something makes him turn.  Vivian, wearing\n  a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the\n  bedroom doorway.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Good morning.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You didn't wake me.  I'll be out\n    of here in a minute.\n\n          EDWARD\n    No hurry.  Would you like some\n    breakfast?\n\n  She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Only if you do.\n\n  Edward sits.  Waits.  Vivian sits across from him.  Edward\n  serves them breakfast.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Did you sleep well?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where\n    I was.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Occupational hazard?\n\n  She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense,\n  relaxes.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Where'd you go?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I took the couch.  I had some work\n    to do.\n      (hesitating)\n    About last night...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Oooh, Baby, you were the best.\n    I was beside myself.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Mmm, I could tell.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I just hope it was worth three\n    hundred bucks.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'd say you give a good dollar\n    value.\n\n  They share a small smile.  They eat.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Do you ever... enjoy it?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I like guys if that's what you're\n    asking.  Not that I trust'm.\n\n          EDWARD\n    No?  Why's that?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    \"Occupational hazard\".\n\n  A moment.  Edward chuckles.  Vivian grins.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    what do you do anyway?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I buy companies.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    No shit.  They expensive?\n\n  He almost smiles.  She almost smiles back.\n\n          EDWARD\n    The one I'm buying this week will\n    cost around 150 million.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    ... dollars?\n\n  He nods.  This time Vivian is impressed.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    You are major league, baby.  Your\n    mother must be very proud.\n\n  Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY\n\n  The closet door is open.  Edward reaches for a tie.  In the\n  closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes,\n  etc.  She follows him in.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    So what a ya do with the companies\n    once you buy'm?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (fumbling with the tie)\n    I sell them.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What?  Why?\n\n  She undoes his knot and starts over.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    At ease, let me do that.  Part\n    of the all night services.\n\n          EDWARD\n    By breaking up a company's assets\n    --\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What are assets?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian --\n\n          VIVIAN\n    C'mon, I might buy a company some\n    day.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Assets are anything of value a\n    company owns.  Sometimes the\n    pieces are worth more than the\n    whole.  By selling them off, I\n    make a profit.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Sorta like stealing cars and\n    selling'm for parts, huh?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Not... quite.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    There, see?  Now the emblem is\n    right in the middle of the knot.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Where'd you learn to do this?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (sarcastic)\n    I fucked the debate team in high\n    school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa.\n    He liked ties on Sundays.  You\n    mind if I take a swim in your\n    bathtub before I hit it?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Don't drown.\n\n  Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom.  He follows her\n  into the bathroom.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian turns on the water in the tub.  It fills the tub in a\n  torrential rush.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You could hold a pep rally in\n    here!\n\n  The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings.  Edward\n  reaches for it.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (into the phone)\n    Yes.\n\n  INT.  STUCKEY'S HOUSE - INTERCUT\n\n  Stuckey is walking around his desk.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Edward, it's me.  Kross is all\n    set for tonight.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian stares curiously at the bidet.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Listen, I gotta say this again,\n    I don't like you going alone.\n\n  She turns it on.  The water hits her in the face.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (stifling a chuckle)\n    I'm a big boy.\n\n  There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of\n  the tub.  Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Let me at least get you a date.\n    Keep it social.\n\n  Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath.  She smiles.\n  Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...?  He nods.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Edward, did you hear me?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm here.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    I know a lot of nice girls.\n\n  Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water.  There's\n  something about the look on her face... the way she bites her\n  lower lip... curious, sensual...\n\n          EDWARD\n    I have one.\n\n  Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the\n  television.  The sound blares.  She fumbles to turn it down.\n  Edward reaches over and turns it off.\n\n          EDWARD\n    All right.  How much for the week?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm in town until Saturday.\n\n  She look at him like he isn't speaking English.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Do-you-want-to-stay-here-\n    for-the-week?\n\n  It takes Vivian a moment to respond.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It'd cost you.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Of course.  How much?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Five full nights... days too?\n\n  Edward nods.  Vivian hesitates... it's got to be enough to\n  really change things... She shoots for the moon again.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Four thousand.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, may I point out five more\n    nights at three hundred a night\n    is only 1,500.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    But you want days too.\n\n          EDWARD\n    All right, two thousand.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Three.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Done.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Holy shit.\n\n  And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on\n  the sexy smile.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Sugar, you got it.  I will treat\n    you like a prince.  Anything,\n    anyway you want.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm not just talking about sex.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Look butthead, I'll treat you so\n    nice you'll never want to let me\n    go, okay?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Three thousand for five days.\n    And Vivian, I will let you go.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n  Edward comes out into the bedroom.  Vivian quickly follows.\n  They move through the bedroom into the living room.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll be out most of the day.\n\n  He reaches into his pocket for a money clip.  He peels off\n  bills.  He hands the cash to Vivian.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I want you to go out and buy some\n    decent clothes.\n\n  Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.\n    Conservative.  Understand?\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY\n\n  They're at the front door.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, you want me to dress like\n    your high class girlfriend.\n    You're wasting your money though.\n    All I'm gonna do is hang around\n    the hotel.  As a matter of fact,\n    I may never get out of that\n    bathtub.\n\n  Edward opens the door, he starts to exit.  He turns back.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Think again.  I'm taking you out\n    to an important dinner with me\n    tonight.\n\n  The door closes in her face.\n\n  INT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY\n\n          VIVIAN (O.S.)\n      (from inside)\n    What?  Are you crazy?\n\n  Edward smiles to himself.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Probably.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath.  The TV is on.\n  She clicks the remote control in her hand.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Three thousand...\n\n  She lies back into the soapy water and disappears.  She suddenly\n  pops back up, laughing.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Three thousand!\n\n  A thought occurs to her.  She reaches for the cordless phone.\n  She dials.  She waits.  She is about to disconnect when the\n  phone is answered.\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    'Lo.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Kit!  Where've you been?\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    I was asleep.  You woke me.  You\n    okay?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Kit, listen, the guy last night,\n    the one in the Ferrari, I'm at\n    this hotel, the Regent Beverly\n    Wilshire, it's this absolutely\n    unbelievable place and he's hired\n    me for a whole week and Kit,\n    listen, he's paying me three\n    thousand bucks!  We can get out\n    of the apartment.  We can get out\n    of this town.  We can do anything!\n      (silence)\n    Kit?  Hey, you there?\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    Why'd he want you?\n\n  That hurts.  Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same\n  thing.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    He... he just does.\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been\n    on my back.\n      (a beat)\n    Did you get the money up front\n    like I taught ya'?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Three hundred for last night and\n    he gave me extra to buy some\n    clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna\n    leave an envelope for you at the\n    front desk.\n    Give me two hundred to the scum\n    bucket and the other hundred to\n    that asshole landlord for part\n    of the rent.  Spend it on drugs\n    and I'll pull your hair out.\n\n          KIT\n    I'm getting dressed now.  I'll\n    be over.  Bye.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hey Kit, where do I go for the\n    clothes?  Good stuff on him.\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n      (brightening)\n    In Beverly Hills?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah.\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    Baby!  Rodeo Drive.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby.  She\n  is back in her hooker clothes.  She leaves an envelope at the\n  front desk.\n\n  MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from\n  his office.  He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees\n  Vivian exit out the front door.  Vivian doesn't notice the odd\n  stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are\n  just entering.\n\n  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n\n  Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than\n  a bit overwhelmed.  She passes store windows... and MORE STORE\n  WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS.  Each display is more\n  beautiful and expensive than the one before.\n\n  Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks.  From\n  PASSERBY'S.  Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at\n  her, turn away and giggle.  The uniformed GUARDS that stand at\n  attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her\n  suspiciously.\n\n  Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh\n  woman's boutique.  She hesitates for a moment.  She enters.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY\n\n  Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the\n  disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n      (cooly)\n    May I help you?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm just looking, thanks.\n\n  Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with\n  delicate glass objects.  She cautiously examines a dress.  The\n  Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    Are you looking for something in\n    particular?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yes.  Something... conservative.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    Yes...\n\n  Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone.  She examines\n  a dress.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You have beautiful things.\n      (no reply)\n    How much is this?\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    I don't think it would fit you.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (beginning to get the\n       drift)\n    I didn't ask if it would fit.\n    I asked how much it was.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    It's very expensive.\n\n  Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What is with you?\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n      (unblinking)\n    Excuse me?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm going to spend money.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    I don't think we have anything\n    for you here.  You're obviously\n    in the wrong place.\n\n  Vivian is speechless.  She turns and stomps toward the door.\n  She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman.  Vivian\n  flips her off.  She throws the door open and storms outside.\n  The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns\n  to her place.\n\n  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n\n  Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost.  She takes\n  a deep breath, trying to control herself.  Two WOMEN, in elegant\n  designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a\n  freak.  Vivian suddenly feels naked.  She turns and hurries\n  away.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid.  She feels\n  an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury\n  around her.  She hurries toward the elevators.\n\n  At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her.  He crosses\n  the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    May I help you Miss?\n\n  Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm just going to my room.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    You're a guest here?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm -- I'm with a friend.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    And who is that?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I... Edward...\n\n  Vivian's face is filled with confusion.  She doesn't know his\n  name.  The elevator doors open behind them.  She spots the\n  Operator.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (blurting it out)\n    He knows me.\n\n  Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.  The Operator\n  looks back at them innocently.  With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas\n  waves the Operator over.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Do you know this young lady?\n\n  The Operator nods.\n\n          OPERATOR\n    She's with Mr. Harris.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n      (surprised)\n    Mr. Harris?\n\n          OPERATOR\n    She apparently joined him last\n    night.\n\n  Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Why don't you come with me.  We'll\n    chat for just a moment.\n\n  He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.\n\n  INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY\n\n  In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a\n  comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    What's your name?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Vivian.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Miss Vivian... things that go\n    on in other hotels don't happen\n    at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.\n\n  Vivian says nothing.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    Mr. Harris, however, is a very\n    special customer.  And we like\n    to think of our special customers\n    as friends.  As a customer, we\n    would expect Mr. Harris to sign\n    in any additional guests.  But\n    as a friend, we're willing to\n    overlook it, I'm assuming you're\n    a... relative?\n\n  Vivian finds herself nodding.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    I thought so.  You must be his...?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Niece?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Of course.  Naturally when Mr.\n    Harris leaves, I won't see you\n    in this hotel again.\n\n  Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    Good.  We understand one another.\n      (as a gentle\n       afterthought:)\n    I would also encourage you to\n    dress in a more appropriate\n    manner.\n\n  Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    That's what I was trying to do.\n\n  She can't help it, the tears come.  Vivian pulls out the money\n  Edward gave her.  She drops it on the desk.  It's a moist-\n  looking wad now.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    I was trying to get some other\n    clothes... but...\n    they wouldn't... they made me feel\n    like shit...\n\n  She can't go on.  Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money.\n  He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her.  He sighs.\n  He picks up the phone.  He dials.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n      (into the phone)\n    Women's clothing.\n      (beat)\n    Bridget, please.\n\n  Vivian is staring at him.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    Bridget, hello, this is Barnard\n    Thomas over at the Regent Beverly\n    Wilshire.  Well, thank you, that's\n    flattering.  I'd like to ask a\n    favor of you.  I'm going to send\n    someone over.  Her name is Vivian.\n    She's a guest of ours.  A very\n    special guest.\n\n  He glances at Vivian.  With those simple words, he'd made her\n  feel better.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    She's from out of town and she\n    needs a little help in dressing.\n    Perhaps you could help her out.\n    Thank you very much.  She'll be\n    right over.\n\n  He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    There you are.  If you have any\n    other problems, come ask for me\n    personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Barney.\n\n  She smiles mischievously.\n\n  EXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY\n\n  A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port.\n\n  EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY\n\n  Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's\n  edge.  They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes\n  it.\n\n          VANCE\n    Okay... this is the jewel in\n    Kross's crown.  We can strip out\n    all the heavy equipment.  Some\n    of the cranes are very valuable\n    overseas.  The Japanese are\n    salivating for them.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Prime industrial property\n    straddling the Port of Long Beach\n    and Los Angeles.  It gives me a\n    hard-on.\n\n  Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What's that long building over\n    there?\n\n          JAKE\n    Storage, I think.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Not with those smokestacks it's\n    not.\n\n          VANCE\n    Let me check.\n\n  Vance pulls out a notebook.\n\n          JAKE\n    The real estate possibilities\n    are endless.  Most of the yard\n    we'll just level.  I talked to\n    a couple of developers, under the\n    table, of course, and they said\n    --\n\n          EDWARD\n    You what?\n\n          JAKE\n    I talked to some developers about\n    the land.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    What kind of an idiot are you?\n    You don't talk about this to\n    anyone.\n\n          JAKE\n    They're close friends, they'd\n    never breathe a word --\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (to Vance)\n    Where did you dig this moron up?\n\n          VANCE\n    He's right, Jake, that was an\n    incredibly stupid thing to do.\n    It won't happen again, Edward.\n    I'll pull him off the project\n    immediately.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Don't bother.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    What!?\n\n          EDWARD\n    We don't have the time to bring\n    someone new up to speed.\n    Besides...\n      (not unkindly, to Jake)\n    You've already impressed everyone\n    you need to, haven't you?\n\n          JAKE\n    It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.\n\n  Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.\n\n          VANCE\n    This is interesting.  That\n    building is storage now, but it\n    used to be a smelting plant.  They\n    closed it down after World War\n    II.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I want our lawyers to check into\n    the toxic waste licences on them\n    right away.  I want to know if the\n    permits are still valid and what\n    kind of limits are on them.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but\n    if the permits are still in\n    effect, they're worth a fortune.\n\n  He turns away.  The other follow Edward back toward the\n  stairs.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What time's diner tonight?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing\n    his son.  Very bright kid, watch\n    yourself with him.  Who's this\n    girl you're taking?\n\n          EDWARD\n    No one you know.\n\n  INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY\n\n  The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room\n  nervously.  She walks toward the women's clothing section.\n  BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly\n  approaches.\n\n          BRIDGET\n    You must be Vivian.\n\n  Vivian nods.\n\n          BRIDGET (cont'd)\n    Let's look at you...\n\n  She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye.\n\n          BRIDGET (cont'd)\n    Where are you from, dear?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (pause)\n    Georgia.\n\n          BRIDGET\n    No wonder.  For starts, you should\n    know that hot pants are horrid,\n    even when you do have the legs\n    to carry them off.  What are your\n    plans while you're in town?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Well... I might be going out to\n    dinner.\n\n          BRIDGET\n    You'll want a cocktail dress\n    then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful\n    figure.  A little too out in the\n    open but simply lovely.  Size six?\n    Do you need shoes?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather\n    boots go with a cocktail dress?\n\n          BRIDGET\n      (calling out)\n    Philip!  We'll need shoes!\n\n  Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes.  She pulls\n  out a dress.\n\n          BRIDGET\n    Your uncle will like this.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    He's not really my uncle.\n\n          BRIDGET\n    They never are, dear.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Mr. Thomas is behind the desk.  He looks up.  Vivian is standing\n  there, a happy look on her face.  She holds up a garment bag.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I got a dress.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n      (dryly)\n    I rather hoped you'd be wearing\n    it.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I didn't want to get it messed.\n    I got shoes too.  Wanna see?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    That's all right.  I'm sure\n    they're quite lovely.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    They were real nice to me there.\n    They treated me, y'know... nice.\n    Thanks, Barney.\n\n  Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.\n\n  She smiles at him.  He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward\n  the elevator.  The provocative way her hips move just naturally\n  attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY.  And the white gloved\n  ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for\n  Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile.  Mr. Thomas sighs.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  The phone is ringing Vivian enters.  She hurries to pick it up.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hello?\n\n  The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line.  Vivian\n  frantically punches buttons.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Hello?  What?  Hello?\n\n  INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT\n\n  Edward is in a private office.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Never answer the phone.  Ever.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Tsk, believe me, this will be the\n    last time.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Did you buy some clothes?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I got a dress, yeah.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Just one?  Christ... I hope it's\n    appropriate.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It's very tasteful.  I think\n    you'll especially like the zipper\n    in the crotch.\n      (silence)\n    I'm -- joking.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Let's hope so.  You'll get some\n    more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be\n    pushed for time so meet me in the\n    hotel lobby at seven forty-five\n    sharp.  Got it?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    No, I don't \"got it\".  Even the\n    farmboys back in Georgia come to\n    the door when they're taking you\n    on a date.\n\n          EDWARD\n    This isn't a date.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Go by yourself then.  Where you\n    taking me anyway?\n\n          EDWARD\n    The Rex.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Any good?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I think you'll approve.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    ... all right.  I'll meet you in\n    the lobby.  But only cause you're\n    paying me to.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Thank you very much.\n\n  Vivian slowly sets the phone down.  The phone rings again.\n  Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks\n  it up.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hello?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I thought I told you not to answer\n    the phone.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Oooh!\n\n  Edward hangs up.  He smiles to himself.\n\n  Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.  The doorbell\n  RINGS.  Vivian looks up, startled.  She rises, moves to answer\n  it.\n\n  It's the Spanish MAID.  She nods politely at Vivian.\n\n          MAID\n    Housekeeping.  I come to turn\n    down the bed.  5:00, I turn down\n    the bed.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What?\n\n  The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain.\n\n          MAID\n    Housekeeping.  I come to turn\n    down the bed.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Okay.\n\n  The Maid enters.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Is there a trick to it?\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  The Maid turns down the bedspread.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Is that all?  You just fold back\n    the bedspread?\n\n          MAID\n    I also place las chocolates on\n    the pillow.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Oooh, I love those.\n\n          MAID\n    I leave extras, miss.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich\n    people so lazy they can't do this\n    on their own?\n\n  Consuelo shrugs.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Mr. Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice\n  startles him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Barney.\n\n  He looks up.  He sighs.  Vivian still hasn't changed.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    What is it, Miss Vivian?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Edward is taking me to some fancy\n    place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever\n    been there?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    It's a bit beyond my... range,\n    shall we say.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, mine too.  Is it like,\n    y'know, normal?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    I think you'll find it normal\n    enough.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Will I like it?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    You'll like it fine.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're\n    the best.\n\n  She turns away.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Just mind which fork you use.\n\n  Vivian turns abruptly back, a horrified look on her face.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Fork?\n\n  INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  CLOSE ANGLE - PLACESETTING\n\n  An elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of\n  different size forks, spoons, stacked china plates and crystal\n  glassware.\n\n  ANGLE ON MR. THOMAS AND VIVIAN\n\n  sit across from one another at a fully set table.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    In fifteen minutes I can teach\n    you everything you need to know\n    to dine with the Queen.  First,\n    as you pick up the knife you shift\n    your fork to the left hand.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    But I always eat like this.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Either you're European or badly\n    brought up.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hmmm... I vonder vich.\n      (giggles)\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Actually, some of the richest\n    people I know have the worst\n    manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris,\n    being of old money, knows his way\n    around a table.  All right now,\n    pay attention please.  Salad fork.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What if they serve soup?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    They will serve salad.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    But what if they serve soup?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Then you use your soup spoon.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (smiles)\n    I like steak.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n      (picking up the\n       appropriate utensil)\n    Then you would use your--\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Steak spoon!\n      (laughs)\n\n  Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation.\n\n  WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty\n  banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner\n  service.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Miss Vivian --\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Maybe I'll just order a burger,\n    Barney, that way I can eat with\n    my hands.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Miss Vivian... there's a salon\n    here in the hotel.  Instead of\n    worrying unnecessarily about table\n    manners, why don't you just have\n    your hair done instead?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Professionally?\n\n  INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Vivian sits in a salon chair.  The last customer, THANE, a\n  young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a\n  pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her\n  professionally.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I have a friend who has a friend\n    who does Cher's wigs.\n\n          THANE\n    I hate him already.\n      (a beat)\n    All set?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah... what a ya say we chop\n    it all off and bleach the tips.\n\n          THANE\n    Darling?  Trust me.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING\n\n  Edward enters and looks around the lobby.  No Vivian.  Annoyed.\n  Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up.  He's about\n  to dial when:\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Good evening, Mr. Harris.\n\n  Edward looks at him blankly.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Barnard Thomas, manager of the\n    hotel.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse\n    me just a moment --\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    I have a message for you from your\n    \"niece\", sir.\n\n          EDWARD\n    My what?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    The young lady staying in your\n    room?\n\n  Edward's eyes narrow.  He hangs up the phone.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I think we both know she's not\n    my niece.\n\n  Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    Does this hotel have any problem\n    with that?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is\n    a guest of ours and shall be\n    treated accordingly.  The young\n    lady asked me to tell you that\n    she is waiting for you in the\n    lounge.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Thank you.\n\n  He starts towards the lounge.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Very intriguing young woman, Miss\n    Vivian.\n\n  His tone stops Edward in his tracks.\n\n          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)\n    Have a good evening, sir.\n\n  And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell\n  transpired during the afternoon.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT\n\n  Edward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian.\n  And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the\n  beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress\n  at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian\n  rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You're late.\n\n  Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without\n  thinking:\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm sorry.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You're forgiven.\n\n  She waits expectantly.  He holds out an arm.  She takes it.\n\n  INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian comes out of the ladies room.  She walks forward past\n  the MAITRE'D'S station.  She stops.  She takes a breath... and\n  then walks forward.\n\n  INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN\n\n  Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant\n  restaurant toward a far table.  Her beauty and natural grace\n  draw approving stares.  She is like a queen moving through a\n  ballroom.\n\n  At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.\n  JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire\n  industrialist.  Sitting next to him is his son and second in\n  command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.\n  All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table.  David Kross\n  holds out Vivian's chair for her.  Surprised, she nods her\n  thanks.  In front of her is an enormous placesetting.  She\n  smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.\n\n  Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of\n  them.  Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork.  But then she\n  sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and\n  is digging into his salad with that.\n\n  Vivian looks to see what Edward will do.  He doesn't seem\n  interested in eating yet.  Neither does David Kross.  Feeling\n  a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.\n\n          KROSS\n    So young man, I understand you\n    are trying to take over my\n    company.\n\n  A moment.  The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for\n  a moment.  But then he almost smiles.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Please don't patronize me, Mr.\n    Kross.  Our ages mean nothing\n    here.\n\n  Kross and David look at each other.\n\n          DAVID\n    Mr. Harris, we know you've\n    purchased at least twenty percent\n    of our stock.  We also know you\n    plan to file a formal bid for a\n    majority share.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Twenty-five percent.\n\n          KROSS\n    Mr. Harris, I built Kross\n    Enterprises myself.  I know every\n    man who ever worked there by his\n    first name.  I know their wives...\n    and their children.  If your\n    intention is to take over my\n    company and turn it into a\n    glorified real estate deal, think\n    again.\n\n  Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins\n  to eat.  Relieved, Vivian picks up hers.  They all eat for a\n  moment.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?\n\n  WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put\n  down the next course.  Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,\n  quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad.  She is\n  reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.\n\n          KROSS\n    What would it take to buy our\n    stock back?  Name your price.\n\n          EDWARD\n    To get me in a mood to sell --\n    double what I paid.  But your\n    company doesn't have enough\n    capital right now to buy anything.\n\n          DAVID\n    We're on the verge of closing\n    a large navy contract.  Double\n    is ridiculous but we can assure\n    you a healthy profit on your\n    shares.  We would give you a\n    promissory note...\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're not getting any navy\n    contracts.\n\n  Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this\n  news.\n\n          DAVID\n    There's no way you could know\n    that.\n\n          EDWARD\n    But I do know.  I also know your\n    lines of credit are over-extended.\n    If I don't buy your company,\n    someone else will...\n      (looking up)\n    Ah, the escargot.\n\n  Escargot are put down in front of everyone.  Vivian stares at\n  them dubiously.  She picks up what she assumes is the next\n  \"right\" fork.  She picks up a snail.  The two do not fit.\n  Flustered, she doesn't know what to do.  No one else seems to\n  be eating.  And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks\n  at each place.  Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (softly, to the Waiter)\n    Scume me, what are these things?\n\n          WAITER\n      (bending to whisper)\n    Escargot, mademoiselle.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (leaning close to\n       whisper)\n    Snails.\n\n  Vivian stares at them, horrified.  She, like James and David\n  Kross, no longer seem interested in eating.  Edward eats with\n  pleasure.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell\n    you my stock.  On the contrary,\n    I'm here to buy yours.\n\n          KROSS\n      (angry)\n    You've got a lot of nerve.\n\n          EDWARD\n    No.  What I have is a lot of\n    money.\n\n          KROSS\n    I know all about you, Mr. Harris.\n    When you buy companies, they have\n    a way of disappearing.  Even the\n    pension funds are stripped clean.\n    The last three companies you took\n    over were cut up in so many\n    pieces, widows were left without\n    their retirement checks.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (calmly)\n    What I did with those companies\n    was perfectly legal.\n\n          KROSS\n    I don't question the legality\n    of what you do.  It's your\n    morality that makes me sick.  I\n    will not allow my company to be\n    raped by a man like you.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (angry now)\n    It is not your company.  It's a\n    public company.  And I am going\n    to acquire it.  Either I buy from\n    the other stock holders, or I buy\n    from you.\n\n  Vivian struggles with her escargot.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    I would suggest that you and your\n    board cooperate with me, rather\n    than fight a battle you don't have\n    the ammunition to win.\n\n  Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone\n  looks to her.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Slippery little suckers...\n\n  Kross rises.\n\n          KROSS\n    If you'll excuse me young lady,\n    Mr. Harris...\n      (turns to David)\n    Deal with this, David, you know\n    where we stand.  I need to go\n    someplace and puke.\n\n  He rises.  He exits.\n\n          DAVID\n      (to Edward and Vivian)\n    Men like my father built this\n    country.  He was no saint.  He\n    screwed people.  But for every\n    guy he stepped on, he gave a\n    hundred a good job.\n\n  Edward is silent.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    He seems like a nice man.\n\n  David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.\n\n          EDWARD\n    We can reach an understanding on\n    this.\n\n          DAVID\n    I don't think so.  You should\n    know we're going to fight you with\n    every resource we have.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Do what you have to do.  I don't\n    take it personally.\n\n          DAVID\n    I do.  I take it all very\n    personally.\n      (to Vivian)\n    Very nice meeting you, Vivian.\n\n  David Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in\n  silence.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a beat)\n    And that's the way the game is\n    played.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Some game.  Screwin' some poor\n    slob out of his retirement.\n\n  Edward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Snails for dinner.  No wonder\n    everybody is in such a bad mood.\n\n  A Waiter appears at the table.\n\n          WAITER\n    Are we ready for the next course,\n    sir?\n\n          EDWARD\n    No.  Bring a check, please.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n  Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of\n  the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains\n  his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him.\n  She refills his glass from the bottle.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Thank you.\n\n  He drinks.  Silence.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You're upset, huh?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Upset.  No.  I never get upset\n    about business.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You liked the guy, though.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Whether I liked him or not is\n    irrelevant.  It's business.\n    There's no emotion involved in\n    business... if you want to\n    survive.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (excited)\n    We're the exactly the same!  Kit\n    keeps telling me don't get\n    emotional when you turn tricks\n    -- that's why no kissing -- it's\n    too personal.\n    The key is like you're saying,\n    stay numb, don't get involved --\n    when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,\n    I just do it.\n      (realizing what she's\n       saying and quickly\n       recovers)\n    Except with you.  At your price\n    I give my all...\n\n  Edward laughs.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Let's not talks about this heavy\n    stuff.  Come on, relax.\n\n  Vivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders.\n\n          EDWARD\n    That... is very good.\n\n  A moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie,\n  unbuttons his collar.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Know what we're gonna do in a\n    little while then?  We're gonna\n    call Domino's and have'm deliver\n    a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat\n    it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out\n    and watch television.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Television?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, it's this box, it has\n    pictures, sound.  You don't have\n    to use your brain at all.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I have work to do.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Uh-uh.  No work.\n\n  Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    See... what you haven't figured\n    out yet...\n\n  She kissed his neck.  She fumbles with his belt.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    Is that while you're the boss\n    everyplace else... I'm the one\n    in charge here.\n\n  She kisses his chest.\n\n          VIVIAN (cont'd)\n    You... just think you are.\n\n  She starts to kneel down.  He stops her.  They stare at one\n  another for a moment.  He releases her.  She smiles.  She\n  starts to undress him.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n  Vivian is asleep.  She turns over, slowly waking.  Her hand\n  goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed.\n  Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.  She look around\n  momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with\n  relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express\n  card on the pillow next to her.\n\n          EDWARD (O.S.)\n    Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop.\n\n  Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed.\n  He is tying his tie.  Vivian sits up and ties it for him.  He\n  smiles at her.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I still don't understand why you\n    only bought one dress.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I wasn't as much fun as I\n    thought it was going to be.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Why not?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Well, you know those cold bitches\n    that work in those stores and try\n    to intimidate you?  It works.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Was someone rude to you?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I had a little problem in one\n    store.  I wasn't dressed right.\n    I don't know what to say.  I don't\n    belong there.  Maybe I'll just\n    go back to Bridget.  She was cool.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, you belong wherever you\n    are.  I don't care how you were\n    dressed, they were the ones who\n    were wrong, not you.\n\n  Edward sits on the bed.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    People aren't going to respect\n    you unless you respect yourself.\n      (a beat)\n    The next time someone is rude to\n    you, you stare at them right here.\n\n  He softly touches her, right between the eyes.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    It's an old trick I use,\n    especially with bankers.  Works\n    every time.  Will you try it?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (confidently)\n    Okay.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Good.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (a beat)\n    Come with me?\n\n  Edward looks at his watch.  Vivian covers it with her hand.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Please.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY\n\n  A beautiful, chic women's shop.  The haughty SALESGIRL\n  approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses.  Edward hovers in the\n  b.g.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (nervous)\n    Hello.  Can you help me?\n\n  The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down.  A Pause.  Vivian gives\n  her \"the stare\" and straightens up.  We see the Salesgirl's\n  reaction change.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (confidently)\n    I'm looking for a dress, nothing\n    too flashy, not too sexy,\n    conservative.  In a size six.\n\n          SALESGIRL\n      (uncomfortable under\n       Vivian's stare)\n    Do... do you have a charge\n    account with us?\n\n  Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card.\n  The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to\n  find Vivian's size.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS\n\n  Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the\n  Salesgirl's supervision.\n\n  Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low\n  cut, spangled and fringed outfit.  Edward shakes his hand.  The\n  Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.\n  Vivian scowls.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (sighing)\n    I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n  The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor.  He turns\n  to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress.\n  Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval.  Vivian scowls.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER\n\n  Vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress.  Edward is standing\n  at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone.\n\n  INT.  STUCKEY'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT WITH EDWARD\n\n  Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to\n  Edward on the speaker phone.\n\n          VANCE\n    Kross came out of his corner\n    swinging.  He started buying up\n    all available stock as soon as\n    the market opened.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (almost to himself)\n    He's a tough old son of a\n    bitch...\n\n  Edward is watching Vivian.  She pulls the hem of her skirt up\n  to mid thigh.  She looks hopefully over to Edward.  Edward\n  shakes his head.\n\n          VANCE\n    It's up to ten and a quarter.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Offer nine and a half.  Bring\n    them back down to earth.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Goddamit!  Where is he getting\n    the money to fight?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Someone's loaning it to him.\n    Get on it right away.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Our contract guys are working\n    on the Kross pension funds.\n    There's another forty million\n    there.  We can bleed'm dry.\n\n  There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes.  He watches as\n  Vivian tries on a hat.  She preens for him.  He smiles.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (to Vance & Stuckey)\n    Put the pension funds on hold\n    until I say otherwise.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (surprised)\n    We're letting them slide?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I want the treatment plant\n    licenses to be top priority right\n    now.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    But, Edward...\n\n          EDWARD\n    Do it.\n\n  Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian.  She moves\n  to him.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (looks at his watch)\n    You're on your own now, Vivian.\n    I've got to get to work.  Be\n    sensible and you can keep\n    everything.  Spend too much and\n    it all goes back.\n\n  Vivian hugs him again.\n\n  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n\n  Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive.  She looks lovely in the pink\n  dress and new, white shoes.  A pretty, white hat is the final\n  touch.  She carries a bag containing her old clothes.  She stops\n  at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.\n\n  INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE\n\n  We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with\n  different SALESPEOPLE.  She happily and confidently tries on\n  a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.\n\n  1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall.  She tosses a dress out\n  to a waiting SALESWOMAN.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Not me!\n\n  2)  A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (imitating Bridget)\n    Horrid!\n\n  3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps.\n  Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted\n  tie.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Where'd you get your tie?\n\n  4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the\n  Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over\n  his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and\n  smiles.\n\n  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY\n\n  Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She\n  feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by,\n  smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores\n  him.\n\n  Suddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was\n  thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.\n\n  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY\n\n  Vivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's\n  courage leaves her.\n\n  The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n      (to the customer)\n    Isn't this lovely?  I think it\n    would look wonderful on you.\n\n  Vivian musters her courage.  She takes a deep breath and starts\n  forward.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n      (to her customer)\n    Would you like to try it on?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    'Scume me.\n\n  Both the saleswoman and her customer look up.  The saleswoman\n  smiles pleasantly.\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    Yes?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Do you remember me?\n\n          SALESWOMAN\n    No, I'm sorry, I don't.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I was in here yesterday.\n\n  Vivian slowly raises her middle finger.  The recognition starts\n  to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes.  Vivian's courage begins to\n  return.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah.  That's right.  It's me.\n    I want you to know something.\n    You made me feel terrible. I\n    wasn't dressed right and you said\n    I didn't belong here.  Well, I\n    do.  You're the one that was\n    wrong, not me.  And I want to tell\n    you something else.  I'm never\n    gonna shop here again as long as\n    I live.\n\n  And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.\n\n  The saleswoman is stunned.  A beat.  The customer thrusts the\n  dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's\n  speech and leaves the store also.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Mr. Thomas looks up from the desk.  And stares.  Vivian and a\n  BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel\n  lobby to the elevator.  The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes\n  and shopping bags.  Mr. Thomas can't help it.  He smiles to\n  himself.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her\n  packages.  She motions for him to place them on the couch.  He\n  does.  Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill.  He\n  exits.  The door closes.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Wheee!!!\n\n  Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch.\n\n  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY\n\n  Stuckey enters.  Edward is standing at the end of a long\n  meeting table.  He is serving himself coffee from a tray.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (gloating)\n    You were right.  Kross mortgaged\n    everything he has down to his\n    grandson's college tuition to\n    secure loans from a bank.  Not\n    just any bank.  One we do business\n    with.\n\n  Edward just sips his coffee.\n\n          STUCKEY (cont'd)\n    It goes without saying that your\n    business means a great deal more\n    to them than our friend Kross's.\n      (a beat)\n    All you have to do is make a call.\n\n  Edward is silent.  Stuckey is again surprised.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Excuse me for saying this but what\n    is wrong with you this week?\n    First, you go soft on the pension\n    funds.  Now, you're giving him\n    the chance to get away?  As of\n    two minutes ago, you are committed\n    to the tune of over fifty million\n    dollars --\n\n          EDWARD\n    Come on, Bill, don't talk to me\n    about how much money's involved.\n    It's my money.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    And some of it's mine.  Edward,\n    his jugular's exposed.\n\n  Edward hesitates.  Then:\n\n          EDWARD\n    Get the bank on the phone for me.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING\n\n  Edward enters.  He closes the door.  He turns.  And stops.  A\n  beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the\n  middle of the room.  Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.\n  A fire burns in the fireplace.  Music is playing.\n\n          VIVIAN (O.S.)\n    Hi.\n\n  Edward turns.  And stares again.  Vivian stands in the bedroom\n  doorway.  She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown.  She\n  looks incredibly beautiful.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I thought maybe you'd like dinner.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Thank you.  I would.\n      (he fingers her dressing\n       gown)\n    Nice.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Wait till you see what I have\n    on underneath.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Please.\n\n  She opens the dressing gown.  What she has on underneath is\n  absolutely nothing.  Edward crosses to her.  Taking her in his\n  arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What about dinner?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Dinner can wait.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n  The bathroom is lit by candles.  Vivian and Edward are in the\n  marble tub.  Vivian sits behind Edward.  She lazily washes his\n  shoulders and back with a large sponge.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You always been rich?\n\n          EDWARD\n    No.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Seems like it.  I guess it's easy\n    to get used to, huh?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Easier than learning how to be\n    poor.\n      (a moment; and then:)\n    My father's family was wealthy.\n    When I was young there were cars\n    and houses, private schools,\n    nannies.  But then my father\n    divorced my mother to marry\n    another woman.  And he took his\n    money with him.\n\n  Silence.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Not much to tell.  I went to\n    public school.  Went to\n    university on scholarship.  Went\n    to work for an investment firm.\n    In eight years I owned it.\n      (and then; growing very\n       quiet)\n    My father was chairman of the\n    board of the third company I ever\n    went after.  I swallowed that\n    company and shit out the pieces.\n    One of the pieces was him.\n\n  Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with\n  a finger.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You still mad at'm?\n\n          EDWARD\n    He died a long time ago.\n\n  She gently rests her head on his back.\n\n  EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n  PANNING BELLIES  People are sunbathing by the pool.\n  Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy\n  white... and then gorgeous.  The gorgeous is Vivian.  She is\n  wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses.\n\n          WAITER (O.S.)\n    Miss Vivian?\n\n  She looks up.  A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at\n  the sight of her, is holding a telephone.\n\n          WAITER\n    You have a call.  Mr. Harris.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (taking the phone)\n    Hi, baby.\n      (a moment)\n    I'll be ready.  Bye.\n\n  She hangs up.  She looks at the Waiter, confused.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What do you wear to polo?\n\n  EXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field.  An\n  enthusiastic crowd cheers.\n\n  DOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD\n\n  a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in\n  progress.  Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very\n  well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs,\n  socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.  They\n  are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo\n  match.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON\n\n  Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party.  Edward is\n  wearing his new tie.  Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful\n  in one of her new outfits.  Not that it's helping -- the place,\n  the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her\n  overwhelmed.  She suddenly stops.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You're really pushing it,\n    bringing me here.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I think it's exciting.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What id we run into someone I\n    know?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I really doubt anyone here\n    frequents Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You did.\n\n  A VOICE calls out.\n\n          STUCKEY (O.S.)\n    Edward!\n\n  They turn.  William Stuckey is with a group of people.  He waves\n  them over.\n\n          STUCKEY (cont'd)\n    Come on!  Over here!\n\n  Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (looking at Vivian)\n    Well, well, well...\n\n  Vivian dislikes this guy on sight.  Dislikes the frosty looking\n  woman at his side.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (holding out a hand;\n       smiling)\n    Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife,\n    Elizabeth.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hi.\n\n  Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Lots of fun people here.  Let me\n    get you two some champagne.\n\n  He moves quickly away.\n\n          ELIZABETH STUCKEY\n    Excuse me.\n\n  She moves to greet someone else.  Vivian and Edward survey the\n  milling CROWD.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (sarcastic)\n    Real genuine guy.\n\n          EDWARD\n    He's good at what he does.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You could freeze ice on his wife's\n    ass.  She anything like your ex?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a small smile)\n    Shall we mingle?\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  A goal is scored.\n\n  IN A SERIES OF CUTS\n\n  Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets\n  and chats and wins over different PEOPLE.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  A group of PEOPLE.\n\n          WOMAN\n    I simply love your dress, Vivian.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    This old thing?\n\n          WOMAN\n    Of course, a figure like yours\n    can wear anything.  You must work\n    out constantly.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I lead a very physical life.\n\n          OLDER MAN\n    Are you into running, Vivian?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm into walking.  I walk a lot.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  In another group of PEOPLE.\n\n          ANOTHER MAN\n    You look awfully familiar, Vivian.\n    Haven't we run into one another\n    at the spa in La Costa?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Well, I do often spa there.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with\n  a group of WOMEN.\n\n          ELIZABETH STUCKEY\n    Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm\n    and witty and down to earth.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (with pleasure)\n    She is, isn't she.\n\n          ELIZABETH STUCKEY\n    So unlike your usuals.  Where on\n    earth did you find her?\n\n  Edward smiles enigmatically.  Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a\n  passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          A WOMAN\n    We're good together.  He has to\n    admit it.  I've been just what\n    he wants me to be.  I say the\n    right things, I know the right\n    people, I give wonderful parties.\n    No question, no arguments, no\n    embarrassments.  It works for both\n    of us.\n\n  That makes Vivian think.  And then she smiles as she sees Edward\n  approaching.  Vivian moves to him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Edward, these women here, I don't\n    think any of'm like the guys\n    they're with.  They're just into\n    it for the money.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm sure that's true for some of\n    them.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I thought I was the pro.  These\n    women make me feel like an\n    amateur.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a beat)\n    Ready to stomp sod?\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  IN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC\n\n  The CROWD engages in sod stomping.  They drink champagne.  They\n  make a dance out of it.  They laugh.  Shoes get stuck in the\n  mud.  It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy\n  clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.\n  In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in\n  disbelief.\n\n  Vivian is having a wonderful time.  And then, as she moves\n  towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at\n  her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.\n  David Kross smiles at Vivian.  She hesitates... and then she\n  crosses towards him.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          DAVID KROSS\n    Hi.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hi.  I never thought stomping\n    in grass could be so much fun.\n\n          DAVID\n      (laughs)\n    I like your hat.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?\n      (pleased; a moment)\n    Uhm... how're... business things\n    going.\n\n          DAVID\n    Let's not talk about it, it's too\n    depressing.  Come on, I'll show\n    you Thunder.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Please, we hardly know each other.\n\n          DAVID\n    Thunder's a horse.  Come on.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  They approach the sweating mount.  David Kross caresses the\n  horses muzzle.\n\n          DAVID\n    Hey, big guy, you getting tired,\n    yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.\n      (a beat; and then:)\n    You two been together long?  You\n    and Edward?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    No.\n\n          DAVID\n    Hope to be?\n\n  To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It's... it's not like that.\n\n          DAVID\n    I see.  Well.  Maybe that means\n    you'd have lunch with me sometime\n    then.\n\n  Vivian is suddenly silent.  She looks away.\n\n          DAVID (cont'd)\n    I'm sorry, am I being too forward?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You don't know anything about me.\n\n          DAVID\n    I'd like to find out.  You don't\n    know anything about me either.\n    That's why people have lunch.\n\n  But something holds Vivian back, a feeling.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  William Stuckey turns... stops... stares.  He sees Vivian and\n  David Kross standing together.  He stares, his mind racing, and\n  anxious, angry look on his face.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Stuckey has Edward off to the side.  He is talking to him in\n  a low, earnest voice.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Fill me in on this.  How'd you\n    and Vivian meet?\n\n          EDWARD\n    We just did.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (grinning)\n    Come on, you can tell me.  I sure\n    would like to know where a guy\n    runs into a girl as attractive\n    as this.\n\n          EDWARD\n    The night I left your house, I\n    was lost.  I was looking for\n    directions.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    And you just happened to run into\n    her.  Great.  What's she do?  She\n    work?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes...\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Doing what?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian's in sales.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Sales, really?  That's great.\n    What does she sell?\n\n  Edward's eyes narrow.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Why do you want to know?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Hear me out.  I've known you a\n    long time.  I see a difference\n    in you this week.  Like that tie.\n    I'm suddenly wondering if this\n    girl's not the difference.\n    Especially when I see her talking\n    with David Kross.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN\n\n  Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of\n  champagne.  She scans the crowd for Edward.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY\n\n          EDWARD\n    She met him at dinner last\n    night... I like this tie.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    So now they're best friends?\n    Edward, this girl appears out of\n    nowhere and now I see her talking\n    to a guy whose company we're\n    trying to buy.  It's too\n    convenient.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're being ridiculous.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Industrial espionage is not\n    ridiculous.  Edward, how do you\n    know she hasn't attached herself\n    to you so she can bring Kross back\n    information?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,\n    she's a hooker.  I picked her up\n    off Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN\n\n  as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.  She turns.  She sees that\n  it's Stuckey laughing.  Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with\n  two glasses of champagne.\n\n  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD\n\n          STUCKEY\n    I swear to God, you are the only\n    millionaire I ever heard of who'd\n    go looking for a goddam bargain\n    streetwalker!\n\n  Edward sees Vivian coming.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Let's drop it, shall we?\n\n  Edward turns.  He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches\n  and hands him his glass of champagne.\n\n  A group of BUSINESSMEN are standing a short distance away.\n  One of them calls out:\n\n          MAN\n    Edward!  May we have your opinion\n    on something?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (to Vivian and Stuckey)\n    Excuse me a moment.\n\n  He moves to join the group of men.  Stuckey gives Vivian a\n  broad smile.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Having a good time, Vivian?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah.  Thanks.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    All this must be quite a change\n    from Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n  Vivian looks as if she's been struck.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your\n    secret's safe with me.\n\n  Stuckey runs his hand up her arm.\n\n          STUCKEY (cont'd)\n    What do you charge, Vivian?\n    Maybe you and I could get together\n    after Edward leaves.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (forcing a bitter smile)\n    Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me\n    at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    I just might do that.\n\n  He moves away.  Vivian turns.  Edward looks up from his\n  conversation, sees her looking at him.  He smiles, raises his\n  glass in a small toast.  A moment.  Vivian toasts him back.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n  They enter.  Edward switches on a light.  Vivian comes down the\n  steps into the room.  Edward follows after her.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're awfully quiet.  You haven't\n    said a word since the party.\n\n  As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and\n  explodes with anger.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You asshole!  I can't believe what\n    a --!\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, what the --\n\n  Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Clean the slut up, take her out,\n    huh?!  What are you trying to\n    prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat\n    for you to offer to your friends!\n\n          EDWARD\n    I don't know what you're talking\n    about.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I've been with stinking old men\n    who've made me want to puke but\n    I've never had anyone make me feel\n    as dirty as you did tonight.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Would you please calm down.  Tell\n    me what happened.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Stuckey!  He wants an\n    \"appointment\" with me after you\n    leave.  You my pimp now or did\n    he think that up on his own?\n\n  Edward looks guiltily away.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What was I supposed to do?\n      (a beat)\n    I told the truth.  Why should the\n    truth upset you?  It's not as if\n    you're from a convent.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I want my fucking money.  I'm\n    getting out of here.  I don't want\n    anything more to do with you.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Can we talk about this?  Can you\n    just try to calm down?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Your goddamned friend, he thinks\n    the only reason I'm with you is\n    for the money.\n\n  A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (defiantly)\n    Well, it's true.  Just pay me\n    what you owe me and I'm gone.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Pay me!  Before I pick up this\n    chair and smash your face in.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Fine.  I'm only here a couple\n    of more days and I'm not going\n    to spend them fighting with you.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Fuck off.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll call you a cab.  If you want\n    the clothes, pack them up.\n\n  Vivian stands quietly for a moment.  And then she turns and\n  walks into the bedroom.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n  Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light\n  of the bedroom.  As she does she starts crying.  With each item\n  of clothing the tears come down harder.  Edward appears at the\n  doorway.  His face is genuinely concerned.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't\n    prepared for questions about us.\n    It was an idiotic and insensitive\n    thing I did.  I should have known\n    that it would hurt you.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt\n    you when somebody pisses on you,\n    it just pissed you off.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I really am sorry.\n\n  Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms.  Sobbing, she stands\n  limply.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You hurt me.\n\n  Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders.\n  She touches his hand.  He sits on the bed.  He pulls her to him\n  and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll make it up to you.\n\n  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY\n\n  Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long\n  hallway.  Stuckey trails after him.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    This is no time to disappear.\n    We're in too far.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross\n    isn't going anywhere and I don't\n    need to spend the rest of the day\n    watching his stock go down.  I'll\n    be in the office tomorrow.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Promise me you'll read those\n    contracts by then.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Goodbye, Bill.\n\n  Stuckey stops.  He calls after Edward.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!\n\n  Edward hurries on.\n\n  EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY\n\n  Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators.  Mr. Thomas\n  at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Afternoon.\n\n  Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display\n  in the hotel jewelry store window.  He detours from the\n  elevators and moves to the window for a closer look.  He thinks\n  a moment and enters the jewelry store.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON\n\n  Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing\n  an elegant red sequined evening dress.  She looks incredibly\n  beautiful.  She sees the phone.  A thought occurs to her and\n  going to it, she picks it up.  Waits.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    C'mon, Kit...\n\n  No answer.  She hears someone at the door.  She hangs up.\n  Edward enters.  He is carrying a small case.  He stops at the\n  sight of Vivian.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Do I look okay?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a small smile)\n    Hmm... let's see... no, there's\n    something missing.\n\n  He holds up the small case.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What's that?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I don't want you to get too\n    excited... these are on loan...\n    however...\n\n  Vivian's jaw drops.  Edward is holding a diamond and ruby\n  necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he\n  breathed too hard.  Edward behind Vivian, fastens the\n  necklace around her neck.\n\n          EDWARD\n    This is made for a princess.\n    I think she'd approve of you\n    wearing it tonight.  There.\n    Come look.\n\n  He leads her to a mirror.  She stares at her reflection.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Edward, I can't.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Shush.  Of course you can.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What if I lose it?\n\n          EDWARD\n    You won't.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What if someone tries to steal\n    it?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll guard them and you with my\n    life.\n\n  EDT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY\n\n  A limo pulls onto the tarmac at Burbank Airport.  A PILOT in\n  a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo\n  door.  Edward -- now wearing evening clothes -- and Vivian climbs\n  out of the limo.\n\n          PILOT\n    Your plane is ready to go, Mr.\n    Harris.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Very good.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Plane?\n\n  Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You don't want to go all the way\n    to San Francisco in a limousine,\n    do you?  I don't.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Where are you taking me!?\n\n          EDWARD\n    To meet some friends.  Rudolpho,\n    a poet... Benoit, a landlord...\n    Mimi, a flower maker...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Huh?\n\n          EDWARD\n    The opera.\n\n  Up ahead is a waiting private jet, its engines already HUMMING.\n  She is speechless.  Edward grins, loving the look on her face.\n\n  EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY\n\n  The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.\n\n  INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY\n\n  Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.\n  Vivian can't believe the cabin.  It is a comfortable room\n  featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in\n  bar, television and stereo.  Edward is once again, going over\n  papers.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I've never been on a plane\n    before.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm glad you like it.  Now be\n    quiet, I've really got to read\n    these.\n\n  Vivian fluffs her hair up.  She makes a happy, excited growling\n  sound -- Rrrrr!  A wicked gleam comes to her eye.\n\n  She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him.  He looks\n  up.  She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken\n  quarters.  She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, what do you think you're\n    doing?\n\n  Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Being quiet.\n\n  She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face.  Edward sets\n  down his papers.\n\n  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET\n\n  The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the\n  coast.\n\n          VIVIAN (O.S.)\n    You ever been in love with\n    anyone?\n\n  INT. CORPORATE JET - SUNSET\n\n  Vivian is at the window, looking out.  She carefully puts her\n  earrings back on.  She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the\n  golden gate bridge in the distance.  She turns.  Edward is\n  buttoning his shirt.  He is silent.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Sorry.  You're not paying me to\n    ask you question like that.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian.  I'm paying you to be\n    you.  Be you.\n      (a beat)\n    Have you?  Ever been in love with\n    anyone?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You mean, besides Elvis?\n      (turning back to the\n       window)\n    I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once.\n    First time I ever ran away from\n    home, I got as far as Atlanta.\n    I met this boy.  He'd been with\n    his parents on their way to\n    Chicago.  They stopped at a gas\n    station.  He went to the john.\n    When he came back they'd split.\n    We sorta started looking out for\n    each other.  Aw, he was sweet.\n    And boy, was he good looking,\n    y'know, dark hair and eyes.\n    The chicken hawks were on him all\n    the time.  He hated that.\n    Sometimes we'd find a safe place\n    to crash nights and we'd curl up\n    together and we'd talk about all\n    these crazy things.  The two of\n    us getting married someday.\n    Having kids.  Stupid stuff.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What happened to him?\n\n  A moment.  Vivian shrugs.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    My father found me.  Dragged me\n    home.  I don't know why, he never\n    seemed to like me much when I was\n    there.\n      (a bitter smile)\n    'Cept when he was drunk, then he\n    liked me a whole lot.\n      (a moment)\n    I made it back to Atlanta a year\n    later.  Andy was gone.\n\n  Silence.  Vivian stares out the window.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Aw, but things sure look fine\n    when you're sitting way up high.\n\n  Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her\n  shoulders, stares with her out at the view.  Vivian rests her\n  head against him.\n\n  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n  An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco\n  Opera House.  The DRIVER walks around back and opens the\n  passenger door.  Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.\n\n  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n  Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through\n  the elegant lobby.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Some people say that opera is an\n    acquired taste, but I don't\n    believe it.  You can always tell\n    when someone goes to the opera\n    for the first time.  They either\n    love it or hate it.  Those who\n    love it will always love it; those\n    who hate it might come to\n    appreciate it, but they'll never\n    truly love it.\n\n  Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit\n  fountain with several graceful statues in its center.\n  Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and\n  prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without\n  realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace.\n  She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and\n  steal it.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Viv?  I really doubt if anyone\n    here is going to try and grab it.\n\n  Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.\n\n  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT\n\n  A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their\n  seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes\n  -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative\n  glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her\n  necklace.\n\n          EDWARD\n    They all think you look very\n    beautiful, Vivian.\n\n  Vivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand\n  from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She\n  takes it.  They start forward.\n\n  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT\n\n  Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the\n  stage.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    If it's in Italian, how will I\n    know what they're saying?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll whisper some of the main\n    parts of the story to you.  But\n    you'll be surprised how much you\n    understand.  The music conveys\n    the story more powerfully than\n    any words.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    But don't they have it in\n    English?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, don't be afraid of what\n    you don't know.  That's the fun\n    of it.\n\n  The lights dim.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (resigned)\n    Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm\n    glad you brought me.\n\n  The orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely\n  on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.\n\n  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT\n\n  IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.\n\n  The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward\n  leans over to translate the tenor's aria.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What am I?  I am a poet.  Not\n    a man of wealth but one rich in\n    dreams.  You have come to replace\n    my vanished dreams.  I dwell now\n    only in your eyes.\n\n  The MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The\n  story continues.\n\n  Edward again leans close to Vivian.\n\n          EDWARD\n    And now she asks Rudolpho if he\n    still thinks her beautiful --\n\n  Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes\n  are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help.\n\n  The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is\n  reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill\n  with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long\n  moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.\n  Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.\n\n  As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.\n\n  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT\n\n  As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined\n  mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile\n  at her.\n\n          OLDER WOMAN\n    Did you enjoy the opera, dear?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (tearfully)\n    It was so beautiful I just about\n    pissed my pants.\n\n  Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he\n  and the still misty Vivian exit.\n\n  INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER\n\n  Edward and Vivian sit side by side.\n\n          EDWARD\n    If you'd gone on about how much\n    you liked it, I'm not sure I'd\n    have believed you.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I more than liked it.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I know.  I'm glad.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Did you?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more.\n    Thank you.\n\n  Vivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward\n  she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise.\n  He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the\n  first time they've kissed and they make it very special.\n\n  EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT\n\n  The plane flies in the night.  Back to L.A.\n\n  INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n  IN A SERIES OF CROSS FADES Edward and Vivian make love.\n  Equally giving, equally taking.  No masks, no shields.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER\n\n  In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together.\n  Edward cradles Vivian.  Her back rests against his chest.  His\n  arm is over her body.\n\n  She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines\n  it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back.  She\n  gently kisses the palm.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Love you...\n\n  She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast.  She closes\n  her eyes, ready to sleep now.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT\n\n  His eyes open.  Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with\n  him with sudden confusion and uncertainty.  He stares into the\n  dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING\n\n  The phone rings.  Edward immediately reaches out and picks it\n  up.  He is dressed in a robe.  Breakfast is on the umbrella'd\n  table in front of him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes?\n\n  INT.  STUCKEY'S HOME - LIBRARY- MORNING - INTERCUT\n\n  Stuckey, not even dressed yet, paces around his desk.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Did I wake you?\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm up.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    I had to call.  I jus got off\n    the phone with James Kross.  Get\n    this.  He wants to see you.\n    Today.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Why?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    He wouldn't say.  Edward... I\n    think we got him.  His nuts are\n    on the block and we got him.\n      (silence)\n    You there?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Give me twenty minutes.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    We'll be there.  Listen, if he's\n    really caving in, we'll go from\n    there down to the office.  I want\n    him to commit his stock to us this\n    morning.\n\n  Edward hangs up.  His mind seems on other things.  He rises.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n  Vivian is still asleep.  She is face down on the bed, the\n  sheets just covering her to her waist.  Edward stares down at\n  her.  He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line\n  of her spine.  Vivian murmurs contentedly.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Mmm.\n      (opening her eyes;\n       looking at him)\n    Hi.\n\n  Edward smiles at her softly.  And then:\n\n          EDWARD\n    Better get dressed.  We're having\n    guests.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian is wearing her yellow dress.  She stares at herself in\n  the bedroom mirror.  Her hair... her make-up... she realizes\n  how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.\n\n  Edward comes out of the bathroom.  He crosses to the closet\n  for a tie.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Here.  Let me.\n\n  She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him.  He is very\n  aware of the closeness of her.  She smiles at him.  He smiles;\n  puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment.  Looking up,\n  she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes.  He releases\n  her hand.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (quietly)\n    One more night and you're finally\n    rid of me.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, you've been pretty tough\n    to take.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I have to go to New York\n    tomorrow.\n\n  Vivian says nothing.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    But I'll be back in Los Angeles.\n    Soon.  I'd like to see you again.\n    I thought we could work out\n    something... An arrangement.\n\n  Vivian is silent.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    I'll get you an apartment, buy\n    you a car --\n\n  Vivian sighs, letting something go inside.  Finished with his\n  tie, she turns away.\n\n          EDWARD (cont'd)\n    What is it?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (not unkindly)\n    What else?  You gonna leave some\n    cash by the bed when you pass\n    through town?\n\n          EDWARD\n    It wouldn't be like that.  I want\n    to get you off the street.  You'll\n    have a different kind of life.\n    What's wrong with that?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'm sorry.  That's very sweet,\n    Edward, and I know you mean it...\n\n  She is silent.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, I've thought about this\n    a lot.  This is the best solution.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (shakes her head \"no,\"\n       then continues tying\n       his tie)\n    When I was a little girl, my\n    mother locked me in the attic when\n    I was bad, which was pretty often.\n    I'd stare out the window up there\n    and make believe I was a princess\n    trapped in the tower by the wicked\n    queen.  Then suddenly a knight\n    on a white horse with his bright\n    colors flying would ride up.\n    Rescue me from the tower, and then\n    we'd ride off... but never, ever\n    in all the times I had that dream\n    did the knight say, \"Come on baby,\n    I'll put you up in a great condo.\"\n\n  She finished his tie.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (softly; to herself)\n    I know.\n      (a beat)\n    Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being\n    stupid.\n      (more)\n    I'll think about it, okay?  It's\n    a real good offer for a whore.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I've never treated you like a\n    whore.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (not mean)\n    You just did.\n\n  The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n  Edward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind\n  him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters.\n  He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask\n  his surprise.\n\n          KROSS\n    Mr. Harris.\n\n          EDWARD\n    How are you, Mr. Kross.\n\n          KROSS\n    Not bad for a man who hasn't\n    slept in four nights.  I'll get\n    used to it.\n\n  An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.\n  Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another\n  perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes\n  the door and leads them all down the stairs.\n\n  Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods\n  at Vivian.\n\n          KROSS\n    Young lady.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hello.\n      (to David)\n    Hi.\n\n          DAVID\n    Hello, Vivian.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Let's not waste time here, shall\n    we?  Mr. Kross, you said this\n    morning, you wished to speak with\n    Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now\n    listening.\n\n  Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone.  He\n  turns to Edward.\n\n          KROSS\n    Yes.  I'm here to tell you that\n    I've reconsidered my position on\n    your acquisition offer.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Expected... offer.\n\n          KROSS\n    Of course, yes.  After the\n    expected filing period is over,\n    I'm going to recommend to the\n    board that we accept your bid.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (a moment)\n    You're making the right decision,\n    sir.\n\n  Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward.  He is surprised to\n  see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.\n  Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second\n  thoughts.\n\n          KROSS\n    I'll see you on one condition.\n    I'm not so concerned for me but\n    the people who have worked for\n    me...\n\n  Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (quickly)\n    They'll be taken care of.  Won't\n    they, Edward?\n\n  Kross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly\n  nods.\n\n          KROSS\n    I'll sign anything you want then.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Today.\n\n  Kross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft.\n\n          KROSS\n    Today.\n\n  Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,\n  obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates.\n  He turns to Kross:\n\n          EDWARD\n    Excuse me, please?\n\n  He heads to the bedroom.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hello.  Is Kit DeLuca there?\n    When she comes in will you have\n    her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.\n    Yes.  Okay.\n\n  She hangs up as Edward comes in.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    What did you do to him?\n\n          EDWARD\n    What do you mean?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Last time I saw him he was this\n    strong guy.  Now he's beaten.\n    And you liked him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian, I want you to listen to\n    me.  The man realized that it\n    would be better for his future\n    and his son's future, if he\n    cooperated.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Right.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It's not your concern.  It's...\n    business, that's all.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Business.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes.  The man made a business\n    decision.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It's all just business to you.\n    Him.  Me.  Your life.\n    Everything's business.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It's what I do for a living.\n    It's how I make money.\n\n  Silence.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'll be back in a few hours.\n    We'll talk about this later.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n  Edward enters the living room.  The men look at him\n  expectantly.\n\n          EDWARD\n    We'll continue this down at the\n    office.\n\n  He heads for the door.\n\n  EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY\n\n  Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city\n  beyond.  The phone RINGS.  She turns and hurries inside.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian answers the phone.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Lo?\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - INTERCUT\n\n  Mr. Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained\n  expression on his face.\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    Barnard Thomas here.  Miss\n    Vivian, I wonder if you might come\n    down to the front desk.  There's\n    someone here to see you.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Me?\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n    I'd send them up, but sadly, I\n    don't trust the young lady to find\n    you on her own.\n\n  A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas.\n  Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and\n  all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.\n\n          KIT\n    Viv?  Where are you, babe?\n      (glaring at Mr. Thomas)\n    The sphincter-police won't let\n    me through.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY\n\n  Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda.  She\n  smacks her lips like a happy, little girl.  Vivian isn't having\n  anything.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yes, I'm glad you're clean but\n    I've been calling and calling.\n\n          KIT\n    Was that you?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Who did you think?\n\n          KIT\n    Carlos.  I still owe him two\n    hundred bucks...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Kit, I left that money for you\n    days ago.\n\n          KIT\n    Yeah.  I just got it.\n\n  An OLDER COUPLE walk past the table.  They stare at Kit.\n\n          KIT\n    Fifty bucks, grampa.  For\n    seventy-five, the wife can watch.\n\n  Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Kit...\n\n          KIT\n    Everybody keeps starin' at me.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah... I know what you mean.\n\n          KIT\n    What do you know?  You look good.\n    All dressed up.\n      (meaning it)\n    You clean up real nice.\n      (giggling)\n    You sure don't fit in down on\n    the Boulevard, lookin' like you\n    do.  Not that you ever did anyway.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You think I fit here where they\n    just about chew your food for you?\n\n          KIT\n    Where do you fit?\n\n  Vivian is silent, then.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (suddenly)\n    I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.\n\n          KIT\n    Honey, you're not supposed to\n    do that.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I know.  I stopped pretending\n    and started liking it with him\n    for real.\n\n          KIT\n    Oh, my god, you mean it was good?\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (miserably)\n    It was great.\n\n          KIT\n    Dummy.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    He wants to set me up in a place,\n    give me some money.\n\n          KIT\n    I pray for that.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (nods)\n    All I'm doing is feeling lousy\n    about it.  I don't know what to\n    do.  What do I do, Kit?\n\n          KIT\n    Go for the bucks.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I don't care about bucks.\n      (a beat)\n    I might love this guy.\n\n          KIT\n    Wow, are you in deep shit.\n      (a sigh)\n    You know he'll break your heart.\n\n  Vivian is silent again.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    I blame myself here.  First time\n    I laid eyes on ya', I knew you\n    were too complicated to be a\n    whore.\n\n  Vivian nods.  Her face is filled with confusion.\n\n  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n  Edward stands at the window looking out.  There is something\n  about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just\n  seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of\n  the story.\n\n  Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.  He begins laying\n  them out on the conference table.\n\n          JAKE\n    Congratulations, sir.\n\n          EDWARD\n    What?\n\n          JAKE\n    Mr. Kross is just getting off\n    the phone with his stock broker.\n    It's finished.  You've won.\n\n  Edward says nothing.\n\n          JAKE\n    Who are you going after next, sir?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Who indeed...\n\n  He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter\n  the room.  They surround a conference table.  Kross sits, the\n  papers laid out in front of him.  Stuckey hands Kross a pen.\n  A SECRETARY lays out finger food.  They wait for her to leave\n  before they speak.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    If we can get these letters of\n    intent out of the way now... Mr.\n    Harris and I would like to ask\n    you some questions about your\n    company.\n\n          DAVID\n    Dad, excuse me, but that's\n    inappropriate.  You're under no\n    obligation to answer any questions\n    at all.\n\n          KROSS\n    Could we at least wait till after\n    the filing period?\n\n  Stuckey glances to Edward for help.  Edward is silent; indeed\n  it's as if something is twisting inside of him.  Stuckey plunges\n  ahead.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Mr. Harris is preparing a bid\n    based on our speculation of the\n    corporation's net worth.  The\n    price he ultimately pays for your\n    father's stock will be based on\n    that bid.  The more we know, the\n    higher our bid can be.\n\n          KROSS\n    It's in my best interest to\n    cooperate, David.\n\n          DAVID\n    If he throws himself on your\n    sword, you promise to take care\n    of him and his family, huh?\n\n  David stares at him.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    That's unfair!\n\n          DAVID\n    You bed it is.\n      (to Edward)\n    You're everything he said you\n    were.\n      (to his father)\n    Do what you have to do, Dad.\n    Just don't expect me to watch it.\n\n  He exits.  A moment.  Kross looks at Edward with a resigned\n  smile.\n\n          KROSS\n    He's young.  He hasn't learned\n    how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll\n    sign your papers.  And I'll answer\n    your questions.  Whatever you\n    want.\n\n  He sighs.  He picks up the pen.  He's about to sign.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Stop.  For just a moment.\n      (a moment)\n    Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you\n    a few questions before you sign.\n    You realize that you're a target.\n    If you weren't mine, you'd be\n    someone elses, correct?\n\n          KROSS\n    Yes.\n\n          EDWARD\n    If you had a... reprieve, what\n    would do?\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (quickly)\n    I don't think there's any sense\n    in --\n\n          EDWARD\n    Let him answer.\n\n          KROSS\n    I... I would take advantage of\n    it.\n\n          EDWARD\n    How?\n\n  Kross looks uncertain.  He gropes for an answer.\n\n          KROSS\n    I... I don't know.  There...\n    there wasn't time...\n\n          EDWARD\n    I suppose you'd find out soon\n    enough that you have assets you\n    presently don't seem aware of,\n    wouldn't you?  The waste\n    processing licenses at that\n    abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd\n    certainly find out about that.\n\n  Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Oh, my god... Edward, no!\n\n          EDWARD\n    I suppose you'd use them as\n    collateral on new loans, wouldn't\n    you?\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Have you lost your mind?\n\n          KROSS\n      (to Stuckey)\n    Quiet.\n      (to Edward)\n    Would I get the loans?\n\n          EDWARD\n    This time I imagine you would,\n    yes.\n      (as if thinking about\n       it)\n    Hmm...\n      (a moment)\n    With all this in mind, Mr. Kross,\n    I can't logically make a formal\n    bid on your company, can I?\n\n          KROSS\n      (a small smile)\n    You'd be initiating a financial\n    battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr.\n    Harris.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're very right.  I think the\n    best thing we could all do is go\n    home.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    What!?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Have a good day, gentlemen.\n\n  He exits from the room.  Stuckey follows.\n\n  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY\n\n  Edward is walking down the hall.  Stuckey comes out of the\n  office and calls after him.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (calls)\n    Edward, what happened?  What kind\n    of move was that?\n\n  Edward silently goes into the elevators.  The doors close.\n\n          STUCKEY\n      (yells)\n    Dammit Edward, speak to me.\n\n  Stuckey heads back to the conference room.\n\n  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n  Edward comes out of the building.  His Chauffeur leaps to open\n  the limo door.\n\n          EDWARD\n    No... take the car back to the\n    hotel.  I need to walk.\n\n  He sets off across Century Park East.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING\n\n  Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings.\n  She turns.  It rings again.\n\n  She opens it.  Stuckey is standing outside with a small\n  briefcase.  He looks agitated.  He tries to hide it.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Well, well... Hello again.  I'm\n    looking for Edward.\n\n  Vivian just stares at him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Edward's not back.  I thought\n    he was with you.\n\n  Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    No, I'll just have to wait then,\n    won't I?\n\n  There is a bar set up.  Stuckey sets his briefcase down.  He\n  crosses to the bar.\n\n          STUCKEY (cont'd)\n    Mind if I have a drink?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    No.\n\n  He pours liquor in a glass.  He fires it down.  It seems to\n  calm him a bit.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Do you want to know what he did?\n    Do you want to know what the crazy\n    son of a bitch did?  He handed\n    the whole thing back to Kross!\n    On a silver platter.  For no\n    reason!  What was he thinking,\n    I mean, what was going through\n    his goddam head?  Why?\n      (pours another drink)\n    What was all that benevolent\n    crap?  What are we going to\n    become, a philanthropic\n    foundation?  I'll probably be the\n    director of several worthwhile\n    charities.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I think it's great.\n\n  Stuckey glares at Vivian.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    I bet.  A lousy whore and you're\n    the gum in a hundred million\n    dollar deal.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (mocking)\n    Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just\n    business.\n\n  He looks at her a moment.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    But what do I know, maybe you're\n    worth it.  Come on, show me.\n    Let's see your act.\n\n  He grabs her wrist.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Get out!\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Don't worry.  I'll pay for it.\n    What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty,\n    thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are\n    you a fifty dollar whore?\n\n  He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top\n  of him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Are you crazy?\n\n  She bites his hand.  Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing\n  back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the\n  force of another slap.  Stuckey slams her up against a wall and\n  starts rubbing up against her.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    You got a mean streak in you,\n    don't you.\n\n  He tries to kiss her again.\n\n          STUCKEY (cont'd)\n    Is that what he likes about you?\n    Huh?  Answer me!\n\n  And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder.  Stuckey turns\n  his head, startled.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V.\n\n  Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE\n\n  Stuckey falls on the ground.  Edward rushes forward, berserk\n  with rage, to hit Stuckey again.  His fist hits the top of\n  Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.\n\n  Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries\n  to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into\n  the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again\n  tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're\n  not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    You broke my nose.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I think I broke my hand.\n      (a beat)\n    You're fired.\n\n          STUCKEY\n    Edward, we've been together ten\n    years.\n\n          EDWARD\n    And I don't like what we've\n    become.  I'll cover any losses\n    you have on this one.

Edward stands there,\n  reflecting on what he's done.\n\n          EDWARD\n      (to himself, almost\n       proud)\n    Well, I didn't plan that!\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER\n\n  Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Why do guys always know how to\n    hit a woman?  Right across the\n    cheek, wham, so it feels like your\n    eye is gonna explode.  What do\n    they do, take you all aside in\n    high school and show you how?\n    It pisses me off!\n\n          EDWARD\n    Not all men hit.  And no one is\n    going to hit you anymore.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Right.\n      (softening)\n    You're quite the Sir Galahad\n    today, aren't ya'?\n      (a beat)\n    I heard what you did with Kross.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It was a business decision.\n\n  Vivian looks at him.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I got tired of hating my father.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (a small smile)\n    It was good.\n\n          EDWARD\n    It felt good.\n\n  Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases.\n\n          EDWARD\n    You're packing.\n\n          VIVIAN\n      (nods)\n    I'm leaving.\n      (a moment)\n    Don't ya see?

What\n    are you gonna do, fight'm all?\n    No.  I'll take my money now,\n    please.\n\n  A moment.  Edward reaches for his wallet.  He counts out bills.\n  He places them in Vivian's suitcase.  He puts his arms around\n  Vivian.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Aw, don't... no...\n\n          EDWARD\n    Stay with me tonight.  Not\n    because you're being paid to.\n    Stay with me because you want to.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I do.  I do want to.  That's why\n    I'm leaving.\n      (turning to him)\n    That's what you given me, see?\n    I know what I want now.  I want\n    a guy like you for real.  Not\n    because you buy me things and give\n    me money.  The nicest thing you\n    ever done for me is hold my hand.\n    You gonna give me that?\n\n  Edward is silent.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I didn't think so.\n\n          EDWARD\n    Vivian...\n\n          VIVIAN\n    It's not your fault.  You're\n    right.  Kit's right.\n      (looks him right in the\n       eye)\n    But I want the fairy tale.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING\n\n  Vivian comes out of the elevators.  A BELLMAN sees her and\n  springs forward, reaching for her bags.\n\n          BELLMAN\n    Let me take those, miss.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Thanks.\n\n  Vivian sees Mr. Thomas behind the front desk.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'll be out front in a minute.\n    I got a cab comin'.\n\n  The bellman moves away.  Vivian walks to the front desk.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Hi, Barney!\n\n          MR. THOMAS\n      (looking up)\n    Miss Vivian.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Look I just wanted to say\n    goodbye.\n\n          MR.

THOMAS\n    Certain ladies make that very\n    easy... Vivian.\n      (turning to the desk\n       clerk)\n    John, call a limousine for our\n    guest, please.  Have it take her\n    anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill\n    the hotel.\n      (turning back to Vivian)\n    See you again sometime soon.\n\n  Vivian smiles softly at him.  She turns and walks for the door.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY\n\n  A long silver limo drives down Hollywood Blvd.\n\n  INT. LIMO - DAY\n\n  The LIMO DRIVER pushes the button that rolls down the screen\n  between back and front seats.\n\n          DRIVER\n    You're sure this is the right\n    street, ma'am?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yes. 1312.  It's a big apartment\n    building.\n\n  EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n  The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment\n  building on a dirty Hollywood side street.  The Limo Driver,\n  a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to\n  the passenger door.  As he does, he surveys the surroundings\n  uncomfortably.  Ths is rough neighborhood.  He opens the door.\n  Vivian steps out.\n\n          LIMO DRIVER\n    Maybe I should go with you.  This\n    doesn't look like a good place\n    for a lady to be alone.\n\n  Several PEOPLE pass.  All of them stare at the car, at the\n  driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    I'll be okay.  I'm home.  Thank\n    you.\n\n  The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the\n  apartment building.  He drives off.\n\n  INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Vivian walks toward her apartment.  The Landlord is sitting\n  at the front desk in a dirty undershirt.\n\n          LANDLORD\n    Hey, we announce guests here.\n    You a relative of somebody?\n\n  Vivian lowers her sunglasses.\n\n          LANDLORD (cont'd)\n    Viv -- is that you?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Yeah, it's me.\n\n  She keeps walking.\n\n          LANDLORD\n    You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice\n    threads.  I gotta find time to\n    shop.\n\n  INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY\n\n  Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out.  He is\n  dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his\n  expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw\n  him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the\n  bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him.\n\n          BELLMAN\n    Is that everything, sir?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (turning from the\n       window)\n    That's everything.\n\n  The Bellman exits, closing the door behind him.  The phone\n  rings.  Edward crosses to it, picks it up.  The Maid comes in,\n  looks around.\n\n          MAID\n    The lady, she go?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes.  She go.\n\n  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n  Edward with the Bellhop heads to the front door.  He's leaving.\n\n          BELLHOP\n    Do you have a car taking you to\n    the airport, sir?\n\n          EDWARD\n    Yes.\n\n  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n  Vivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing\n  clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket.  Her\n  bureau's are open.  She is packing.  Kit is watching.  She takes\n  the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and\n  packs it.\n\n          KIT\n    So whatta' you going to do in\n    San Francisco?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Get a job and probably go back\n    to school.  Figure out what I'm\n    gonna be.\n\n          KIT\n    What kind of school?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    School, school.  Regular.

Not in a\n    million.\n\n  They laugh together.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    What time's your bus?\n\n          VIVIAN\n    Couple a hours.\n\n          KIT\n    Yeah.  Well...

For food, got it?\n    Eat something before the wind\n    blows you away.\n\n          KIT\n    I'm gonna pay you back next time\n    I see ya, babe.

FALAFEL STAND - DAY\n\n  Kit enters, sits at the counter.\n\n          KIT\n    Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a\n    grilled cheese on white, okay?\n\n  A very young GIRL is sitting just down the counter from Kit.\n  Kit nods at her.\n\n          KIT\n    Hey, how you doin'.  You new,\n    huh?\n\n          GIRL\n    Yeah.  Got a cigarette?\n\n          KIT\n    Sure.\n\n  She passes the girl down the pack.  She strikes a match, lights\n  her cigarette for her.  The girl inhales deep, lets it out with\n  a sigh.  She looks towards the window.\n\n          GIRL\n    Jeez, did the wacko in the suit.\n\n  Kit turns to look.\n\n  KIT'S P.O.V. - HOLLYWOOD BLVD.\n\n  Outside, across the street, Edward has accosted two\n  PROSTITUTES; one blonde, one a red haired black one.\n\n  INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY - BACK TO SCENE\n\n  Kit rises.\n\n          KIT\n    Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm,\n    I'll be back.\n\n  She heads out the door.\n\n  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY\n\n  Edward is still talking to the prostitutes.\n\n          EDWARD\n    I'm looking for a girl, Vivian,\n    young, dark hair, big eyes...?\n\n  They shake their heads.\n\n          EDWARD\n    She's mouthy.  Sort of\n    difficult...?\n\n          PROSTITUTE 1\n    Ain't seen her, wouldn't know\n    her.\n\n          PROSTITUTE 2\n    What's wrong with us, man?  Two\n    for the price a one, what ya say?\n\n          EDWARD\n      (disappointed)\n    Thank you.  No.\n\n  They turn and walk away.  Edward stands there, not knowing\n  what to do next.  He looks discouraged and lost.\n\n          KIT (O.S.)\n    Edward Harris, as I live and\n    breathe!\n\n  Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him.  Kit smiles,\n  triumphantly.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she\n    said.\n\n  She turns and starts away.  She stops, turns back.\n\n          KIT (cont'd)\n    You comin' or not?  I don't got\n    all day, I got a grilled cheese\n    waitin'.\n\n  Edward follows Kit.\n\n  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n  Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought.  Her bags are packed,\n  ready to go.  With a sigh she rises.  She picks up the bags,\n  exits the room.\n\n  Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking\n  it all in for the last time.  She suddenly looks more than a\n  little bit frightened to be leaving.  She musters resolve.  She\n  goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her.\n  Silence.  Vivian suddenly comes back in.  She puts down her\n  bags.  She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee\n  can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into\n  it, places it back where Kit will find it.\n\n  She turns and starts again for the door.\n\n  She stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La\n  Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses\n  it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The\n  music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her\n  imagination.  She hurries over to the window.\n\n  EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n  Vivian comes out onto the fire escape.  She stares in wonder.\n\n  A snow white limo comes up the street.  A necktie has been tied\n  to the antennae like a knight's token.  The MUSIC from La Boheme\n  is BLARING from the car's stereo.  Edward is standing on the\n  car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof.  The\n  wind blows at his hair.  He is smiling.\n\n  Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the\n  PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.\n\n  Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\n  The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.\n  Vivian's landlord comes out the front door.  His eyes go wide\n  in disbelief.\n\n  Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the\n  sunroof.  He leaps nimbly to the ground.  He crosses to the entrance\n  of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.\n\n          VIVIAN\n    You are really lost this time.\n\n  Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.\n\n  With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.\n  She stops at the bottom stair.  Edward comes forward and sweeps\n  her into his arms.  They kiss.\n\n  He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless.  Her feet\n  never touch the ground.\n\n  The car door closes behind them.  The limo drives away.\n\n  The people of the street watch it go.\n\n          THE END\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nPretty Woman\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0J.F.
