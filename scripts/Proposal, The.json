MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n\n          The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of\n          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't\n          watching.\n          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,\n          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET\n          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching \"The O.C.\" on Tivo,\n          and reading a manuscript.\n          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she\n          hits a button to stop the treadmill...\n\n          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n\n          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD\n          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure\n          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same\n          model on the walls.\n          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is\n          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Where are my clothes?\n          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the\n          model on the walls and is really, really hot.\n\n          SIMONE\n          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you\n          some coffee?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.\n          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block\n          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds\n          his pants on the floor and puts them on.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Have you seen my belt?\n          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.\n\n          SIMONE\n          In here.\n          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half\n          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Baby, I just can't do this anymore.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n\n          Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the\n          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves\n          off.\n\n          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n\n          Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly\n          gets dressed as he talks.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You're just too much for me.   And I'm just\n          another guy too wrapped up in his job.\n\n          SIMONE\n          Fine.   Whatever.   Just go.\n          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Let's not end it like that. It's been an\n          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.\n          And you should know that you have the nicest\n          ass I've ever been with.\n\n          SIMONE\n\n          (TOUCHED)\n          You mean it?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I do.   It's magnificent.\n\n          SIMONE\n          I work really hard on it.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I know you do.\n          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her\n          naked body.   Richard shakes his head \"no\" and smiles.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          I really gotta go.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING\n\n          CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while\n          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her\n          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.\n          Her apartment is very quiet.\n\n          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING\n\n          HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the\n          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING\n\n          DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit\n          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL\n          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at\n          her phone as she lets it ring.\n\n          MARGARET\n          (to phone)\n          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me\n          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.\n\n          DOORMAN\n          You have to put it by your mouth so people\n          can hear you.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You should get paid extra for being so darn\n          funny.\n          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out\n          the door.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          This is Margaret.\n\n          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING\n\n          Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.\n\n          INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Two coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,\n          smiles as he hurries to the counter.\n\n          JILLIAN\n          You're running late today.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Jillian, you are the best.\n\n          JILLIAN\n          If you think I'm good at this, you should\n          use that coffee cup sometime.\n          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at\n          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.\n\n          RICHARD\n          See ya tomorrow.\n\n          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n          Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the\n          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One\n          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.\n\n          CO-WORKER #1\n          How long is she gonna make us come in by\n          seven?\n\n          RICHARD\n          She doesn't exactly consult with me on these\n          things.\n\n          CO-WORKER #1\n          Well this sucks ass.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Welcome to my nightmare.\n          The doors close as...\n\n          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING\n\n          Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You've been thinking about our talk because\n          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,\n          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically\n          whores himself.   Know what they have in\n          common?   A Pulitzer.\n          (off answer)\n          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty\n          years, but that's how long it's been since\n          you've written a book this good.\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING\n\n          Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading\n          6:56 and a sign that announces \"Royce Publishing.\"   He hauls ass\n          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees\n          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.\n          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on\n          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he\n          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all\n          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky\n          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.\n\n          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING\n\n          Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees\n          avoid her and pile into the elevator.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,\n          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the\n          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius\n          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.\n          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears \"yes.\"\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          You're making the right decision!   Great\n          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm\n          going to lose you...\n          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their\n          mind.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING\n\n          Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks\n          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,\n          and opens computer programs.\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING\n\n          Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...\n\n          RECEPTIONIST\n          Good morning!\n          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING\n\n          Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,\n          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they\n          stop their \"conversations\" in mid sentence and hang up.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING\n\n          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A\n          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer\n          and Richard grabs it quickly.\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING\n\n          Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing\n          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.\n          Her office looks perfect.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You've got a conference call in thirty, a\n          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration\n          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (big news)\n          I got Frank to do publicity.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nice job.\n\n          MARGARET\n          When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.\n          Is Bob here?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm sure.   You want him on the phone?\n\n          MARGARET\n          We're going to his office.   Grab your pad.\n          Richard calmly backs out of the office...\n\n          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS\n\n          ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer\n          and sends an instant message to the office \"The Banshee is headed\n          to Bob's office.\"\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING\n\n          As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to\n          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes\n          their imaginary conversations.\n\n          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING\n\n          Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup\n          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the\n          hearts that dot the \"I's\" in Jillian.\n\n          MARGARET\n          That's cute.   You gonna call her today?\n\n          RICHARD\n          What?\n          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she\n          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Are you bored here?   Do you need little\n          distractions like that to get you through\n          the day?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Uh...\n\n          MARGARET\n          You have another late night out?\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7.\n          Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried\n          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got\n          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,\n          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You'll magically unwrinkle?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yes.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You have magic pants?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will\n          take care of the wrinkles.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Does this work on more than just your pants?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Anything that's wrinkled.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Buy me some.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Will do.\n          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I don't care what or who you do on your own\n          time, but when you walk through that door\n          you represent me, and I will not have your\n          personal life affect you at work.   If you\n          want me to think of promoting you to editor,\n          I need you sharp, focused and professional.\n          Got it?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Got it.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so\n          don't say a word.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          8.\n\n          INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with\n          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike\n          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.\n          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim\n          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of\n          superiority.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Hey, Bob.\n\n          BOB\n          Ah.   Our fearless leader and her liege.\n          Margaret smiles.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm lettin' you go, Bob.\n\n          BOB\n          Pardon?\n\n          MARGARET\n          You're fired.\n\n          BOB\n          What?   What are you talking about?\n\n          MARGARET\n          This isn't working out.\n\n          BOB\n          You can't...\n\n          MARGARET\n          I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do\n          publicity.   You said it was impossible.\n\n          BOB\n          It is.   He doesn't do publicity.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I just talked to him.   He's in.\n\n          BOB\n          But...\n\n          MARGARET\n          No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a\n          month and a half, and this is the third time\n          you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even\n          call to ask him.\n\n          BOB\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          9.\n\n          MARGARET\n          All you had to do to was pick up the phone.\n          That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to\n          find a new job, and then you can say you\n          resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are\n          sealed.\n          Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.\n\n          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Margaret and Richard walk a few steps.   Margaret looks straight\n          ahead and whispers to Richard.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What's he doing?\n          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair\n          and comes to his door.\n\n          RICHARD\n          He's up and about to pop.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh Bob, don't do it...\n\n          BOB\n\n          YOU POISONOUS BITCH!   YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!\n          The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns\n          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized\n          way out of this.\n\n          BOB\n          This is because I'm your competition.\n          Because I threaten you!\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm\n          firing you because you're lazy, entitled and\n          incompetent.   I'm firing you because you\n          don't work hard.   So if you know what's good\n          for you, you'll shut up, take off that\n          ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get\n          drunk.   Because if you say one more word,\n          Richard here is going to call security and\n          have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we\n          perfectly clear?\n          Bob nods.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          10.\n          Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          We need to call his authors and explain what\n          happened.   And get Frank's publicity\n          schedule figured out pronto.\n\n          RICHARD\n          No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this\n          weekend.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I gave you the weekend off?\n\n          RICHARD\n          It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.\n          But no big deal.   You were right before, I\n          need to stay focused.   Professional.\n\n          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY\n\n          Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come\n          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.\n          (waiting to speak)\n          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.\n          It's not like I volunteered.\n          (waiting to speak)\n          I'm sure dad is pissed.\n          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to\n          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.\n          Richard hangs up the phone.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Sorry about that.   Damage control.\n\n          MARGARET\n          She tell you to quit?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No.   No.\n          (off Margaret's look)\n          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,\n          after three years together, you're the only\n          person on the planet who can make me editor,\n          so that's the way it is.\n          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          11.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Who is this guy?\n\n          RICHARD\n          He said you knew each other.   You weren't\n          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We\n          rescheduled on him four times.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Go get him.   But he's out of here in five\n          minutes, we've got work to do.\n          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (to himself)\n          I'll charge up the cattle prod.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense\n          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy\n          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read\n          about it in P-W.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly,\n          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to\n          know doesn't know already.\n          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,\n          but now gives up.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Have to admit, I can't place where we know\n          each other from.\n          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Three years ago?   We worked together.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Don't have it...\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Remember \"Dandelion's Desire?\"\n          Margaret gets excited.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?\n          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the\n          worst ever written.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You think?\n\n          MARGARET\n          It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and\n          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,\n          who all had some weird disability.   The\n          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering\n          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic\n          alien chapter -- written entirely in his\n          alien language.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          I believe there was a glossary...\n          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n\n          (QUOTING)\n          \"Your grammar is impeccable, but please do\n          not confuse superior form with writing\n          ability.   Save your skills for the office\n          newsletter, you sir, are no writer.\"\n          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...\n\n          MARGARET\n          You wrote the book.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          I did.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You're Dante Dickens?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          One of my nom de plumes.\n          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You\n          obviously were spending a lot of time\n          writing, I just thought you should channel\n          all that passion into something else.\n          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and\n          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you\n          to Canada.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've\n          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for\n          citizenship.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You need citizenship now?   After the big\n          promotion?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yes.   And all the papers are in.\n          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Well, my office is going to reject your\n          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate\n          whether your behavior is well disposed to\n          the good order and happiness of the United\n          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the\n          United States?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will\n          take awhile, so you'll be deported while\n          your case winds through the system.\n          (as if he doesn't know)\n          Will it affect you at work if you aren't\n          allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two\n          to three years?\n\n          MARGARET\n          \"Affect me at work?\"   I'll lose my job!\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          (mock sympathy)\n          Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't\n          work something out.\n          Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Do what, Ms. Mills?\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n          Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          I've edited it down.   It's better.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well then, get it published at another\n          house.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          They all just don't get me.\n\n          MARGARET\n          All?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two\n          hundred sixty-one.   Ish.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'll be fired and laughed out of the\n          industry if I publish that book.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm\n          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a\n          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his\n          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and\n          I'm desperate.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I will never publish your book.   Ever.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          There's no need to make this difficult.   I\n          don't turn in your file until Monday...\n\n          MARGARET\n          This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          I've spent two years preparing for this day.\n          Don't you think I've thought of that?\n          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.\n          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there\n          is an \"emergency\" so Margaret can end the meeting.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs\n          you right away.\n          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson\n          with a wicked grin on her face.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!\n          We're getting married!\n          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Who's getting married?\n\n          MARGARET\n          We are!\n\n          RICHARD\n          You and him?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Stop playing around, honey.\n          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him\n          about us.   About us getting married.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You are marrying your male secretary?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Assistant.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You are marrying your male assistant?\n\n          MARGARET\n          (matter of fact)\n          We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When\n          it's right, it's right.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          And this has nothing to do with my visit\n          here today?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          (to Richard)\n          You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying\n          this... woman?\n          Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Of course we are.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          16.\n          Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret\n          squeezes Richard's hand hard.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Uh-huh.\n          Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm\n          around her.   Richard is truly afraid.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          (more of a question)\n          I'm, uh, marrying my boss?\n          Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that\n          she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together.\n          Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out\n          and kisses the hair on the top of her head.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Five years in prison and a two hundred and\n          fifty thousand dollar fine.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          If I prove you're lying, you go to federal\n          prison for five years.\n          Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.\n          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)\n          (to Richard)\n          You.   Do you know what you're getting\n          yourself into?   We're going to put you in a\n          room and ask you every detail that a real\n          couple would know about each other.   Do you\n          even know her favorite color?\n          Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly\n          veiled threat.\n\n          MARGARET\n          C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice.\n          Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Plum.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You mean purple?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No.   Plum is \"smokier\" than purple.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Favorite flower?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Tulips.   But only when they're in season.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Childhood pet name?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Miss Mittens.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Are we done here?\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Who knows you're getting married?\n          Margaret interrupts.\n\n          MARGARET\n          No one.   With us working together we decided\n          it would be too much of a scandal if anyone\n          knew.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Have you at least told your family?\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (EXCITED)\n          My parents are dead!\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          How convenient.   So you're not telling\n          anyone that you are getting married?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nope.\n          Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got\n          enough to send you to prison...\n\n          MARGARET\n          We're telling his family this weekend.\n\n          RICHARD\n          We are?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...\n          (trying to remember)\n          ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          And where's that going to be?\n\n          MARGARET\n          (no idea)\n          At Richard's parent's house.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          And where's that located?\n\n          MARGARET\n          (still no idea)\n          In his hometown.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Sitka.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Is that on Long Island?\n          Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Why don't you tell him?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Alaska.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You're going to Alaska this weekend?\n\n          MARGARET\n          (Alaska???)\n          Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.\n          That's where Richard is from.\n          Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          You think you can beat me with this B-S\n          story?   Forcing your secretary...\n\n          RICHARD\n          Assistant.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          ...assistant to marry you and then\n          conveniently telling his family for the\n          first time this weekend?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for\n          that?\n          Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          19.\n          Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his\n          appointment book and writes down some information.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          The INS will see you both in ten days for\n          your official interview.   Your stories\n          better match up on every account.\n          Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her\n          the piece of paper.\n          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)\n          Cross all your T's and dot your I's with\n          this ruse, Ms. Mills.\n\n          MARGARET\n          There are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr.\n          Gilbertson.\n          Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to\n          her desk like this is all in a days work.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,\n          that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going\n          to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and\n          girlfriend this weekend for your parents and\n          that should be enough for this INS\n          interview.\n          Richard doesn't react.

He gets up in Margaret's face.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You shut up.

I've worked my ass off for fifteen\n          years and this guy wants to ruin me because\n          he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No\n          way.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that\n          sounds like your problem.   Not mine.\n          Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend,\n          and I'll make you editor.   Deal?\n          Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-\n          bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even\n          have hotels in Alaska?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really.\n          And you have to poop in a bucket.

The banner is being held up by a group of 30\n          PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.\n          Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center.   She's a sweet\n          lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he\n          left the house.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits.

You need to come over here.\n          Like now.   Honey.\n          The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for\n          Margaret to come over.

What?\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          The whole kit and caboodle.\n          Margaret gives both these women a look that says \"what are you\n          talking about?\"\n\n          DEBBIE\n          When Gilber-something told us you were\n          getting married...\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          29.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          ...God rest their souls...\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          ...or friends...\n\n          DEBBIE\n          ...we decided to give you a wedding.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Engagement party tonight...\n\n          DEBBIE\n          ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.\n          Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Are you witches?\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good\n          luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          We've planned everything.\n          Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time\n          left.   Richard lives so far away, and I\n          never see him.   Now I find out he's getting\n          married, and I have a chance to see my one\n          grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come\n          true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let\n          me see Richard get married before I die.\n          Please.\n          Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.\n          Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally,\n          she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.\n          The crowd cheers.\n\n          EXT. SITKA - DAY\n\n          A procession of cars makes its way through town.\n\n          INT. PICKUP - DAY\n\n          Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles.\n          Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible\n          in the backseat of the extended cab.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          30.\n          Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out\n          the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives\n          Margaret a \"what did you do that for\" look.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (MOUTHING)\n          The Dragon Lady!?\n          Richard shrugs.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the\n          plans made already for my birthday.   Just a\n          few changes here and there, and we made this\n          weekend a wedding.\n          Margaret stares at Richard.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm a lucky woman.\n          Margaret does her best to smile.\n\n          EXT. DOCK - DAY\n\n          The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small\n          dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the\n          ocean.   Margaret is confused.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm not getting out of this car until you\n          tell me where we're going.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise.\n          Richard points to a small island about a mile away.\n\n          EXT. YACHT - DAY\n\n          Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and\n          chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is\n          festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Who are you people?\n          Richard lets Margaret wonder.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY\n\n          The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.\n          It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as\n          a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.\n          Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          31.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot\n          about you.   All of it bad.\n          Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical\n          sling backs.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he\n          was marrying the devil woman.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I thought it was the dragon lady?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Either way.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Hey dad.\n          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Welcome home.   Good to see \u00e2\u0080\u0098ya.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You too.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Been a while.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the\n          airport to mark the occasion.\n          Grandma Annie interrupts.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Help him with the bags Geoffrey.\n          (to Richard and Margaret)\n          Let's get you two settled.\n          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots\n          Geoffrey a look that says \"be nice\".\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it\n          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first\n          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          We'll show you around later.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Uh huh.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          32.\n          Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps\n          on her.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Balzac!   Down!   No!\n          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the\n          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small\n          talk.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What a great name.   Balzac's \"Lost\n          Illusions\" is one of my favorite novels.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.\n          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to\n          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.\n          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks\n          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that\n          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.\n          DEBBIE (cont'd)\n          No one on the island wanted him when he was\n          born.   We figured he deserved a home.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          And don't let him outside, or the eagles\n          will snatch him.\n\n          RICHARD\n          C'mon dad...\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I mean it.   They come out of that\n          rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Don't listen to him, Margaret.\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE UPSTAIRS - DAY\n\n          Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          You'll be sleeping here.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the\n          armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          33.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Oh, we took down his \"shrine\" years ago.\n          And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that\n          you two haven't slept in the same bed\n          before.   Richard can sleep here too.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a\n          great grandchild.\n          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his\n          breathing at night.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          I thought so dear.\n          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her\n          old self.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Calm down.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What is going on here?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Hell if I know.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You had no idea they knew about us getting\n          married?\n\n          RICHARD\n          You think I'd bring you here if I did?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well, we just gotta tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em what?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em the truth.   About us.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          34.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Wrong answer.   No way.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.\n\n          RICHARD\n          No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well I don't like this.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice\n          to a Class C felony!   For one second could\n          you not be so selfish?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Selfish?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you\n          only worry about yourself every second of\n          every day?\n\n          MARGARET\n          How is it selfish to tell the truth?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the\n          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...\n          everyone.   We need to protect the people\n          downstairs.   We can't ask these good,\n          decent, not awful people to lie for us.\n          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.\n          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop\n          lying to me.\n\n          RICHARD\n          What've I lied to you about?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Why did you tell me that you were poor?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I never said that.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well, you never told me you were rich.\n\n          RICHARD\n          When does that come up?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          35.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I don't know, how about, \"Hi, my name is\n          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry.\"\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you\n          would have fired me if you knew.\n\n          MARGARET\n          No I wouldn't.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Come on!   You're always yammering on about\n          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought\n          for those soccer scholarships, and how the\n          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for\n          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-\n          rich.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm not anti-rich.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it\n          worse?   You have money!\n\n          MARGARET\n          I earned...\n\n          RICHARD\n          ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.\n          You need new material.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You were going to promote me anyway.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Sure of that?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nope.   Not at all.\n          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well, come on.   If we're going to do this,\n          we might as well put on a show.\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched\n          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-\n          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          36.\n          Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy\n          hair and beards.   No dress code here.\n          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,\n          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows\n          with salmon and king crab.\n          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some\n          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I went to Union college in upstate New York.\n          It's a small liberal arts school that no one\n          has ever heard of.\n          Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (looks at glass)\n          Lime?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Be right back.\n          Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.

Exactly.\n          Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or\n          seventeen years.   Exactly.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          37.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I was never good with big numbers.

Born on May 20th.\n          I'm a Taurus.\n          Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (to Richard)\n          I need some protein.\n\n          RICHARD\n          There's some salmon.\n          Margaret shakes her head no.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Crab?\n          Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.\n          Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he\n          roll over when you whistle?\n          Debbie hits Geoffrey.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          He's just being a good host.\n          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's\n          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.\n          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Uh, sure.   Honey.\n\n          WELL WISHER #2\n          So you just got some big promotion?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm editor in chief, now.\n          Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          (BEAMING)\n          I'm so proud of my girl.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          38.\n          From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.\n\n          VOICE (O.S.)\n          Editor in chief?   You're marrying up,\n          Richard.\n          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is\n          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.

Sure.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm an early, early riser and go for a run\n          everyday.   Well, it was our six month\n          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog\n          in the park, when who do I see in a horse\n          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting\n          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So\n          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what\n          was going on, and he put his finger to his\n          lips and says, \"shhhh.\"   So there I am in my\n          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome\n          mute in the world - have you seen him in a\n          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and\n          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,\n          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best\n          part, we're the only people in the place\n          because Richard got them to open up early.\n          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just\n          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,\n          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,\n          and says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to\n          go by without you knowing that you are the\n          light of my life, and that I would be the\n          luckiest man in the world if you would be my\n          wife.

Geoffrey's just an ass.\n          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink\n          that says \"I've got this under control\".   The moment is\n          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He\n          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Margaret Mill's phone.\n          (off answer)\n          One second please.\n          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          It's our friend, Frank.\n          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Excuse me, I'll just be a second.\n          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that\n          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't\n          notice Balzac follow her outside.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac\n          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the\n          wishy washy writer who changes his mind\n          every two seconds.\n          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING\n          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.\n          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the\n          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (to Balzac)\n          Sit and be quiet!\n          Balzac sits and pouts.

He wasn't doing that.\n          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she\n          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not\n          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him\n          peacefully sit in the grass.\n          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret\n          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --\n          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and\n          takes off.   Margaret jumps.\n          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.\n          She stays calm on the phone.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Could you hold on just a second?\n          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the\n          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and\n          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.\n          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone\n          and picks it up.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n\n          (NONCHALANT)\n          Sorry, dropped my phone.\n          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in\n          circles above her.

This book is your legacy...\n          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac\n          again.

Just as the eagle\n          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone\n          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs\n          Margaret's phone and flies off.

He's been\n          thinking about this moment for a long time.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I could really use your help.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's\n          in New York.   We have jobs.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I know.   I know.   It's just...\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          (CHALLENGING)\n          It's just what?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          You're only a secretary.\n          This pisses Richard off immediately.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Again with the secretary thing!   I've told\n          you, I'm an assistant!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          48.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Just because you call yourself an\n          \"assistant\" doesn't mean you're not really\n          just a secretary.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well if I'm \"just a secretary\", why would\n          you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like\n          you're doing great without me.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          It's not like that and you know it.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Then how is it?   Explain it to me.\n          Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Last week, a man stuck his finger up my\n          butt...\n\n          RICHARD\n          This man was a doctor?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          ...and it got me thinking about you.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm not sure this is coming out right.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Just shut up for a second, okay?   I want you\n          to have what I built.   But I'm running out\n          of time to show you things.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Stop being so dramatic.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I'm not being...\n          (takes a hard line)\n          I need you to stop dicking around down there\n          and get serious.\n\n          RICHARD\n          So this is all about what you want?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          That's not what I said.\n\n          RICHARD\n          And me in New York with Margaret?   That\n          isn't serious?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          49.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the\n          next day she's the love of your life?   How\n          is that serious?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Things change, dad.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n\n          (INDIGNANT)\n          Things change?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Things change.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Things change?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yes.   Things change.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Things change.   That's your explanation?\n          Know what I think?   I think you banged your\n          boss and fell in love, that's what I think.\n          Some sorta mommy complex.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby\n          moments more often.   This is great.\n          Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.\n\n          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY\n\n          Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a\n          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging\n          just over the horizon.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          They can be a little overwhelming, but\n          they're great people.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What?   I'm just working on my tan.\n          (off Gertrude's look)\n          It's been a long day.\n          Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Around the solstice they don't watch the\n          clock.   Pretty much party \u00e2\u0080\u0098til they fall\n          over.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          50.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I actually missed it when I was in the\n          states.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Chicago, right?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Yeah.   Since college.\n\n          MARGARET\n          And now you're back?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love\n          it.   Think I'm back for good.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators?\n          Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.\n          GERTRUDE (cont'd)\n          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I\n          never thought I'd end up divorced and back\n          here teaching at my old elementary school.\n          That was always Richard's plan.\n\n          MARGARET\n          For you to get divorced?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          (smiles, remembering)\n          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to\n          run his dad's business.   He was like a\n          little old man.   Had it all worked out.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Are we talking about the same guy?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          What do you mean?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well, Richard's such a player.\n          Gertrude looks confused.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          I mean he was a total player.   Before we\n          started dating.   Six months ago.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          51.\n\n          MARGARET\n          That surprises you?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Did he ever tell you why we broke up?\n\n          MARGARET\n          We don't really talk much about stuff like\n          that.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Oh.   Well I should shut up...\n\n          MARGARET\n          No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting\n          married.   I want to know these things.\n          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          He proposed to me.   When we were seniors.\n          Margaret laughs.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed\n          to you in high school?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          He bought this sweet little ring, and got\n          down on his knee.   It was so cute.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You must have...\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up\n          with him on the spot.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I would hope so.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          After getting rejected the first time, I\n          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get\n          up the courage to ask you.\n          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is\n          being so honest with her.\n          GERTRUDE (cont'd)\n          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man\n          could be a player...   It's just not the\n          Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an\n          honest man of him again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          52.\n          Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in\n          one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.\n          GERTRUDE (cont'd)\n          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get\n          another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,\n          let's get back to the girls.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'll be right in.\n          Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside.\n          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          We are awful people.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands\n          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find\n          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after\n          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage\n          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.\n          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.\n          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's\n          mood deflates when she sees Richard.\n\n          DEBBIE\n\n          (SHOUTING)\n          Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK?\n          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear\n          or see the girls.\n          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY\n\n          Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch\n          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step\n          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the\n          door, not sure what is going on.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Excuse me?   I'm watching that.\n\n          ANNIE\n          Why is Richard chopping wood?\n\n          DEBBIE\n          And don't play dumb.   What did you do?\n          Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          53.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you\n          please move.\n          The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I am so tired.\n          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.\n          Margaret just smiles.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Think I'm going to take a shower and clean\n          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for\n          a great night.\n          Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once\n          she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He\n          looks genuinely unnerved.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Stop looking at me like that!\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite\n          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through\n          shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY\n\n          Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and\n          shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower.\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY\n\n          Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great\n          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but\n          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and\n          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the\n          playlist \"Songs I Shouldn't Like\" and Charlene's hit \"I've Been\n          to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me.\"\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY\n\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches\n          for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative\n          hand towel.   Shit.\n\n          IN THE BEDROOM\n          Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings \"...I've been\n          undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          54.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Margaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she\n          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Richard, is that you?\n\n          IN THE BEDROOM\n          Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an\n          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard\n          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting\n          for her.   How did she miss that?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Richard, are you...\n          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles\n          Margaret.\n\n          BALZAC\n          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!\n          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot\n          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.\n\n          ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK\n          Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on\n          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in\n          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret\n          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel\n          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.\n          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs\n          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.\n\n          ON THE BEDROOM DECK\n          Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is\n          open.   That's weird.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          55.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,\n          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues\n          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows\n          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then\n          she spots the bathroom mat.\n\n          IN THE BEDROOM\n          Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM\n          Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.\n          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.\n          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls\n          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the\n          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the\n          door behind her and...\n\n          IN THE BEDROOM\n          WHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.\n          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each\n          other buck naked.\n\n          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD\n          Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n          The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A\n          rapid fire back and forth ensues.\n\n          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD\n          Why are you naked?                                                   Why are you wet?\n\n          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD\n          Don't look at me!

You're blaming the dog again?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Will you just hand me a towel!\n          Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks\n          under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          You're flashing brain!\n          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls\n          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,\n          and she wraps herself in it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          56.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          You can cover up any time!\n          Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by\n          the window.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Explain yourself!\n\n          RICHARD\n          I didn't know you were home!   I was outside\n          chopping wood!\n\n          MARGARET\n          You didn't hear me?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I had my iPod on!\n\n          (CONFUSED)\n          Why did you jump me?\n          Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I didn't jump you.\n          (off Richard's look)\n          I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know\n          you were here.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You didn't see me?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I was running from the dog!\n          Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Wait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Mmm-Hmmm.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Go take a shower.   You stink.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there.\n          You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual\n          harassment.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          57.\n          Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes\n          a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up\n          again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his\n          neck.   He gently puts him outside their room.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before\n          she makes a coat out of you.\n          Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without\n          looking back, Richard gets the final shot.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Puppy hater.\n\n          LATER\n          Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find\n          to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.\n          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with\n          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm never gonna to get to sleep.\n          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down\n          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and\n          the room is pitch black.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.\n          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two\n          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.\n\n          RICHARD\n          It was kinda weird seeing you naked.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Can we not talk about this?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm just saying.   It was weird.\n\n          MARGARET\n          It wasn't weird.\n\n          RICHARD\n          How was that not weird?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Because we're... like teammates.\n\n          RICHARD\n          We're like teammates?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          58.\n\n          MARGARET\n          We are teammates.   And teammates see each\n          other naked in the locker room.   All the\n          time.   It's not a big deal.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the\n          bed?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Good night, Richard.\n          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Margaret?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yes?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Don't take this the wrong way.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Okay...\n\n          RICHARD\n          You're a very beautiful woman.\n          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.\n\n          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into\n          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic\n          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code\n          on a piece of paper.   He dials.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey\n          Paxton...\n          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the\n          rest of the conversation.\n\n          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY\n\n          Margaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor\n          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,\n          before there is a KNOCK on the door.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Who is it?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          59.\n\n          DEBBIE (O.S.)\n          It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in\n          bed.   Can I come in?\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (STALLING)\n          Uh, sure.   Just a second.\n          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden\n          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.\n\n          RICHARD\n          What the...\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (MOUTHING)\n          Your mother.\n          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his\n          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts\n          his arm around Margaret.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Come on in mom!\n          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Well, it's your special day.\n          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on\n          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.\n          DEBBIE (cont'd)\n          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've\n          got your dress fitting, have to get the\n          house ready, and then your wedding.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new\n          phone.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Will you pick up some champagne while you're\n          there?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No problem.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of\n          work to be done!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          60.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You don't have to go to all this trouble.\n          Really.\n          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of\n          your life.   You are coming into this family,\n          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If\n          your parents were with us, they would do the\n          exact same.\n          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard\n          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (TOUCHED)\n          Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had\n          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was\n          a little kid.\n          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (mouth full)\n          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught\n          us.   Damn, that was close.\n          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay\n          attention to Margaret.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You just take all this for granted?   Your\n          family, this house...\n          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (mouth full)\n          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.\n          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Why are you doing this to them?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Huh?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me\n          here.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You made me bring you here!   You told me I\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          61.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I didn't make you do anything.   You could of\n          said no.\n\n          RICHARD\n          And what?   Start over at the bottom again?\n          No way.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I get why a not rich person would do this.\n          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make\n          any sense.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Know what?   This is none of your business.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I wish it wasn't my business.   But\n          unfortunately, it has become my business,\n          because I made a deal with someone I thought\n          I could trust.\n          Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show\n          you why you're here.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Fine.\n\n          RICHARD\n          We leave in a half hour.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'll be ready in 20 minutes.\n          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it\n          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for\n          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          These are really good.\n          She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY\n\n          Richard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes\n          and running shoes.\n\n          EXT. BOAT - DAY\n\n          Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          62.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY\n\n          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in\n          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large\n          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the\n          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be\n          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.\n          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS\n          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.\n          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK\n          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.\n\n          BEK BEK\n          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yes sir, it is!\n\n          BEK BEK\n          (to Margaret)\n          You look much younger than everyone says.\n\n          MARGARET\n          That's great to hear.\n\n          RICHARD\n          See ya on the line, Bek Bek.\n\n          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\n          Richard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Put this on.   I'll meet you outside.\n\n          MARGARET\n          But I don't...\n\n          RICHARD\n          Ah.   Put it on.\n\n          EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\n          Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's\n          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing\n          boots, and gloves.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Is this really necessary?\n\n          RICHARD\n          You'll thank me later.\n          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          63.\n\n          INT. SLIME LINE - DAY\n\n          Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different\n          stations process the fish that come off the boats.\n          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head\n          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a\n          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves\n          when he sees Margaret and Richard.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Why is he handcuffed to the machine?\n\n          RICHARD\n          So his hands don't go too far.   So he\n          doesn't...\n          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Nice.\n          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where\n          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a\n          vegetarian for six months in college.\n          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long\n          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are\n          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller\n          line and clean out all the left over intestines.\n\n          WORKER\n          There he is!   Big city boy come to show us\n          how its done.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Ah, it's been a while.\n\n          WORKER\n          C'mon.   Show her how we do it.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Okay, okay.\n          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly\n          demonstrates with a knife.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you\n          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt\n          the knife, and then pull with the grain of\n          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the\n          organs attached to the spine.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          64.\n          Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the\n          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down\n          the line.\n          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before\n          offering a knife to Margaret.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Wanna try it?\n          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          If it's too gross for you...\n\n          MARGARET\n          Gimme that.\n          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.\n          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible\n          between her and the salmon.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me\n          to earn my stripes before I took over.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Is that why you're still pissed at him?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nah, I loved it here.\n\n          MARGARET\n          (re: fish guts)\n          You loved this?\n\n          RICHARD\n          The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the\n          slime line.   I loved this place.   The\n          people.   Growing up, running this place was\n          all I wanted.\n          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (DISGUSTED)\n          You wanted this?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I wanted to run this place. It was\n          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.\n          (re: fish)\n          Don't forget the spine.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          65.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I wasn't gonna forget.\n          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on\n          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.\n\n          RICHARD\n          But then things changed.

She's heard this a hundred times.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          No Top Gun.   Please.\n\n          RICHARD\n          What?   You loved my Top Gun.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled\n          and laughed like a good girlfriend.\n\n          RICHARD\n          That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous.\n          Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise.\n          Gertrude is not impressed.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n\n          (LAUGHING)\n          Really.   Stop.\n\n          RICHARD\n          That cuts deep.   I'll have you know that\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76.\n          Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          (noticing her change in mood)\n          Uh, is something wrong?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          No.   Nothing's wrong.\n\n          RICHARD\n          It's been awhile, but I can still tell when\n          something's wrong with you.\n          Gertrude doesn't want to say anything.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          What is it?   You know I hate it when you get\n          all quiet.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I wish there was a better way to say this.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Better way to say what?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking\n          up with you.   I'm sorry.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Are you apologizing for high school?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Yes.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh, thank God.   I thought this was like,\n          something big.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          This is something big.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I coulda used this about five years ago, but\n          I'm all good now, promise.   Thank you for\n          saying that, though.\n          Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point.   She pulls\n          herself together.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I think...\n          (looking down)\n          I want you back.\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          77.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          (more to herself)\n          Oh God, he's making me say it again.\n          (looking at Richard)\n          I want you back.   Like... we should be\n          together.   All the time.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Rewind.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I know this isn't the best time to bring\n          this up.\n\n          RICHARD\n\n          (RHETORICAL)\n          My wedding day isn't the best time for you\n          to bring up the idea of us dating?\n          Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.\n          Bringing this up is very hard for her.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I'm not talking about dating!   You should\n          move back here.   We can have the life you\n          always talked about in High School.   I'm\n          ready for that now.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Why are you doing this?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          I know that the timing here sucks.   But we\n          are meant to be together.   I know it.   I\n          think you know it too...\n\n          RICHARD\n          No, I don't.   I don't know it.\n          Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he\n          opens his mouth, he can't find the words.\n          Then, from the door, an interruption.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Hey guys.\n          Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing\n          away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but\n          look guilty as hell.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Oh.   Hey Margaret.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Uh, you all done?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          78.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   We'll see what he says.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Great.   Great.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You ready to get back to the house?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well let's go.   See you at the wedding,\n          Gertrude.\n          Gertrude just smiles.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Yeah.   See you at the wedding.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY\n\n          Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking\n          about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.\n\n          MARGARET\n          So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?\n          Richard lies.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and\n          stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher\n          was a pot head.\n\n          MARGARET\n          That was it?   I was gone for awhile...\n\n          RICHARD\n          (cuts her off)\n          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do\n          this.   You should really go try on the dress\n          for my mom.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I was going to go for a run first, it's been\n          three days since I got out, I'm feeling\n          crazy.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (could care less)\n          Whatever.\n          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but\n          doesn't push it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          79.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY\n\n          Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running\n          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's\n          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her\n          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What now?\n          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She\n          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN\n          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a\n          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as\n          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song\n          that sounds centuries old.\n\n          SHAMAN\n          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik\n          pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani\n          takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.\n          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.\n          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.\n          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.\n          SHAMAN (cont'd)\n          Margaret, welcome!\n          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.\n          SHAMAN (cont'd)\n          Come to me, Margaret of New York.\n          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.\n          SHAMAN (cont'd)\n          It is I, father Paxton.\n          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.\n\n          MARGARET\n          What, ah, are you doing?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and\n          clear my head.   As you know, things have\n          been a little crazy around here.   You should\n          join me.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Ya know, I've got to get back.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          You closed minded southerners amuse me.\n          Never willing to leave the nest and try\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          80.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm a big fan of the nest.\n          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you\n          deny my circle.\n          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.\n\n          MARGARET\n          OK, OK.   I \"accept your circle.\"\n          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Clear your mind and follow me.\n          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret\n          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After\n          a few moments, Margaret stops.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm gonna head back.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          We're not done.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I think I am.\n          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Margaret?\n          Margaret stops and turns around.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But\n          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.\n          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          Thank you.\n          (switching gears)\n          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik\n          pifiksailiriju m 1k...\n          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and\n          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still\n          painfully awkward.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          81.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut\n          qangalan uarm.\n          Geoffrey speeds up the dance.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          Now you.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Me what?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Chant.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Chant what?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the\n          way.   You'll feel better.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I can't...\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Close your eyes.   Chant.\n          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,\n          but can't figure out what to say.\n          GEOFFREY (cont'd)\n          Chant!\n\n          MARGARET\n          I don't know any chants!\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Chant!\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (GUTTERAL)\n          Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...\n          Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low\n          noise.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Chant!\n          The drum beat continues.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          82.\n          They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...to the wall...\n          More sand.   More fire.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...to sweat drop down my balls...\n          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...to all these bitches crawl...\n          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken\n          out into a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lil John song.   She continues to dance.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...\n          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...all skee skee got damn...\n          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Geoffrey!\n          Margaret stops chanting \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lil John.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.\n          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Is she singing about balls?\n\n          MARGARET\n          He told me I had to chant!\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do\n          this!\n          (to Margaret)\n          He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          He does this to keep in touch with \"his\n          people\".\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          83.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Don't make fun of my heritage!   And it was\n          helping.   Don't you feel better?   I feel\n          better.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned\n          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And\n          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and\n          help us with this wedding.\n          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and\n          the drum beat stops.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Fine.\n          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.\n\n          INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master\n          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          I am so excited.   Aren't you excited?\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made\n          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back\n          into style.   How does it fit?\n          Margaret speaks through the door.\n\n          MARGARET (O.S.)\n          Just buttoning up here.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Drum roll!\n          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.\n          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but\n          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah, it's a little snug.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          Come over here.\n          Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          84.\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (ADMITTING)\n          It's a lovely dress.\n          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          (through the tears)\n          You're so beautiful, and such a great match\n          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,\n          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at\n          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy\n          I get to share your day.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          You're right.\n          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.\n          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          Go!\n          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in\n          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          Had to get rid of her before I gave you\n          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.\n          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around\n          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays\n          on Margaret's neck.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but\n          I didn't want to take any chances.\n\n          MARGARET\n          It's beautiful.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue\n          ones like this are very rare.   My great\n          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother\n          when they were married.   They were quite a\n          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she\n          was Tlingit.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          85.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          Back then, you had to get approval from\n          every person in the tribe before you got\n          married.   It almost broke them up.\n\n          MARGARET\n          How'd they stay together?\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,\n          none of us would be here if they hadn't.\n          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          I want you to have it.\n          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing\n          from Annie.\n\n          MARGARET\n          No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          I don't want to hear it.   It's yours.\n          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away\n          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like\n          we'll always be a part of your life, even\n          after we're gone. Take it.\n          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time\n          feels like a complete and total fraud.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          Are you feeling all right, dear?\n          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well.   Thing is...\n          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          ...the dress is just a little tight.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these\n          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.\n          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.\n          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\n          We can fix this no problem.\n          Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in\n          a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.\n\n          MARGARET\n          We need to talk.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm a little busy.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away\n          from here.   From everyone.   Now.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Go for another run.\n\n          MARGARET\n          No!   I did that.   It did not help.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm a little tired of you making demands and\n          me just jumping...\n\n          MARGARET\n          (re: wedding stuff)\n          We're not going to need any of this if I\n          don't get out of here.\n\n          RICHARD\n          OK, high maintenance.   Let's go.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY\n\n          Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and\n          maneuverability. Richard starts her up.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Move over, I'm driving.\n          Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You don't know where we're going.\n          Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.\n\n          MARGARET\n          It doesn't matter.\n\n          ON THE OPEN OCEAN\n          Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the\n          horizon.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87.\n          As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,\n          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the\n          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it\n          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.\n          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep\n          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an\n          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Where are we?\n\n          RICHARD\n          The north pole.   Congratulations, we made\n          it.\n          (off Margaret's look)\n          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better\n          let me take it from here.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm fine.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot\n          of glacier fields?   And not died?\n          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Lady, you've got issues.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.\n\n          RICHARD\n          It doesn't stop there.\n\n          MARGARET\n          This coming from the sociopath.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh, please.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'd never bring me here.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You drove!\n\n          MARGARET\n          I mean to Alaska.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Are you kidding me?\n          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You're sick.   Doing this to them.\n\n          RICHARD\n          I explained to you...\n\n          MARGARET\n          They love you.   Do you get that?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Of course.\n\n          MARGARET\n          And you're still willing to lie to them?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Like you didn't know.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Didn't know what?\n\n          RICHARD\n          That we were going to lie to them.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I didn't know!\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well that makes you either stupid, or\n          ignorant.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You think I'm stupid?\n\n          RICHARD\n          No, but what's behind door number two...\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (SCREAMS)\n          I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!\n\n          RICHARD\n          Forgot what?\n\n          MARGARET\n          What it was like!\n\n          RICHARD\n          What what was like?\n\n          MARGARET\n          To have a family!   I forgot what it was like\n          to have a family.   I've been on my own since\n          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was\n          like to have people that love you, and make\n          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89.\n          Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of\n          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          I'm going to take a walk.\n\n          RICHARD\n          We need to head back...\n\n          MARGARET\n          Alone.   I need alone time.\n\n          RICHARD\n          What?\n          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.\n          I need a second.\n\n          RICHARD\n          But...\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (PANICKED)\n          Stop right there!\n          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.\n          Just sit down, turn around, and act like\n          you're not here.\n          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down\n          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks\n          away from him on the glacier.\n\n          ON THE GLACIER\n          Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (manic, to herself)\n          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and\n          then you'll never see these people again.\n          Eventually you'll write a letter.\n          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (from the boat)\n          Margaret!\n\n          MARGARET\n          No talking!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (from the boat)\n          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Again, you're not supposed to be...\n          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.\n\n          ON THE BOAT\n          Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her\n          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (back still turned)\n          Margaret?\n          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.\n          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the\n          direction he last saw Margaret.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking \"the rules\"\n          here, but where are you?\n          He takes one more step before he hears...\n\n          MARGARET (O.S.)\n\n          (YELLING)\n          Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!\n          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her\n          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --\n          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out\n          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and\n          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Oh, thank God!\n          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.\n          Margaret is really scared.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?\n\n          RICHARD\n          I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll\n          get you out of there.   You've broken through\n          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No\n          biggie.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Don't do that.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          91.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Don't do what?\n\n          MARGARET\n          The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they\n          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to\n          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do\n          that!\n\n          RICHARD\n          It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to\n          be careful here though, I don't want us both\n          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Uh-huh.\n          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the\n          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.\n\n          RICHARD\n          So, I'm going to walk up to you and very\n          slowly pull you out.   OK?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm really cold.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded\n          by ice.\n\n          MARGARET\n          (makes sense)\n\n          OK.\n          Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to\n          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.\n\n          RICHARD\n          So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.\n          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't\n          freak out.\n          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly\n          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          When I get you all the way out, I need you\n          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you\n          over there.\n          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's\n          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her \"over\n          the threshold\" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks\n          once they're safe.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          92.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          I've, uh, never done that before.\n\n          MARGARET\n          You said it was \"no biggie\".\n\n          RICHARD\n          Yeah.   Well.   You OK?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   I'm fine.\n          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.\n          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits\n          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n\n          (SMILING)\n          You shouldn't of laughed at me.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You woulda laughed at me.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   While I was getting my camera.\n          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.\n          They might kiss.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Gertrude wants me back.\n          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.\n\n          MARGARET\n          And?\n\n          RICHARD\n          Well.   It seemed like you were having...\n          second thoughts.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yeah.   I was.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Maybe we should do it.   Come clean.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Put me down.\n          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain\n          her composure.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          You wanna call it off?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          93.\n\n          RICHARD\n          If you do.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we\n          get back.\n\n          ON THE BOAT\n          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.\n          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above\n          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting\n          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a\n          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Come with me.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          Not now.   C'mon.\n          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.\n          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY\n\n          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the\n          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          (to Richard)\n          I haven't told your mother about any of\n          this, and I don't plan to.\n          (to Margaret)\n          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry\n          about this.\n          Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.\n\n          INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE\n          The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the\n          middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding\n          chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          94.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (to Dad)\n          What did you do?\n          Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself.\n          RICHARD (cont'd)\n          (getting angry)\n          What did you do, dad?!\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          I called him yesterday.   He told me that you\n          were lying, and that he was going to catch\n          you.   That he was going to send you to\n          prison.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          (to Richard)\n          We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now\n          you tell the truth, and get off scott free.\n          It's like it never happened for you.\n\n          RICHARD\n          You made a deal with him?   On my behalf?\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          You were making a mistake...\n\n          RICHARD\n          That's none of your business.\n\n          MARGARET\n          It's fine.\n\n          RICHARD\n          The hell it is.   It is not fine!\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what\n          really happened, and I'll be on my way.

Tell him.\n\n          RICHARD\n          (to Geoffrey)\n          You do not get to make this decision.   This\n          is my decision.\n          (to Gilbertson)\n          The truth is... I've been working for\n          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we\n          started dating.   I recently asked her to\n          marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          95.\n\n          GEOFFREY\n          What are you doing, Richard?\n\n          RICHARD\n          (grabs Margaret's hand)\n          Come on, we gotta get ready.\n          Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The couple walks briskly to the house.\n\n          RICHARD\n          What was I thinking?   They act like they're\n          nice, but really, they're evil.\n\n          MARGARET\n          He's only doing it because he loves you.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Are you defending him?   Are you defending\n          the king dick?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Just stop.   Think about this.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I\n          think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank\n          you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is\n          the best thing that's ever happened to me.\n          Without this, I might've ended up back here.\n          Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.\n\n          DEBBIE\n          There you are!   You two almost gave me a\n          heart attack.

MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY\n\n          Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside.   We see Margaret\n          from head to toe.   The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is\n          perfect.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Matches the shoes.\n          Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Those'll be your best friend.

PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.\n          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the\n          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.\n          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.\n          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who\n          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads \"Kool and\n          the Gang, Cherish\".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to\n          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.\n          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.\n\n          MARGARET\n          (mouthing to Richard)\n          Nice song.\n          Richard shrugs his shoulders.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          Is that your song, dear?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I guess so.\n          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,\n          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.

She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in\n          order to keep himself seated.\n          RAMONE (cont'd)\n          For it is family and friends who taught\n          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only\n          right that family and friends all celebrate\n          that love here today.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          98.\n          RAMONE (cont'd)\n          And if there is anyone who has cause why\n          this couple should not be united in marriage\n          and love, they must speak now or forever\n          hold their peace.\n          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.\n          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.\n          He's not sure what to do.\n          RAMONE (cont'd)\n          Mi amo, do you have a question?\n          We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted\n          shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.\n\n          MARGARET\n          No.\n\n          RAMONE\n          Then why is your hand up?\n\n          MARGARET\n          I have something to say.   It's not a\n          question though.\n\n          RAMONE\n          Can it wait \u00e2\u0080\u0098til after?\n\n          MARGARET\n          Uh.   Um.

I made Richard marry me.   This is\n          all a sham.\n          Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          99.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          I was going to get kicked out of the country\n          -- so I told Richard that I would destroy\n          his career if he didn't marry me.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Now wait...\n\n          MARGARET\n          Richard.

This is all my fault.\n          (to Ramone)\n          Could you get the band started?   And give\n          these people something to drink.\n          (to Gilbertson)\n          And you.

She stops when she gets\n          to Gertrude and leans down.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Take care of him.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Promise.\n          Margaret walks back into the house.

Getting Frank to do the publicity\n          tour doesn't mean much right now.\n\n          MARGARET\n          Yup.   He's in.

You're perfect for each other.\n\n          RICHARD\n          But... but what about you?

She turns to Richard.\n          Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n\n          (SINCERE)\n          Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good\n          person.   You deserve it.\n          She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but\n          Margaret denies it.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Goodbye, Richard.\n\n          EXT.

BOAT - DAY\n\n          Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her\n          suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.\n          The two have to yell to talk.\n\n          MR.

GILBERTSON\n          Say it.\n          Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'll publish your book.\n          Gilbertson smiles.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          Now was that so hard?\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY\n\n          Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.\n          Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          So here's the deal.

Then, realizing\n          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to\n          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the\n          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.\n          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.\n          Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong.\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          You have been practicing.\n\n          RICHARD\n          Waddya mean?\n\n          GERTRUDE\n          Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned\n          into bit of a man whore down there.\n          Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.

And\n          you're under arrest for disobeying a crew\n          member, assault, and possible intoxication.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          114.\n          The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around\n          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then\n          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.\n          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)\n          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need\n          to get this unruly passenger off the plane\n          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if\n          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain\n          turn this bird around.\n          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.\n          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)\n          (winks at Margaret)\n          Told you I was a romantic.\n\n          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY\n\n          Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family\n          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives\n          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.\n          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.\n\n          MARGARET\n          This wasn't supposed to happen.\n          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.\n\n          RICHARD\n          But it did.\n          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.\n\n          MARGARET\n          I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.\n          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and\n          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.\n          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.\n\n          HANDSOME MAN\n          Uh, sorry, but excuse us.\n          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson\n          down the steps.\n\n          MARGARET\n          (to Gilbertson)\n          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might\n          affect you at work?\n          Gilbertson has no retort.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          115.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish\n          your book after all.\n\n          MR. GILBERTSON\n          So you are getting married this weekend?\n\n          MARGARET\n\n          (SMILING)\n          Absolutely not.   But who knows?\n          (looking at Richard)\n          We might by the time you get out of jail.\n          Gilbertson makes a \"go to hell\" face and shuffles off.\n          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          I've got some explaining to do.\n          Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of\n          Richard's family.\n          MARGARET (cont'd)\n          (to Debbie)\n          Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for\n          years, but we've just recently begun to see\n          each other romantically.\n          (to Geoffrey)\n          I want to get to know you all, and spend\n          some real time up here in Alaska.\n          (to Annie)\n          I'm not sure when you are going to see him\n          get married, but I promise as long as I'm\n          with him, he'll be happy.\n          Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.\n\n          GRANDMA ANNIE\n          That's all we ever wanted.\n          Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins\n          in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. PAXTON ISLAND - DANCEFLOOR - DAY\n\n          The party is in full swing.\n          Balzac chases his balls.\n          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a\n          beautiful voice.\n          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          116.\n          Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The\n          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and\n          leaves these two alone.\n          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't\n          very good.\n          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the\n          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,\n          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's\n          phone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          THE END\n\n          \n \n\n\n\nProposal, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Pete Chiarelli\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:23.646743"}
