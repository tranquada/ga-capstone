Other\n        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.\n\n        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin\n        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire\n        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound\n        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising\n        scream of animal agony.\n\n        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.\n\n<b>                                               CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>5A/FX   OMITTED                                                5A/FX\n</b>\n<b>6       OMITTED                                                6\n</b>\n\n<b>7       EXT.

The\n        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering\n        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through\n        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the\n        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same\n        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure\n        slumps, motionless.\n\n        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.

They do a double take\n        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,\n        completely jaded.

His eyes snap open.\n\n        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.\n        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.\n        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising\n        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two\n        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-\n        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant\n        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.\n\n        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the\n        floor.\n        Slams up against one wall.\n        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.\n        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-\n        ing down.\n\n        C.U. - SARAH, very still.

Kyle's eyes\n        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.\n        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and\n        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.\n        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.\n        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED\n        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls\n        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.\n\n        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.\n\n        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,\n        beyond the debris from the explosion.\n        She starts to crawl toward it.\n        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.\n\n        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!\n        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with\n        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted\n        metal.\n\n<b>        IT LUNGES FOR HER!\n</b>\n        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her\n        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.\n\n        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel\n        fingers clutching.\n\n        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,\n        crawling in agony.\n\n        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk\n        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate\n        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going\n        under a set of sorting rollers.\n\n        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls\n        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,\n<b>        EYES GLOWING.\n</b>\n        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.\n        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and\n        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.\n\n        The Terminator clambers through after her.\n\n        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches\n        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.\n        She drags herself toward it.\n\n        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny\n        crawl space.  No way out.\n\n        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.\n        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.\n        She is jammed in a corner.\n        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,\n        seeking the RED BUTTON.\n\n<b>        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.\n</b>\n        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.\n\n        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in\n        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep\n        from screaming as she WAITS.\n\n        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush\n        the life out of her and end its long mission.\n\n<b>                                SARAH\n</b>                           (voice icy)\n                      You're...terminated...fucker!\n\n        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.\n\n        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the\n<b>        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.\n</b><b>        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!\n</b>        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head\n        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.\n        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-\n        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the\n        Terminator's energy is released in one second.\n\n        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:\n        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.\n        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers\n        are frozen an inch from her throat.

The sky scowls with an impending\n        storm.\n\n        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-\n        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She\n        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of\n        her SWOLLEN BELLY.\n        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.\n        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster\n        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her\n        breast.
