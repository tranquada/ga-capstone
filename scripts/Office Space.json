It's Na-\ngee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>At least your name isn't Michael Bolton.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>There was nothing wrong with it. Until I was about nine years old and \nthat no-talent assclown became famous and started winning Grammys.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Well, why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b><b> WHY SHOULD I CHANGE IT?

I'm \ndoing it because, because, uh, I'm a big pussy. Which is why I work at \nInitech to begin with.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Uh, I work at Initech and I don't consider myself a pussy, ok?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yes, I am also not a pussy.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I'm gonna find out the hard way that I'm not a pussy if they don't \nstart treating us software people better.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>That's right.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>They don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip \nthat place off big time\u0085big time.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\nCut to Joanna, a pretty waitress.\n\nCut back to the guys.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh, there she is.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Peter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with \nher, why don't you just ask her out?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a \nwaitress and ask her out. \n(cut to Joanna, and back to them) \nPlus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. \nI'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Why not?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just \nthink, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah. I know what you mean.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What is that supposed to mean?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you \nwant to play poker with us?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I \nthink the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Peter, she's anorexic.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, I know. The guy's really good.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of \nyour problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you \nhaving problems with your TPS reports?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?\n\nPeter sighs.\n\n[Scene Outside Initech. Tom, another employee, runs across the street, \ntowards Samir, Peter and Michael.]\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!!\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Is that Tom Smykowski?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What's he doing?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Oh, probably working on another heart attack.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Have you guys see this?\n\nHe hands them a piece of paper.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What? It's the staff meeting. So what?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this \nstaff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year. \nYou have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency \nexperts. You're interviewing for your own job!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought \nof having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in \nline with those scumbags!!!\n\n[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Shit. Shit.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with \nall this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see, \nthat's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with \nsome really great idea like that and you never have to work again!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>The guy made a million dollars! Y'know\u0085 I had an idea like that once.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Really? What was it, Tom?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well, all right. It was a Jump\u0085 to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would \nbe this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different \nconclusions written on it that you could\u0085jump to.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yes, yes, it's horrible\u0085this idea\u0085.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I \nstill have a job.\n\nHe goes to his cubicle.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if \nwe had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably, \nwhatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you \nwanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>So what did you say?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to \nbegin with. \n(The printer is not working) \nIf that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would \nclean shit up if they had a million dollars.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest \nof it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you \nwant to do. And then\u0085\n(reads the printer's display) \n\"PC load letter\"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!!\n\nHe knocks off the paper tray.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch. \nHe then turns on the TV.]\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b><b>(V/O, FROM NEXT DOOR) \n</b><b>HEY PETER-MAN! CHECK OUT CHANNEL NINE! IT'S THE BREAST EXAM! CHECK OUT \n</b><b>THIS CHICK!\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>Lawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through \nthe wall?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Oh! I'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>No! But if you just want to talk to me, just come over.\n\nLawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Hey man. Check this out, dude.\n\nHe changes channels a bunch of times\n\nPepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast \nexam.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh geez, Lawrence.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look \nlike Anne?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, a little bit.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I guess, yeah. I, I don't know. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's \ncheating on me.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Yeah, I get that feeling too, man.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What do you mean by that?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>I don't know , man, I just get that feeling looking at her, like - I'm \nsorry, man. Look, I, I, I, I, I, I'm talking out of my ass. I don't \nknow.\n\nHe gets up.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's ok. I just had a rough day.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Tell me about it, man. \n(sits on the couch)\n I gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag \nmyself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the \nnew McDonalds.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Let me ask you something. When you come in on Mondays, and you're not \nfeeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say \"sounds like \nsomeone's got a case of the Mondays\"?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>No. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you get your ass kicked for \nsayin' something like that, man.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Huh.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>We still going fishing this weekend?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Nah. Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Well, you can get out of that easily.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, how?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>(Gets up) \nWell, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of \nthe day, right? \n(gets a beer) \nSo all you have to do is avoid him \u0096 \n(peter offers him a bottle cap remover) \nThat's all right, i got one \u0096 \n(he gets on from his pocket) \nThe last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you \nshould be home free then.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you \ndo if you had a million dollars?\n\nHe sits down.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>I'll tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.\n\nPeter laughs.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two \nchicks at the same time?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Damn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a \nmillionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks dig guys with money.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well not all chicks\u0085.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Well, the type that double up on a guy like me do.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Good point.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b><b>NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>Besides two chicks at the same time?\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Oh yeah.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Nothing.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Nothing, huh?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man.

Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37. \nEveryone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says \n\"Is This Good for the COMPANY?\"]\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points \nto the banner) Is this good for the company?

So, \ny'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and \njeans.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with \nPeter.]\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told \nBill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting. \nI'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk \nfour times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels \nand they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the \nBoston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red \nSwingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston \nand I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok, Milton.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on \nfire.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh, that's great. I will talk to you later.\n\nHe hangs up and looks at his watch\n\n4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill \ntalking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the \ncomputer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh, come on! (it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh, \nfor crying out -!\n\nHe peeks over the wall again. The computer finally finished saving and \nhe turns it off. He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there. He gets \nready to leave and almost runs into Bill.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Hello Peter. What's happening? Um, I'm gonna need you go ahead and come \nin tomorrow. So if you could be here around nine, that would be great. \n(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yea\u0085I forgot. I'm gonna also need you to \ncome in Sunday too.

I want you to relax every muscle \nin your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now I want you to \nrelax your legs. You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting \nheavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete \nrelaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing.

Would you like to have \nlunch with me?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do \nthat.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a \ntable and if you'd like to join me, no big deal. All right? And if not, \nthat's cool too. Ok?\n\nHe starts to walk away.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Uh, when you say \"next door\", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Flingers.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n[Scene Initech. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom.]\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>So what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and \nyou bring them down to the software engineers?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>That, that's right.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Well, then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the \nspecifications directly to the software people, huh?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with \ncustomers.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>You physically take the specs from the customer?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Ah.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Then you must physically bring them to the software people.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Well, what would you say\u0085 you do here?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so \nthe engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at \ndealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!?

What's your favorite song of his?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Hmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.\n\nThe Bobs laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>HA HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean, \nhaving the same name as him. I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue. \nBut anyway, let's get down to business, Michael!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>You, you know, you can just call me Mike.\n\nThey stare at him.\n\n[Scene Flingers.

Would you like to sit down?\n\nHe motions to a chair.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. (does so) Wow. This place is really nice.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, is it?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Oh my God, compared to Chotchkie's.

(laughs\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's on your - (points\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Oh! That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What are pieces of flair?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff. \nWe're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair. \nquite stupid actually.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Do you get to pick them out yourself?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just \ngrabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say! \nY'know, I don't really care.

So I go through these thousands of lines of code \nand uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't \nthink I'm gonna go anymore.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>You're just not gonna go?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Won't you get fired?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't know.

I'll see you in a few. (they walk off) \nHey, Milton, what's happening?\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>Uh...sir...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could \nget it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be \ngreat.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No, no, because I was, I was -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put \nin here.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...sir...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No. No.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Let me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get \nto that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch, \nMilton. Bye.\n\nHe walks off.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>Ok. I'll set the building on fire.\n\n[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks \nup to him.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Peter!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Michael!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here \nand start shooting.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a \nnumber I don't wanna lose.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on \nSaturday. What were you doing?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything \nthat I thought it could be.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, \nyou're supposed to be having your interview right now with the \nconsultants.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Who?\n\nHe writes down Joanna's number.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What has gotten into you?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh yeah. Right.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make \nsomething up.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ah, no way. I feel great.\n\n[Scene The interview room.]\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.\n\nPeter enters.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter \nGibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate, \nBob Porter.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Hi, Bob. Bob.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?\n\nHe does so.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Y'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel \nfor how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk \nus through a typical day for you?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Great.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side \ndoor, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta \nspace out for about an hour.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Space out?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that \nfor probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a \ngiven week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a \nlittle more?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Let me tell you something about TPS reports...'\n\nCut to later. Peter is more relaxed.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't \ncare.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Don't, don't care?\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and \nInitech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's \nthe motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different \nbosses right now!\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>I beg your pardon?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Eight bosses.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Eight?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different \npeople coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is \nnot to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, \nit will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Bear with me for a minute.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Believe me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some \nkind of stock option and equity sharing program?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice \ntalking to be of you guys.\n\nHe shakes their hands.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Absolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Good luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Wow.\n\nCut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -\n\nPeter walks right past him.\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's]\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>I need to talk about your flair.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare \nminimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a \nterrific smile.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more?\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Look. Joanna.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's \nfor the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. \nIt's about fun.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. So, more then?\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare \nminimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we \nencourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Yeah.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Great. Great. That's all I ask.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Right. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom \nSmykowski.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>He's useless.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Gone.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Sounds good to me.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Here's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Who's he?\n\n<b>BOB\n</b>You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Oh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>We can't find a record of him being a current employee here.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>I looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed \noff about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through \na glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed \nthe glitch.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Great.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>So, um, Milton has been let go.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Just a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he \nwon't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out \nnaturally.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is \nsolved from here on, then.\n\nThey laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Uh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this \nyoung man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all \nover him.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Ooh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with \nyou there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that \nhe's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having \nsome problems with his TPS reports.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>I'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Um-um.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really \nmotivated.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>There it is.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Yeah, I'm not sure about that now.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>All right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you \nsay you deal with these TPS reports?\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Yeah...\n\n[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He \ntakes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]\n\nCut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.\n\nCut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.\n\nCut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to \npull off the bumper.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not \nthere.\n\nCut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a \nbig fish.\n\nCut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Hello, Peter.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Hey Dom!\n\nHe slaps him on the back.\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut \nit. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.\n\nCut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it \nover. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.\n\n[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as \nBill walks up.]\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have \nthose TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh, \nyeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, \nhmm?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to \nhave to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a \nmeeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, they called me at home.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all \nfixed up for you later.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b><b>F...C...P...\n</b>\n<b>BILL\n</b>Hi, Milton. What's going on?\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I, I did and they, and they said -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...I...I...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can \nget.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>And if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care \nof the roach problem we've been having that would be great. (He walks \naway.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?\n\n[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs.]\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>It looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.\n\nThey laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>That's terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some \nof the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a \nlittle (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Well, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Naga...\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Naga-worker here anyway!\n\nThe Bobs laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Mr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in \nSingapore, that's the usual deal.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Well, it's standard operating procedure.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Do they know about this yet?\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a \nFriday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an \nincident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we \nwould like to do is put you into a position where you would have as \nmany as four people working right underneath you.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>This is a big promotion, Pete.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Huge.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Umm-hmm.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Wow!\n\n[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. \nCome on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. \nLet's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-\n\nPeter walks up to him.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight?\n\n[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is \nnow, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're \nthe one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious \nexperience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or \nyou're gonna get canned.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one \nthat, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah? What about it?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, how does it work?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank \ntransaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in \nfractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it \ntakes those remainders and puts it into your account.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>This sounds familiar.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah. They did this in Superman III.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. What a good movie.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, so they check for this now?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're \nupdating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all \nthat code.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's numbers up their asses.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What if you didn't have a good job?\n\n[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Cockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you, \nyou haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Actually, I'm being promoted.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What?!!!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something \ntoday. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all \nof us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the \nother day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I \nsaw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't \nhave a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this \nway. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at \ncomputer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to \neight different bosses drone on about mission statements.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass \noff at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing \nor something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go \nin tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know \nwhy? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael, \nlet's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place \nthat we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software \nworks right?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Of course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work, \nI don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software \nloan.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah? But Samir does.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>But that's not much money, I -\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent. \nThat's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it \nout over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Just like Superman III.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to \nget my resume ready.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for \nno reason?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>That's right! If I'm lucky.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed \naround. Aren't you?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't \nRiyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they \ncan do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum \nsecurity resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have \nconjugal visits there?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Really.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yes.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>So what do you think?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock \nof that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two \noptions\n\nunemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>I have a question.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yes.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yep.

I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over. \nDon't worry! You're worrying! All right? Monday morning we're gonna \ncheck the account balance and everything will be all right. Don't miss \nTom's barbecue. I'll see you there.\n\nPeter goes inside.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b><b>RAPPING) BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...\n</b>\n[Scene Peter's place, morning.

I really can't.\n\n[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.]\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>So when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these \nextra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify \nthe whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into \nan account that we own.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>So you're stealing.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ah, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh, \nit's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, \nover time, they add up to a lot.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. That's not yours?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, it, it becomes ours.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>How's that not stealing?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well.

I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it \nfrom a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong \nwith that?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>It seems wrong.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all \nright? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get \nup in the morning and put on pieces of flair?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the \nregister!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear \nthem.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>What?!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Look, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go \nto the barbecue, all right?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n[Scene Tom's house.

Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want \nme to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over \nthere, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of \nflair?\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I \ndon't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the \nfinger) All right? There's my flair!

Ok!\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Ok?!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Ok! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place \nor something. Shit. I always do that.

This was all your idea, \nasshole.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>All right. Ok. All right. Let's try not to get pissed off at each \nother, all right? We'll figure this thing out together, ok? And the \nfirst thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it \ngets any bigger.\n\n[Scene Initech. It's Bill's 41st birthday.

We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing? \nI, I think they'd figure that out.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Well, we have to do something.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>May-maybe we launder the money.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's \nsomething I think, I think coke dealers do.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok.
