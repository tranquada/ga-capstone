Artist's canvases\n          propped   up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples\n          talking   intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people\n          smoking   and drinking.\n          \n          A man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner...\n          \n          FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a\n          patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls.

They move well, in sync,\n          looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the\n          silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her\n          back.\n          \n          Close on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they\n          lose themselves in each other...\n          \n                                                         SMASH CUT TO:\n          \n          \n          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT.\n          \n          Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and\n          tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we\n          hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play...\n          \n          Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls.   Nothing.   Then\n          vigorous, relieved applause.\n          \n          Frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:\n          \n                              WOMAN\n                    Thank God that's over...\n          \n          April takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank\n          applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining\n          him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause.\n          \n          Then Frank hears the voice again:\n          \n                              WOMAN (CONT'D)\n                    ...And she was very disappointing.\n          \n          He can't argue.\n          \n          \n          INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER.\n          \n          Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members\n          towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye-\n          contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve.\n          \n                                                                      3.\n          \n          \n          MR.

You have a very\n                    talented wife.\n          \n          Frank forces a smile as he goes.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    I'll pass it along!\n          \n          \n          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.\n          \n          April sits alone at her dressing table crying.\n          \n          \n          INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT.\n          \n          The CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have\n          decided to make light of the disaster.\n          \n          Frank moves through the crowd.    Across the room, he sees -\n          \n          MILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip-\n          toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in\n          costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat.\n          \n                              MILLY\n                    Frank!\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Hi!\n          \n                              MILLY\n                    She's through there...!\n                        (points)\n                    You `bout ready for that drink?\n          \n                                                                      4.\n          \n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Couple of minutes!\n          \n          \n          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.\n          \n          Frank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A\n          cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing\n          screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the\n          top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say.\n          \n                               FRANK\n                        (heartfelt)\n                    April, sweetheart.   You were great.\n                    I mean it.\n          \n          The door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street\n          clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room.\n          \n                              APRIL\n                    Hi. You about ready to leave?\n                    I've just got to get this makeup\n                    off, then we can go.\n          \n          She sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at\n          him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He\n          puts his hand on her shoulder.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph\n                    or anything, was it?\n          \n          APRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a\n          second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly\n          the wrong thing.\n          \n                              APRIL\n                    I guess not. I'll be ready in a\n                    minute.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Take your time.\n          \n          He removes his hands and lights a cigarette.     APRIL begins to\n          take off her makeup.\n          \n                                                                        5.\n          \n          \n                              APRIL\n                    Will you do me a favor? Milly and\n                    Shep wanted us to go out with them\n                    afterwards. Will you say we can't?\n                    Say it's because of the baby sitter\n                    or something?\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Well, the thing is, I already said\n                    that we could. I mean, I just saw\n                    them out there and I said we would.\n          \n                              APRIL\n                        (tense)\n                    Oh. Then would you mind going out\n                    again and saying you were mistaken?\n                    That should be simple enough.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    Don't you think that's a little bit\n                    rude, April?\n          \n                              APRIL\n                    Well I'll tell them myself.\n          \n                               FRANK\n                    Okay.

HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT.\n          \n          April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past\n          school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.\n          \n          They don't touch.   They don't speak.   The tension between\n          them is palpable.\n          \n          \n          INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.\n          \n          Frank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit by\n          the dashboard. After a while...\n          \n                                                               6.\n          \n          \n                              FRANK\n                    I mean it, baby.

Number\n                    three, I don't happen to fit the\n                    role of dumb, insensitive suburban\n                    husband; you've been trying to hang\n                    that one on me ever since we moved\n                    here.

I don't need everything\n                    we have here. I don't care where\n                    we live! I mean who made these\n                    rules, anyway? The only reason we\n                    moved out here was because I got\n                    pregnant. Then we had another\n                    child to prove the first one wasn't\n                    a mistake.

Tell me the\n                    truth, Frank. Remember that? We\n                    used to live by it. You know what's\n                    so good about the truth? Everyone\n                    knows what it is, however long\n                    they've lived without it. No one\n                    forgets the truth, Frank, they just\n                    get better at lying. So tell me: do\n                    you really want another child?\n          \n          Frank turns towards her.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    All I know is what I feel.

You make it sound\n                    like having children is a\n                    punishment.\n          \n                              APRIL\n                    I love my children.\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    And you're sure about that?\n          \n                              APRIL\n                    What the hell is that supposed to\n                    mean?\n          \n                              FRANK\n                    April, you just said our daughter\n                    was mistake.

Shep looks around...\n          \n          Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number\n          of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by\n          two Doctors.\n          \n          Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's\n          in shock.\n          \n                                FRANK\n                    No.   No.   No.\n          \n          They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his\n          feet, the chair skidding behind him.\n          \n                              DOCTOR\n                    Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.\n          \n                              SHEP\n                    Sit down Frank.\n          \n          Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.\n          \n          \n          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR.\n          \n          A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The\n          crisp green lawns.

CITY PARK - DAY.\n          \n          The same silence over a beautiful day in the city.    And\n          from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy\n          branches of trees.\n          \n          Two children play in a playground in a small park.\n          \n          It's Jennifer and Michael.

GIVINGS' LIVING ROOM - DAY\n          \n          Mrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish\n          onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper.\n          \n          A new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby.\n          \n                              MRS. GIVINGS\n                    I can't tell you how pleased I am\n                    about the little Revolutionary Road\n                    place, Howard. Remember how dreary\n                    it looked all winter? All cold and\n                    dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-\n                    crawly. And now whenever I drive\n                    past, it gives me such a lift to\n                    see it all perked up and spanking\n                    clean again, with lights in the\n                    windows. And do you know, I was\n                    just thinking, I've loved that\n                    little house for years, and the\n                    Braces are the first really\n                    suitable people I've ever found for\n                    it. Really nice, congenial people,\n                    I mean.\n          \n          Mr. Givings fiddles with his hearing aid.\n          \n                              MR.

GIVINGS\n                    Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers\n                    but they always were a bit -- a bit\n                    whimsical, for my taste. A bit\n                    neurotic. I may not have stressed\n                    it, but they were often very trying\n                    people to deal with, in many ways.\n                              (MORE)\n          \n                                                                 104.\n          \n                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)\n                    Actually, the main reason the\n                    little house has been so hard to\n                    sell is that they let it depreciate\n                    so dreadfully. Warped window\n                    frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on\n                    the walls, filthy smudges around\n                    all the--\n          \n          Mr. Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY... SILENCE...\n          but for the faint sound of wind.\n          \n          He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs. Givings continues\n          to talk, but we can't hear a thing.\n          \n          He has turned off his hearing aid.\n          \n                                                     FADE TO BLACK\n          \n          \n \n\n\n\n\nRevolutionary Road\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Justin Haythe\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:51.844571"}
