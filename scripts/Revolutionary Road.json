Remember how dreary\n                    it looked all winter? All cold and\n                    dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-\n                    crawly. And now whenever I drive\n                    past, it gives me such a lift to\n                    see it all perked up and spanking\n                    clean again, with lights in the\n                    windows. And do you know, I was\n                    just thinking, I've loved that\n                    little house for years, and the\n                    Braces are the first really\n                    suitable people I've ever found for\n                    it.

A bit\n                    neurotic. I may not have stressed\n                    it, but they were often very trying\n                    people to deal with, in many ways.\n<b>                              (MORE)\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                                                                 104.\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                              MRS.
