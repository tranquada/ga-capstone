Kresimir elaborately opens the door for \n               Benda, his new wife, and they walk with hands intertwined up \n               the steps of the West Tower.\n\n<b>               INT.

The doorman, like most security guards, does \n               not look capable of handling a serious crisis. He is about \n               fifty, of average height but slightly built, wears thick \n               glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his \n               hip.\n\n<b>                                     DOORMAN\n</b>                         Morning, folks.

ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING\n</b>\n               Dr. Emil Hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling \n               Annabelle Horsefield. Despite the difference in their sizes -- \n               Annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen -- Hobbes is \n               not having an easy time of it. Hobbes is wearing overlarge \n               blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; Annabelle is in a private \n               girls' school outfit -- white blouse, dark blue tie, blue \n               knee socks, pleated gray skirt.\n\n               Annabelle fights back fiercely; Hobbes has tears in his eyes. \n               The struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, \n               although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their \n               way to cause a lot of crashing around. At one point Annabelle \n               breaks loose and Hobbes has to chase her.\n\n               Annabelle slips and Hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, \n               where he has the advantage of leverage. He strangles her \n               quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. Blood oozes from \n               her mouth. Hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though \n               trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something \n               from leaving her body.\n\n               He reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled \n               some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, \n               and clamps Annabelle's lips together. He then picks up her \n               body, carries it over to the dining-room table and sweeps \n               the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. He then \n               places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins \n               to undress it.\n\n<b>               INT. LOBBY -- MORNING\n</b>\n               The doorman leaves the Svibens to open the door for the \n               Spergazzis, an elderly Italian couple who both use aluminum, \n               four-pronged canes to help them walk. The Svibens watch the \n               old couple as they enter and then glance at each other \n               significantly -- 'We'll be together when we're as old as \n               they are.'\n\n               Mr. Spergazzi tips his hat to the doorman, who opens the \n               inner door for him.\n\n               As the Spergazzis make their way shakily toward the elevators, \n               Mr. Merrick, the rental agent, appears from around a corner. \n               He is slick, mustachioed, and wears a wide paisley tie. He \n               extends his hand for a handshake even though he is still \n               fifty feet from the inner doors. The doorman keeps the door \n               open for him.\n\n<b>                                     DOORMAN\n</b>                         Here's Mr. Merrick.

ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING\n</b>\n               Hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose, \n               snaps on rubber gloves.\n\n               He turns to Annabelle's corpse on the dining-room table, \n               legs hanging over the edge, now naked -- the private girls' \n               school clothes in a heap on the floor. Hobbes takes a scalpel \n               from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his \n               surgical instruments. He feels Annabelle's stomach until he \n               has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, \n               confident stroke of the scalpel.\n\n               He then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some \n               clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and \n               drops it into her abdominal cavity. The corpse bursts into \n               flame.\n\n               Hobbes steps back to watch. Tears spring into his eyes. He \n               picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into \n               his neck. Blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to \n               the other side. Hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing \n               corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons \n               of his neck.\n\n<b>               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- MORNING\n</b>\n               Merrick and the Svibens sit across from each other at a long \n               table strewn with floor plans and maps. The river which \n               surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass walls of \n               the office. Merrick taps one plan with his finger and slides \n               it over to Benda.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Now you take a look at that one, \n                         Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't \n                         suit you down to the ground.

TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- MORNING\n</b>\n               In his bathroom, Nicholas Tudor is cleaning his teeth with \n               microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed-\n               water device called a water-pick. Tudor is thirty-nine, not \n               happy with his work as an insurance appraiser, and has \n               recently adopted a general air of terse, sullen desperation \n               as his primary mood.\n\n               His wife, Janine, calls to him from the kitchen, where she \n               is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast.\n\n<b>                                     JANINE (V.O.)\n</b>                         Breakfast is just about ready, Nick.\n\n               Tudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water-\n               pick until he is completely satisfied. He carefully packs \n               the machine away, then leaves the bathroom.\n\n               In the dining room, Janine is putting breakfast on the table. \n               Tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. Janine \n               returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee \n               in each hand. She puts one cup in front of Tudor, sits down, \n               starts to drink the other one.

Rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to \n               reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and \n               accessories.\n\n               Rollo offers some to St. Luc while stuffing one in his own \n               mouth. There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus \n               mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. Rollo \n               and St. Luc sit around Rollo's desk, a very sleek metal \n               affair.\n\n               Rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and \n               biology room in a museum of natural history. Specimens of \n               all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, \n               floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. There are \n               also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab \n               cultures in various stages of neglect.\n\n               There are also clippings from magazines and newspapers \n               sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which \n               are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves.\n\n               Despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an \n               underlying order which reflects Rollo's own real discipline, \n               which is not always immediately apparent. And the microscopes \n               and glass slides, the stainless-steel gynecological table \n               complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, \n               etc., are spotless and in good shape.\n\n               Rollo is rotund, soft-faced, and a manic-depressive. In his \n               manic phase he is a joker and an elbow-nudger, and his general \n               style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, \n               is broad North-American Jewish. In his depressive phase, he \n               becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his \n               character.\n\n               Rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment \n               on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes \n                         would have laid on you, Rog, but \n                         it's all I got, and...\n                              (places hand on heart, \n                              leans over \n                              confidentially)\n                         ...all I got I share with you.

Tudor tries \n               to cover up, grabs the water-pick, and begins to work on his \n               teeth again, hiding the occasional twinge that hits him.\n\n<b>                                     JANINE\n</b>                         You say something?\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                         Nope.

WOMEN'S SAUNA -- AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               Janine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head \n               and middle. Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early \n               forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her \n               hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with \n               Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. \n               She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created \n               her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to \n               the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior \n               and has never known independence.\n\n               They are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, \n               Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. \n               She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly \n               thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other \n               two full-bodied women.\n\n               Betts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's \n               disease.\n\n<b>                                     BETTS\n</b>                         ...probably nothing at all.

Something bothers him.\n\n               The door to one of the examination rooms opens and Forsythe \n               pops her head around the corner.\n\n<b>                                     FORSYTHE\n</b>                         Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, \n                         Doctor.\n\n<b>                                     ST.

TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               Tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attach\u00e9 \n               case on to a chair. He loosens his tie and makes himself a \n               drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the TV \n               set.\n\n               After only a short moment of relative calm, Tudor suddenly \n               contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to \n               the floor. He rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his \n               head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of \n               water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension.\n\n               He soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm \n               of pain apparently over. He keeps both hands clamped over \n               his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of \n               vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom.\n\n               Once in the bathroom, Tudor throws himself over the side of \n               the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the \n               tub itself.\n\n               He gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on \n               the floor, mouth bloody. In the tub, a trail of blood-streaked \n               slime leads into the drain.\n\n<b>               INT.

TUDOR'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Tudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom, wiping \n               his mouth with a facecloth. He sits down on a chair facing \n               the sliding glass door which leads to the apartment's balcony.\n\n               He breathes heavily, gasping for air. His expression is a \n               dazed one and he mumbles incoherently. After a moment's rest \n               he rises, opens the glass door, and steps out on to the \n               balcony.\n\n<b>               EXT.

They both hold \n               small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly \n               along the path bordering the lawn.\n\n               Suddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited \n               by Tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is \n               heard. A large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's \n               umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a \n               heavy, blood-soaked sponge. The force of the blow almost \n               twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and \n               she gives a little cry of surprise.\n\n               Her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her \n               balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she \n               sees the blood.\n\n               The first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not \n               react with such surprise.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST LADY\n</b>                              (examining the bloodied \n                              umbrella)\n                         Aw.

We can barely make out its \n               bloody, twitching form.\n\n               Beyond the parasite is a basement window through which is \n               visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers. \n               The window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar \n               of laundry soap.\n\n               The first lady makes a move to find the injured creature, \n               but her companion tightens her grip on the old lady's arm.\n\n<b>                                     COMPANION\n</b>                         Come along, Olive.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST LADY\n</b>                         Oh, Vi!

The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only \n               by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of \n               wall immediately below the window.\n\n               The hand of an old woman, puckered and wrinkled from many \n               hours submerged in hot soapy water, reaches up, and yanks \n               the bar of soap out of the jaws of the window. The window \n               swing shut. The woman's hand slides the bolt home, locking \n               the window from the inside.\n\n               The old woman is short, dumpy, puffy-faced, in her late \n               sixties. Her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her \n               head.\n\n               She sniffles, shakes her head, turns away from the window, \n               and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and \n               dryers. As she walks she has to thread her way among the \n               dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry -- against \n               apartment regulations, she takes in outsiders' laundry -- \n               which she has brought down the elevator with her.\n\n               She flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig \n               clothes out of the nearest shopping bag.\n\n               From above and behind the washer, we watch her fill the \n               machine and reach into the front of her dress, which is black \n               and frayed. After feeling around for a few seconds, she pulls \n               out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent. \n               She dumps some of this into the washer, finds the appropriate \n               coins in the pocket of her dress, and starts the machine.\n\n               She watches it for a second to make sure it's working \n               properly, then puts the plastic bag back where she found it. \n               She picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in \n               her ragged slippers to the next washer. She stops in front \n               of it and puts down the bag.\n\n               The old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of \n               the washer. She grimaces, grabs a sock from the bag and cleans \n               off the top of the washer with it. She tosses the sock into \n               the washer and leans over the hole, trying to see inside.\n\n               The parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly \n               springs from the opening on to the old woman's face, suckering \n               on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles. She shrieks and \n               grabs at the creature with both hands, trying to pull it \n               off.\n\n               She stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over \n               various shopping bags. Finally she goes down amidst her \n               laundry, thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere.\n\n<b>               INT.

She \n               takes it and advances to Tudor's box, jug swinging, companion \n               trailing after her in admiration. She stops at Tudor's milk \n               box and flicks the door open.\n\n               She looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles \n               back in the shadows. Ugh! What's that?\n\n               The boy takes a look. Inside the box a third parasite can \n               just be seen clinging to a three-quart white plastic milk \n               jug. The jug is smeared with blood. The box's inside door is \n               ajar. The TV set can be heard from inside the apartment.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         I dunno.

It is Tudor's abdomen, and he \n               reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size \n               of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel.\n\n               Tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. He \n               gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears \n               the instant it's touched.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                              (delirious, voice \n                              strained, whispering)\n                         Come here, boy. Here, boy, here.\n\n               He taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though \n               trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers.\n\n               He is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half-dressed. \n               He looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with \n               maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                         Come on, fella.

Gently, Tudor begins stroking it. \n               The lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly, the rhythm \n               strangely masturbatory.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                              (soothingly)\n                         Attaboy.\n                              (closing his eyes in \n                              bliss and smiling \n                              again)\n                         Attaboy.\n\n               In the living room, Janine suddenly realizes that if the TV \n               set was on, Nick must be home.\n\n               She gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom.\n\n               Inside the bedroom, we see the door open.

He walks down the hallway looking for Betts's apartment. \n               After he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is \n               slightly ajar.\n\n               As Kurt approaches, the door opens wider to reveal the old \n               woman from the laundry room. She is no longer wearing her \n               dumpy laundry clothes, however, but is dressed in a \n               translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of make-\n               up. She is careful to keep half her face hidden behind the \n               door.\n\n               Kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her. He is just \n               approaching her when she calls to him.\n\n<b>                                     OLD WOMAN\n</b>                         I'm hungry!\n\n               Kurt keeps on moving. He is now just passing her door. The \n               old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more.\n\n<b>                                     OLD WOMAN\n</b>                         I'm hungry!\n\n               Kurt can't resist turning to look at her, although he keeps \n               moving. When he looks her in the eye, she eases out slightly \n               from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been \n               horribly burned by the laundry-room parasite, the eye melted \n               shut, the nostril drooping.\n\n               Kurt is so stunned that he slows. The old woman speaks softly.\n\n<b>                                     OLD WOMAN\n</b>                         Hungry for love. Hungry for love.\n\n               She suddenly reaches out and grabs Kurt by his tux with both \n               hands and, with tremendous energy, jerks him back into her \n               apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious kick.\n\n               Kurt's cart remains out in the hallway, the food steaming.\n\n<b>               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               In her dining room, Betts mixes herself a drink and checks \n               her watch. She takes a sip, then goes into the bathroom and \n               bends over the bathtub, having balanced her drink on the \n               edge of the tub.\n\n               From inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the plug \n               in the plughole.\n\n               Betts turns on the water, adjusting the proportion of hot to \n               cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it, then \n               gets undressed.\n\n               She wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out \n               to the living room with her drink in hand. In the living \n               room, she arranges her photos in a new order, props them up \n               against the sofa, changes them around again.\n\n               Back in the bathroom, Betts checks the temperature of the \n               water by swishing her hand around in it. The water drums \n               heavily on the floor of the tub. Betts puts her drink on the \n               edge of the tub and turns the water off.\n\n               She now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the \n               tub. She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her \n               sandals on the bathmat, then picks up her drink and stretches \n               back. She takes a big slug of her drink. Her toes curl in \n               pleasure.\n\n               The drain plug begins to jerk and twitch, as though something \n               were trying to push it out from inside the drain.\n\n               Betts sinks down in the water until her hair, short as it \n               is, begins to float a bit.\n\n               The drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until \n               it is pushed right out of its plug hole. The water begins to \n               run out of the drain, but only in a slight trickle -- the \n               drain pipe is blocked by a soft, spongy body.\n\n               Betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the \n               tub, smiling, relaxed, enjoying the sensation.\n\n               One of the parasite's stubby tentacles slowly appears, probing \n               out of the drain hole. Then another appears, then another.\n\n               Betts puts down her drink on the tub's edge and reaches for \n               the soap and washcloth. Her eyes are half-closed and a smile \n               still flickers about her lips. The sound of water suddenly \n               rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her \n               reverie.\n\n               She sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub. \n               The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the \n               tub, almost touching her legs, which are pressed together \n               against one side of the tub. The water is becoming pink with \n               the blood that diffuses through it.\n\n               Betts' mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide. Her reactions \n               are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently \n               had.\n\n               Under the water, now very shallow, the parasite's tentacles \n               touch Betts's thighs.\n\n               Betts tries to scream but can't. The parasite suckers its \n               way between Betts' thighs. She screams a silent scream in \n               the tub, her mouth wide open, her head rolling from side to \n               side. The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the \n               water and the gurgle of the drain.\n\n               With a spasm that shakes her whole body, Betts throws her \n               arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and \n               on to the tiles of the bathroom floor. The glass shatters. \n               After a moment or two of further silent struggle, Betts arches \n               her back, then falls into a semi-conscious stupor, slumping \n               motionless in the tub.\n\n<b>               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Nicholas Tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of the \n               covers. The physical state of his face, ghastly and \n               cadaverous, is in sharp contrast to his expression, which is \n               ecstatic, beatific, Madonna-like.\n\n               Tudor's hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often \n               associated with pregnant women. Between his hands, in the \n               area around the navel, three lumps shift beneath the skin, \n               changing positions and pulsing rhythmically.\n\n               As they move, Tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds, \n               a parody of a lullaby.\n\n               In the living room, Janine sits on the couch agitatedly \n               flipping through her Vogue, now wearing large, fashionable \n               glasses with thick, tinted prescription lenses. She can't \n               seem to get into doing anything until St. Luc comes.\n\n               She gets up and turns the TV on again, deliberately turning \n               up the volume to an uncomfortable level.\n\n<b>               INT.

You \n                         have to put a lock on everything.\n\n               She puts the jug back in the milk chute. She notices the \n               blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite in the \n               chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers.\n\n               She stares at her wrist in astonishment. She is wearing the \n               parasite like some monstrous, spongy, oozing wristwatch. She \n               tries to shake the thing off. It can't be dislodged. She \n               turns in disbelief to her husband and then screams at the \n               top of her lungs.\n\n               Mr. Spergazzi lifts his cane and tries to strike the thing \n               with the cane's prongs. The force of his blow throws him off \n               balance and he falls, dragging his wife down with him.\n\n               Mrs. Spergazzi moans in pain and terror. Her husband manages \n               to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing with \n               his cane. White burning fluid begins to squirt everywhere. \n               Mrs Spergazzi's forearm begins to smoke, bubble, and dissolve. \n               She becomes hysterical.\n\n               Mr. Spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing, now with \n               some success.\n\n<b>               INT. FORSYTHE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               In the kitchen, a thick paperbound book called Guide to \n               Gourmet Cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen counter \n               next to the sink. There are a couple of pots and pans heating \n               on the stove.\n\n               Forsythe picks up the book, then opens one of the pots to \n               check something. She is obviously taking a lot of care with \n               St. Luc's late supper. She puts the lid back on the pot, \n               reads a bit more, then checks the time on an electric clock \n               on the counter.\n\n               She opens the oven door, then takes a bone-handled carving \n               fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a \n               ceramic roasting dish.\n\n               Someone knocks on the door. Forsythe leaves her oven and \n               goes to answer it, carving fork in hand.\n\n               She opens the door. Kresimir Sviben stands in the hallway, \n               eyes wide, insane smile on his face. He looks at Forsythe as \n               though she were a piece of steak.\n\n<b>                                     FORSYTHE\n</b>                         Yes?\n\n               Kresimir doesn't answer. He begins to drool, his mouth working \n               as though in anticipation of a meal.

Kresimir throws himself at her legs, \n               managing to grab one of her feet. She doesn't fall, but holds \n               on to a cabinet and tries to pull free.\n\n               Kresimir begins to climb up her body. Forsythe, terrified \n               and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of \n               the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder.

A hand \n               holding a cr\u00eape oozing red jam and sugar reaches around into \n               the elevator.\n\n               The two women cringe, suddenly afraid. Kurt, the delivery \n               boy, steps around and into the elevator, smiling broadly, \n               eyes wide and glistening. He drools slightly. The doors slide \n               closed.

Then, checking to make sure which elevator is the \n               stuck one, he plays with a switch which manually overrides \n               the floor selector and brings the elevator down.\n\n               The doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is \n               finally coming down. He stands by, waiting to see who or \n               what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so \n               long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and \n               authoritarian.\n\n               The doors spring open. Kurt stands at the back of the \n               elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. \n               The girl is finishing the last bit of one of the cr\u00eapes, \n               sucking her fingers deliciously.\n\n               The mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat \n               open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. She struggles to \n               her feet. Kurt and the girl are ignoring her.\n\n               The doorman is nonplussed.

Distractedly, she goes through the motions of \n               putting her contact lenses in: opens the medicine-cabinet \n               door, takes out the lens container, takes out the bottles of \n               wetting and soaking solutions, opens the lens container. \n               Suddenly, Tudor wails terribly, like a hound, from the \n               bedroom.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                              (heart-rending wail)\n                         Ooooooooooooooooo!\n\n               Janine turns to the door, turns back to the lenses, dumps \n               both lenses out into her hand, begins to squirt solution on \n               them. She has decided to try to ignore Tudor.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                              (wailing)\n                         Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!\n\n               Janine can no longer pretend that she doesn't hear him. \n               Closing her hand around the two lenses, she runs out of the \n               bathroom.\n\n               Tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness. His lips \n               move silently, spasmically, as though in sleep, twitching in \n               an abnormal, insect fashion. There is a swelling in his \n               throat, almost as though he has developed a goiter, which \n               swells and contracts rhythmically.\n\n               Janine appears in the doorway.\n\n<b>                                     JANINE\n</b>                              (a strangled half-\n                              whisper)\n                         I'm here, Nick. Janine is here.\n\n               After a pause, she walks into the room.\n\n               She climbs on to the bed and settles down. She puts her face \n               very close to Tudor's. For the moment, his face is \n               expressionless, but his neck is swollen just under the jaw.\n\n               Janine sighs deeply, trying not to panic. Her eyes narrow \n               suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is \n               myopic -- as she notices something odd.\n\n               There is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corner \n               of Tudor's mouth. Janine moves closer to it. The black thing, \n               like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches.\n\n               Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudor's lip. As \n               her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside Tudor's \n               mouth.\n\n               Janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists, \n               cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever \n               occupies Tudor's mouth.\n\n               Gradually the thread reappears. Tudor's lips part slightly \n               to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which \n               the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- is \n               attached. The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way \n               from between Tudor's lips.\n\n               Janine is paralyzed with horror.\n\n               The tentacle is now touching Tudor's chin, his cheek, the \n               tip of his nose.\n\n               Janine's fists tighten even more. A glassy snap breaks the \n               silence. Janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. In \n               the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are \n               incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the \n               lenses into her flesh until they snapped. The segmented lens \n               fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood.\n\n               She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. She \n               eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first \n               stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. She moves \n               a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the \n               movement of the tentacles.\n\n               The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudor's chin and \n               cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to \n               draw itself out of his body. His throat bulges, his cheeks \n               swell as the tentacles contract. His lips are gradually forced \n               apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. His mouth is \n               opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly exposes \n               itself to the dim light of the bedroom.\n\n               Janine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling \n               cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes through \n               the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, \n               whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the \n               doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Janine runs down a hallway that leads to Betts's apartment, \n               sobbing and stumbling. She gets to Betts's door and opens it \n               without hesitation.\n\n<b>               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Janine enters Betts' apartment.

It's me.\n\n               She catches sight of Betts standing out on the balcony, \n               looking across at the North Tower's lights. Betts turns \n               slowly. She is wearing immaculate but very extreme make-up. \n               Janine is slightly taken aback -- it's not Betts' style.\n\n               Betts smiles and opens her arms to Janine.\n\n<b>               INT.

His car is large and American and ostentatious, a \n               gold Cadillac Eldorado with options or equivalent.\n\n               The car pulls out of the lot and on to the street.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The doorman, drooling and twitching, locks the exit doors at \n               the end of one hallway. In one hand he holds an enormous \n               pair of cable cutters.\n\n<b>               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               St. Luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with \n               the poker. Finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered \n               corpse of Spergazzi's parasite.\n\n               Deftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, St. Luc \n               manages to pull the parasite out into the light. Garbage \n               comes rattling down the chute. When St. Luc flashes his light \n               into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of Betts' \n               French food, half-eaten, silver servers and all, the snails \n               being especially prominent. Insane giggles echo down the \n               chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere \n               several floors above.\n\n               St. Luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the \n               incinerator. The light seems to go right through the parasite, \n               illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, \n               etc.\n\n               As St. Luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on \n               the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens \n               behind him. A large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and \n               approaches the oblivious St. Luc.\n\n               The man slips his arms up under St. Luc's arms and kisses \n               him passionately on the neck. As soon as St. Luc realizes \n               what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his \n               elbow and pulls free.\n\n               The man grabs St. Luc again, trying to kiss him on the mouth. \n               They struggle. St. Luc is thrown to the concrete floor. The \n               man tries to pin him down. St. Luc, on the verge of being \n               overpowered, smashes the man in the chest with the poker, \n               parasite still hooked into its tip.\n\n               The man stands up unsteadily. St. Luc cracks him on the ankle \n               with the poker and he comes crashing down. The parasite corpse \n               is flung across the room, where it smacks wetly into the \n               wall and slides to the floor.\n\n               St. Luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the \n               head. After a furious moment or two, he suddenly stops, drops \n               the poker, and stares at the body in horrified disbelief.\n\n               St. Luc slowly backs away from the man's body, which is very \n               still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor. \n               He bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man. The \n               collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat, and \n               he turns, himself scratched and bleeding, and staggers up \n               the basement steps.\n\n<b>               INT. SPERGAZZI'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Forsythe waits impatiently for St. Luc. Mr. Spergazzi is \n               watching a variety show on TV and Mrs. Spergazzi is making \n               ravioli in the kitchen, more or less recovered from her \n               encounter with the parasite.\n\n               Suddenly a piercing scream is heard from down the hall. Mr. \n               Spergazzi, hard of hearing, doesn't notice. The scream is \n               followed by bangs, crashes, and insane laughter and giggling.\n\n               Mrs. Spergazzi comes out of the kitchen. She has heard the \n               noises. She and Forsythe look at each other for a moment, \n               then Forsythe goes to the door and slides the chain lock \n               into place. She then goes to the telephone to call the police.\n\n<b>                                     FORSYTHE\n</b>                              (into receiver)\n                         Hello?

Mrs. Spergazzi knows that something is very wrong. \n               She wrings her hands and begins to wail in Italian.\n\n<b>               INT.

The residents, \n               some of them women, giggle in anticipation. Once the door \n               has been opened, they all rush in, drooling and moaning.\n\n               From inside the apartment we hear several muffled voices, at \n               first angry and indignant, then pleading and terrified. \n               Screams and crashes follow.\n\n<b>               INT.

But each time he pushes her down, she pops up \n               and begins wailing and moaning again.\n\n               Forsythe paces back and forth, checks her watch, paces some \n               more. Finally, after a particularly noisy outburst by Mrs. \n               Spergazzi, Forsythe picks up the doctor's bag, unchains the \n               door, and leaves.\n\n               Spergazzi hears the door slam and looks up.\n\n<b>                                     MR.

Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. \n               She tugs on the handle and it opens.\n\n<b>               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               St. Luc has made his way to the main doors and stands talking \n               to the rental agent, Merrick, who is leaning against the \n               intercom board with the doorman's pocketbook romance in one \n               hand.\n\n               The agent looks perfectly normal, though he keeps wiping his \n               mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         ...haven't seen anything that looks \n                         like trouble at all. Just filling in \n                         for Walter... the doorman. But if \n                         you want me to call the police, I \n                         will.\n\n               St. Luc is cautious but he seems to believe Merrick. He \n               presses the button which buzzes the Spergazzi apartment. \n               Nobody answers. A middle-aged man walks in. Worried, St. Luc \n               buzzes again.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.\n\n               Merrick smiles and opens the door for the man, who goes in \n               and takes the stairway up, preferring to walk.\n\n               The intercom squawks and Spergazzi answers the buzzer.\n\n<b>                                     MR.

Let \n                         me speak to the nurse, please.\n\n<b>                                     MR. SPERGAZZI (V.O.)\n</b>                         Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I \n                         think she must go to look for you.\n\n               St. Luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the \n               door. Merrick smiles and pulls it open for him. St. Luc \n               disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator.\n\n               As the stairway doors close, the elevators slide open and a \n               young couple come out heading for the main doors, dressed to \n               go out to a late party.\n\n               Before they reach the doors, Merrick slips through them and \n               meets the couple in the lobby. He smiles broadly as he \n               approaches them.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I \n                         wonder if I could talk to you for a \n                         second in my office?\n\n<b>                                     MISS LEWIS\n</b>                         Why don't you do something about all \n                         that noise? We like parties, but \n                         this is ridiculous.\n\n<b>                                     MERRICK\n</b>                         Well, there may be a connection. \n                         See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid \n                         somebody busted into it tonight.\n\n<b>                                     MISS LEWIS AND MR WOLF\n</b>                              (together)\n                         Oh, no!

I've got a few of the \n                         things they threw around in my office \n                         and if you could identify it...\n\n               The couple turn, grumbling, and walk toward Merrick's office. \n               Merrick follows, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n<b>               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The young couple enter the rental office, Merrick following \n               close behind. Once they are all in, Merrick closes the door. \n               He rests against the door and drools copiously, then giggles.\n\n               The young couple turn to look at him. Suddenly, three more \n               residents, two women and a man, all of them half naked, jump \n               down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets. The \n               residents begin to kiss and paw the couple. Merrick wipes \n               his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself \n               on top of the writhing mass.\n\n<b>               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Finding herself in the underground garage, Forsythe decides \n               to get in her car and drive out. She finds her car -- a Datsun \n               or Toyota -- gets in, throws the doctor's bag in the back, \n               and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors.\n\n               The car rolls over the cable which normally activates the \n               doors, but nothing happens. Forsythe puts the car in reverse \n               and backs over the cable, but still nothing happens. She \n               sits with the car idling, trying to figure out what to do \n               next.\n\n               Suddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the \n               doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her.\n\n               The doorman forces her down across the front seats of the \n               car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes \n               to shreds. He gradually forces himself between her legs.\n\n<b>               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               St. Luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for \n               Forsythe. He sees immediately that she is not there, but \n               also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the \n               garage.\n\n               He opens the garage door. Forsythe's screams come echoing \n               through the garage.\n\n<b>               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               St. Luc races through the garage, trying to find Forsythe. \n               He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and \n               runs over to it.\n\n               The doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of \n               the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster \n               and begins smashing away at the doorman with it.\n\n               The doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and \n               lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward \n               St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow.\n\n               The doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed \n               and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper \n               body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might \n               hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe.\n\n               St. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls \n               the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. \n               She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is \n               nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman.\n\n               St. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she \n               slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never \n               been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and \n               backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts \n               it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, \n               toward the garage door.\n\n               Another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of \n               the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in \n               swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete \n               post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats \n               and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, \n               who are emerging from their car.\n\n               One of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the \n               other two.\n\n               St. Luc drags Forsythe out of the car, throws her over his \n               shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door \n               leading to the incinerator.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAYS -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               St. Luc half drags, half carries Forsythe along hallways \n               whose doors are wide open. From the apartments issues the \n               entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds -- giggles, \n               moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks.\n\n               We catch glimpses of people of all kinds and ages locked \n               together on floors, chairs, etc. St. Luc finds an open exit \n               door and plunges through it, taking Forsythe with him.\n\n<b>               INT. GYM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The door to the gym opens and St. Luc looks in cautiously. \n               The gym is quite tiny and is deserted. St. Luc pulls Forsythe \n               in and closes the door. He lays Forsythe down on a gym mat \n               and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight-\n               lifting table.\n\n               He kneels beside Forsythe, who seems to be only just regaining \n               consciousness. St. Luc strokes her face, pushes strands of \n               hair matted with blood out of her eyes.\n\n<b>                                     ST.

Rollo'll be \n                         here soon.\n\n<b>               EXT. DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Rollo's car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a \n               blatantly illegal space. He flips up a card on the dash which \n               says 'M.D. ON CALL,' then gets out of the car.\n\n               He walks up the steps and through the main doors, which are \n               wide open. Nobody is in sight.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Rollo walks along the hallway, bag in hand, envelope under \n               arm. He stops in front of Tudor's door, checks the number \n               against the number written in his notebook, then knocks on \n               the door.\n\n               Nobody answers. He knocks once more, then looks around \n               shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in.\n\n<b>               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Rollo enters and closes the door behind him, deliberately \n               slamming it. He walks into the center of the living room and \n               bellows.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         Hello, good evening, is anybody here? \n                         Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to \n                         see you for consultation.\n\n               Still no answer. Rollo is puzzled. He snoops around the \n               apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half \n               closed. He pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?\n\n               Rollo can now see the figure of Tudor lying in bed in the \n               dim light of the bedroom. Rollo enters the bedroom.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr. \n                         Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here. \n                         He must be a little bit late.\n\n               Tudor does not answer, does not move. He lies stiffly on the \n               bed on his back, mouth insanely agape, eyes shut, covers \n               half on the floor.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is \n                         that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a \n                         look at you?\n\n               He stands at the edge of the bed, peering at Tudor, looking \n               for signs of consciousness. After a pause, he kneels on the \n               bed and slowly draws back the covers.\n\n<b>                                     ROLLO\n</b>                         Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't \n                         hurt.\n\n               Tudor's abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn \n               back. Crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged \n               blood parasites, which sits poised for only a fraction of a \n               second before it springs at Rollo's face with great energy.\n\n               As the thing hits Rollo's face it locks on to his head by \n               entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching \n               its suckers to his cheeks and chin.\n\n               Rollo tries to stand, then staggers and falls. The thing \n               tries to force its way into Rollo's mouth, cutting his lips \n               in the process. They bleed furiously. When Rollo manages to \n               pull a sucker away, a piece of his flesh comes with it.\n\n               As he writhes on the carpeted floor, two more parasites appear \n               crawling toward him from under the bed, covered with dust \n               from the floor. They clamber on to him and fasten on to his \n               face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. \n               One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. \n               Rollo screams in pain.\n\n               He manages to roll to his feet. He staggers out of the \n               darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm \n               extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still \n               locked on to his face. They try to pull his lips apart, but \n               he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing \n               their way into the depths of his body.\n\n               He takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. With a \n               sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the \n               kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment \n               on to the sink.\n\n               His hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a \n               hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by Tudor weeks \n               ago. Rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites \n               from his face with their steel jaws. The parasites, swollen \n               with Tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them \n               apart.\n\n               In the bedroom, Tudor's eyes snap open. His head rises from \n               the pillow.\n\n               He swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and \n               gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream. \n               He begins to mumble.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                         No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't. \n                         You mustn't kill them, no, no, no.\n\n               Then, as though listening to himself and suddenly \n               understanding what he is saying, he rises to his feet shakily \n               and walks to the kitchen. He stops at the kitchen door.\n\n               Rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding \n               away at them in the kitchen sink. The parasites wriggle and \n               curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at \n               them with the pliers.\n\n               Tudor staggers toward Rollo.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                         No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's \n                         my blood you're spilling! My blood! \n                         Let them come home, let them come \n                         home, home, home inside me. Don't \n                         kill them...!\n\n               He starts to paw Rollo, feebly trying to prevent him from \n               further mutilating the parasites. He reaches over St. Luc's \n               shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites.\n\n<b>                                     TUDOR\n</b>                              (whining pitifully)\n                         At least save me one!

His face is \n               melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the \n               corrosive fluid on one side. He stares in rage at Tudor.\n\n               With a scream, Rollo strikes Tudor with the pliers. Tudor \n               falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding \n               corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his \n               mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. \n               Rollo drops the pliers on the floor.\n\n               He stares at Tudor in shock. His face is reflected in a copper \n               frying pan hanging over the stove. Noticing the reflection, \n               Rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. He \n               gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering \n               and moaning.\n\n               Still shaking, he turns to leave.\n\n               Without warning, Tudor leaps up at Rollo with insane energy \n               and bowls him over, pliers in hand. Sitting on Rollo's chest, \n               Tudor smashes away at Rollo's face and head with the pliers, \n               the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to Rollo's \n               face as he drools.\n\n<b>               INT.

St. Luc manages to pin her hands \n               to her sides so that she can't pull the gag out.\n\n               Before St. Luc reaches the door, a handsome middle-aged woman \n               peeks in around the corner.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                              (crooning in reply to \n                              Forsythe's howl)\n                         Hellooooo?

STAIRWELL -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               As St. Luc begins to ascend the stairs, we can see tiny black \n               hooks tearing through Forsythe's gag. Blood begins to soak \n               through from the inside.\n\n               A group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing \n               above St. Luc and, noticing them, begin to walk down the \n               steps, moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures \n               toward the pair.\n\n               Blood is now pouring from Forsythe's mouth and tentacles are \n               groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin.\n\n               St. Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, \n               certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main doors.\n\n               As he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss \n               him, caress him, pull his clothes off. They finally manage \n               to drag Forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him \n               as they do so. St. Luc tries to prop her up on her feet, but \n               she's completely limp. St. Luc holds Forsythe against the \n               stairway wall as residents mill all about them. He looks at \n               her in sudden hopelessness.\n\n<b>                                     ST. LUC\n</b>                              (shouting)\n                         Forsythe!

The \n               residents are swarming all over them. St. Luc abandons \n               Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs.\n\n               He runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, \n               until he is free of the slow-moving residents. He leans back \n               against a wall, panting.\n\n               Crooning and moaning echo up to him from below.

A resident leans over and pulls the parasite \n               from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. Other \n               residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though \n               offering her a strange kind of comfort.\n\n               St. Luc reels with disgust and disbelief. He turns and runs.\n\n<b>               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Between the two towers lies the swimming pool. St. Luc manages \n               to reach the door leading from the South Tower into the pool. \n               He hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in \n               near exhaustion, then opens it and enters.\n\n               The pool is dim and tranquil. Two women are swimming in the \n               deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal.\n\n               St. Luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent \n               normalcy of the scene. Then he staggers forward, calling out \n               to the swimmers.\n\n<b>                                     ST. LUC\n</b>                         Have you seen the police?

The water ripples and bubbles near his feet. A \n               sinking feeling comes over him. He watches in horrible \n               fascination. He begins to shiver.\n\n               The ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. After a pause, \n               Janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. A few seconds later, \n               Betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery \n               calm. Betts gestures to St. Luc to join them in the pool.\n\n               St. Luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool.\n\n               He turns to leave the room. As he turns, Mr. Spergazzi appears \n               out of the shadows behind him. Using his four-pronged aluminum \n               cane, he pushes St. Luc backwards into the pool, chuckling \n               playfully.\n\n               Spergazzi looks around for approval as St. Luc begins to \n               thrash about wildly.\n\n               Betts swims up beside St. Luc, grabs him, and holds him under.\n\n<b>                                     BETTS\n</b>                              (to Janine)\n                         A kiss!\n                              (laughter echoes in \n                              the pool room)\n                         Give him a kiss.

St. Luc's \n               cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth. His eyes \n               jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, \n               revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like \n               grappling irons.\n\n               St. Luc twists out of Betts' grasp. He and Janine, still \n               locked together, sink beneath the surface.\n\n               Dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join Spergazzi \n               and the others at the poolside. Among these are faces already \n               familiar to us: Kurt, Kresimir and Benda, the old laundry-\n               room woman, etc.\n\n               The new spectators clap, laugh, croon, and moan as though \n               witnessing a wild group baptism. Some of them throw themselves \n               into the water, pulling others in with them.\n\n               Deep under the water's surface, St. Luc still struggles to \n               free himself from Janine.

His throat swells monstrously. Janine releases \n               him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip \n               back into his mouth. He exhales heavily as parasite enzymes \n               pump furiously through his body.

We rise higher and higher above the Starliner Towers \n               apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of lights \n               far below, bleeding into the main body of the neon-lit \n               metropolis.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Shivers.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Shivers</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Cronenberg\" title=\"Scripts by David Cronenberg\">David Cronenberg</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Shivers Script.html#comments\" title=\"Shivers comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:22.724297"}
