COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1\r\n</b>    A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun\r\n    dips behind the mountains.\r\n\r\n    In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the\r\n    sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and\r\n    very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an\r\n    invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of\r\n    transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve\r\n    settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA\r\n    ADJUSTS and reveals--\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2\r\n</b>    Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur\r\n    repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But\r\n    now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long\r\n    shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly\r\n    from within; it's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly. If\r\n    the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW\r\n    MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with\r\n    flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.\r\n\r\n    As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE\r\n    rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to\r\n    enclose them all, he goes inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3\r\n</b>    This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a\r\n    funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin\r\n    curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering\r\n    ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a\r\n    neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM\r\n    through the room and down the hallways lined with fading\r\n    wallpaper.\r\n\r\n<b>                        VOICES\r\n</b>                  (various)\r\n              --where did she go...? ... was\r\n              here a moment ago...

Ready or not,\r\n                 here we come...\r\n\r\n    All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured\r\n    tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage\r\n    alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and\r\n    opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys...\r\n    and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky\r\n    clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.\r\n\r\n<b>                            VOICES (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 ...There you are, you naughty girl!\r\n                 You almost made us lose the\r\n                 sunset...

CAMERA PANS\r\n    across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet.\r\n\r\n    In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we\r\n    watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person\r\n    steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing\r\n    around are other people, some already dripping wet, others\r\n    awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in\r\n    varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off,\r\n    slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris\r\n    splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes\r\n    his hair back.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>                                                              3.\r\n</b><b>    CONTINUED: (2)\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                            HARRIS\r\n</b>                 No, Victor, it's not okay.

This is one of them.\r\n\r\n    He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia,\r\n    Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a\r\n    smile that inspires trust.\r\n\r\n<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 Cynthia, do you trust me?\r\n\r\n    She nods immediately.\r\n\r\n<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 And have I ever lied to you?\r\n\r\n    She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia\r\n    begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing;\r\n    others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held\r\n    by their parents and playfully splashed.\r\n\r\n<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 Then I say to you now... to all of\r\n                 you now... that this will be the\r\n                 Ultimate Joining... of man and\r\n                 woman... parent and child...\r\n                 humanity and Godhead.\r\n\r\n    He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go,\r\n    gets in. Now only Cynthia remains.\r\n\r\n<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 Cynthia. Come. There is no shame\r\n                 in this. No crime. No sin.

Moving like a\r\n    sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she\r\n    stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs\r\n    her hand through it. Her eyes widen.\r\n<b>                                                               4.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>6   EXT.
