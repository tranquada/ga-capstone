Lightning flashes to reveal Prince\r\n          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open\r\n          plains.

Charming straddles a\r\n          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a\r\n          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another\r\n          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.\r\n          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound\r\n          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back\r\n          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and\r\n          lightning.

KNIGHTING CEREMONY - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song\r\n          \"Royal Pain\" by the Eels plays in the background as the\r\n          title: \"Shrek The Third\" is superimposed.\r\n                         \r\n          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek\r\n          walks down the aisle of the church.\r\n                         \r\n          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.\r\n                         \r\n          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea\r\n          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who\r\n          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek\r\n          starts to knight the knight.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHREK\r\n           I knight thee...\r\n                         \r\n          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHREK\r\n           He-he.

He leans on the\r\n          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws\r\n          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the\r\n          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.\r\n                         \r\n          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their\r\n          heads as they leave.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

VROOM! VROOM! He\r\n          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind\r\n          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.\r\n                         \r\n          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into\r\n          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.\r\n                         \r\n          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.\r\n                         \r\n                          FIONA\r\n           Ow!\r\n           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Lipstick is applied to some lips.

It keeps\r\n          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and\r\n          tighten up the zipper all the way.\r\n                         \r\n          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot.

Evil Dwarves\r\n          glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks\r\n          by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)\r\n          playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and\r\n          the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.\r\n          Prince Charming walks by the singing witch.

The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies\r\n          onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,\r\n          and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the\r\n          tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.\r\n          Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One\r\n          of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs\r\n          over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a\r\n          baby out of the cauldron.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHREK\r\n           Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?\r\n           No, no. Stop!

The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking\r\n          about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from\r\n          him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone\r\n          else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and\r\n          shaking hands.\r\n                         \r\n          Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight.

He grabs a sword from the discard pile and\r\n          raises it up, his aim set at Artie.\r\n                         \r\n                          PRINCE CHARMING\r\n           Aaaahhhh!\r\n                         \r\n          Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As\r\n          Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break\r\n          his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain\r\n          whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls\r\n          Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,\r\n          he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets\r\n          go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,\r\n          and falls to the floor, groaning.\r\n                         \r\n          Prince Charming beams, and laughs.
