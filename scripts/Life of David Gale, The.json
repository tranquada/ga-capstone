TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE\n\n               A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely \n               highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through \n               the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The \n               sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO \n               into the mist.\n\n               She runs, and runs.\n\n               She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.\n\n               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a \n               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.\n\n               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               WHITE\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. OFFICE OF \"DEATHWATCH AUSTIN\" - SUNRISE\n\n               A clock on the wall: 6:11.\n\n               Beneath the clock a simple banner reads \"DeathWatch Austin.\"\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN (O.S.)\n                         It's probably been about seven \n                         minutes...\n\n               The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled \n               with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.\n\n               About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.\n\n               Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with \n               a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer \n               screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs \n               quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a \n               phone to one ear.\n\n               The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.\n\n               CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE \n               (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at \n               nothing. She bites her lip.\n\n                                     COLLEGE GUY\n                         Okay. Okay.

I'll do it.\n\n               He nods to her, exits.\n\n               She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she \n               marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male.\n\n               The wall clock reads 6:13.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE\n\n               The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going \n               to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty \n               parking lot to Volvo station wagon.\n\n               As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the \n               capitol building in the distance.\n\n               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE\n\n               David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.\n\n               EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE\n\n               David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop \n               inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.\n\n               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE\n\n               He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind \n               him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the \n               reflection of the rising sun.\n\n               BACK TO DAVID\n\n               He stares, then:\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Hey!\n\n               The cop ignores him.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Yo!

He reaches back for the \n               belt. David takes a sip and drives on.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               WHITE\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               CLOSE ON TELEVISION\n\n               Court TV reporter, Roberts, stands in front of the Supreme \n               Court.\n\n                                     ROBERTS (V.O.)\n                         The high court also refused to stay \n                         Friday's execution of former \n                         philosophy professor, David Gale.\n\n                                     FEMALE (O.S.)\n                              (with her mouth full)\n                         Christ doin' Karaoke.\n\n               PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:\n\n               INT.

It's called \n                         objectivity.\n\n               They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to \n               read, affects a shiver.\n\n               EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a \n               few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse \n               is a sign: \"TDC Ellis Unit.

ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n               Bitsey and Zack get out of their car.

Guard towers \n               rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building \n               with a sign: \"REPORT HERE.\"\n\n               Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the \n               building.\n\n               Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny \n               Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty \n               yards away. He watches them neutrally.\n\n               CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a \n               series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. \n               Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) \n               stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim \n               skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside \n               him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back \n               against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white \n               guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the \n               building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger \n               (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the \n               chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.\n\n               INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE\n\n               As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is \n               on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a \n               wait-just-a-second finger.\n\n                                     GROVER\n                         Well, I don't rightly know one \n                         fraternity from another.

It is seamlessly intersected by \n               curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth \n               is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look \n               like they are in a sound booth.\n\n               Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the \n               visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each \n               section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center \n               is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. \n               This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).\n\n               On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs \n               trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone \n               hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless \n               steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.\n\n                                     GROVER\n                              (calling out to Belyeu)\n                         All yours, Mr. Belyeu.\n                              (to Bitsey and Zack)\n                         You folks have safe visit now.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Thank you.\n\n               He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and \n               David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.\n\n               Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard \n               Yard.\n\n                                     BELYEU\n                         Miss Bloom?\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Yes.\n\n               Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly.

Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth \n               Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic \n               wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum \n               blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         That's me.

We thought this \n                         would be like a busy week -- Gale \n                         gettin' the prune juice and all. \n                         Prune juice is what death row dudes \n                         call the poison, 'cause it gives you \n                         the shits. Most jerks just take a \n                         photo from the street. They shot a \n                         'Real Crimes' episode here, but the \n                         owner didn't give us dick.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         You don't mind living here?\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         I'm cool with ghouls.

Among her own things, a \n               dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler \n               (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has \n               been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         She let him crash here sometimes.

The Goth Girl moves into \n               the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various \n               areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- \n               the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the \n               patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty \n               pots with dead plants lying around.\n\n               By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined \n               and indexed (#2).\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         This is where the tripod was. My \n                         boyfriend borrowed the one we usually \n                         show folks. They never found a camera, \n                         photos, or videos or anything. Gale \n                         must have buried them.

On the linoleum, the position of \n               Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are \n               a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing \n               tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on \n               the sink counter (#6).\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         She was like totally naked right \n                         here. The meter man saw her through \n                         the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped \n                         her mouth, then taped a bag over her \n                         head so she couldn't breathe. My \n                         boyfriend says that's probably when \n                         he fucked her. Your muscles tense up \n                         when you die -- the sex is better.\n                              (pointing)\n                         He used those housewife gloves so he \n                         wouldn't leave prints.

She \n               winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.\n\n               EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT\n\n               The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands \n               at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a \n               calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: \n               There's a liquor store.\n\n               CLOSEUP - RECEIVER\n\n               at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS.\n\n               BACK ON DAVID\n\n               He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Sharon, pick up.

CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY\n\n               Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward \n               her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. \n               David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, \n               holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio \n               Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy \n               drunk.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.\n\n                                     CONSTANCE\n                         Come on, come inside.\n\n               She opens the door as he stands.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         We fell off our wagon.\n\n               INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of \n               the couch, holding the sheep.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Know why Saint Jude is the patron \n                         saint of lost causes? 'Cause his \n                         real name was Judas. There were two \n                         Judases, Judai, the saint guy and \n                         the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, \n                         and tried to kiss him. Medievalers \n                         wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear \n                         of getting bad Judas on the line by \n                         mistake. Ergo, they only gave him \n                         business when really desperate. That's \n                         why. Then they changed his name.\n\n               She's not in the room.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Constance?\n\n               He looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly \n               blows along the floor into the living room.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Your mail's blowing.\n\n               He looks in the entry hall.\n\n               ENTRY HALL\n\n               Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door. \n               The mail is scattered about her.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY\n\n               David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack \n               of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM \n               can be heard throughout the scene.\n\n               A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes \n               his shoulder.

The kitchen is cleaner \n               than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.\n\n               Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside \n               out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on \n               the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner \n               of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.\n\n               The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR \n               contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so \n               can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.\n\n               Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to \n               life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then \n               jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the \n               counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her \n               stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She \n               desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip \n               the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her \n               covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to \n               rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.\n\n               EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK\n\n               Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate \n               and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.\n\n               After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Belyeu says to bring the tape first \n                         thing tomorrow.

KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. \n               The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack \n               of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the \n               distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they \n               wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Let's say Gale's right.

BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table \n               looking out the window. Rain shadows run down their faces. \n               The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17.\n\n               EXT. MOTEL SIX AND KETTLE - LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS\n\n               INTERSTATE - NIGHT\n\n               The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in \n               ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after \n               another.\n\n               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey, \n               lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her \n               perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to \n               her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note \n               pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She \n               turns on the TV and waits for an image.\n\n               EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT\n\n               Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within \n               comes a TV glow.\n\n               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - INSERT - BITSEY'S\n\n               NOTEPAD - NIGHT\n\n               She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements \n               timed out.\n\n               BITSEY\n\n               has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a \n               bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated.\n\n               Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands, \n               looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the \n               floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, \n               stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits \n               her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She \n               spits, hurries into the bedroom.\n\n               INT.

Get up!\n\n               He starts to pull himself awake.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Did you throw the towel on the floor?\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         What?\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         The towel on my bathroom floor.

The tripod's back. The other \n               exhibit pieces haven't changed.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         And for the next hour I want you to \n                         do exactly what I say when I say to \n                         do it.

Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC \n               DOWN.\n\n               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER\n\n               Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a \n               perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit \n               pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-\n               less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, \n               she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.\n\n                                     ZACK (O.S.)\n                         Move those index cards, too.\n\n               She picks up the index cards.\n\n               Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is \n               on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the \n               hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, \n               freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the \n               Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-\n               side.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Zoom in a hair.\n\n               He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV \n               (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Put the gloves on a dish rack.\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         I don't have one.\n\n               Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter \n               as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over \n               them.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Turn them inside out.\n\n               He does so.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Move the tape roll about a foot to \n                         the left. And get rid of the \n                         handcuffs.\n\n               Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the \n               handcuffs.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Come check this, Zack.\n                              (to the Goth Girl)\n                         Could you... what's your name?\n\n                                     GOTH GIRL\n                         Nico's cool.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Nico, lie down on the floor, facing \n                         the counter.\n\n               Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits \n               on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         We can imagine that part.\n                              (to Bitsey)\n                         I'll position her.\n\n               He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance \n               (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the \n               floor).\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         That's fine. Just straighten her \n                         legs.\n\n               Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the \n               two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape, \n               however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower \n               right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         What's this?\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Towel or something.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Okay, look at this.\n\n               She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         I noticed this back at the hotel. \n                         See?\n\n               Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.\n\n               The foot moves ever so slightly.

Almost martyrs don't count. \n                         What's one murder to stop thousands?\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         So he'll wait, release the whole \n                         tape after the execution.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Right. Somewhere he must have the \n                         original. What time is it?\n\n               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a \n               BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.\n\n                                     DUSTY\n                         Hello?\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.\n\n               Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates \n               the area -- its light catching the drizzle.\n\n               Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey \n               waits by the rental car.\n\n               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n               Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands \n               just outside.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Let's talk about your tape... No, \n                         meet me at the station down the hill, \n                         in fifteen minutes.\n\n               Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the \n               booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Dusty hangs up, thinks.\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the \n               booth.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Don't move from the booth. Call the \n                         second you see the truck. Remember, \n                         let it ring just once. Then get into \n                         the woods --\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         I know.

WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup. \n               She hurries to the front door, enters.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11 \n               videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.\n\n               She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands \n               are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.\n\n               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n               Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.\n\n               She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do \n               so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04. \n               She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a \n               city council meeting.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                              (hitting eject)\n                         Shit!\n\n               She grabs the next unlabeled tape.\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey has an old \"I Love Lucy\" episode. Ejects, looks at \n               the label: \"Lucy.\" She grabs another, labeled \"Unforgiven.\" \n               The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Shit!\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, \n               drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch \n               the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong \n               to a car. He quickly hangs up.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson \n               interview with Pavarotti.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Shit!\n\n               She reaches for another.\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Come on. Fucking come on.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT CABIN\n\n               Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She \n               goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up \n               on the screen. She hits eject.\n\n               She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the \n               bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, \n               indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly \n               rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.\n\n               She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.\n\n               After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.\n\n               It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to \n               \"Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New \n               York 10036.\" A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it \n               open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: \n               \"Constance.\" The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at \n               the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring \n               again. A beat of absolute silence.\n\n               Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands \n               shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in \n               her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing \n               the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.\n\n               ON VIDEO\n\n               Constance turns from the sink:\n\n                                     CONSTANCE (V.O.)\n                              (her voice weak)\n                         Ready?\n\n               The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites \n               her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from \n               the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down \n               with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She \n               puts the glass in the sink.\n\n               She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks \n               one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another \n               small section, drops the roll on the floor.\n\n               She tapes the small section over her mouth.\n\n               She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it \n               a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes \n               watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts \n               the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air \n               out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. \n               She seals the bag around her neck.\n\n               She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and \n               she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them \n               upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's \n               nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom \n               right hand corner of the screen.\n\n               She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.\n\n               She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her \n               side, perfectly still, waiting.\n\n               ON BITSEY\n\n               Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the \n               part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she \n               fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she \n               dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.\n\n               VIDEO\n\n               A man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty.\n\n               ON BITSEY\n\n               This is what she's needed.\n\n               VIDEO\n\n               Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks \n               her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.\n\n               He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. \n               We see only Constance's dead body -- then black.\n\n               ON BITSEY\n\n               A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around.\n\n               It's Zack, breathing hard.\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         He didn't show! Fuckin' move!\n\n               Bitsey hits the eject button.\n\n               EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.\n\n               The pickup is nowhere to be seen.\n\n               As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing \n               beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.\n\n               EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE\n\n               The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle \n               has stopped.\n\n               INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse \n               in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book.\n\n               She's almost in tears, yelling.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         Everyone! Wake up New York, the \n                         warden, the Governor, the goddamn \n                         Supreme Court death clerk! How far \n                         is it?\n\n                                     ZACK\n                         Took me 30 this afternoon. You've \n                         got 26, maybe more.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                         I'll make it.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE\n\n               The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate \n               shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He \n               runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.\n\n               EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE\n\n               The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring \n               stop signs.\n\n               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE\n\n               The rental car flies past a \"Huntsville City Limit\" sign and \n               disappears into the fog.\n\n               INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE\n\n               The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns \n               on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on.\n\n               She punches scan.\n\n                                     BITSEY\n                              (to the radio)\n                         Give me the time. Give me the goddamn \n                         time.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE\n\n               The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork \n               reads: \"TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles.\"\n\n               INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE\n\n               Bitsey smells something.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE\n\n               The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a \n               dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.\n\n               She doesn't close the door. Starts running.\n\n               Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The \n               rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility \n               is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and \n               SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.\n\n               She runs, and runs.\n\n               A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, \n               starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves \n               around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.\n\n               She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past \n               a sleepy farmhouse.\n\n               She runs, and runs.\n\n               She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.\n\n               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a \n               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.\n\n               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.\n\n               Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. \n               They rise on hill and then fall behind another.\n\n               They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an \n               ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move \n               slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their \n               cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. \n               The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked \"Texas \n               Department of Corrections\" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. \n               She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW \n               MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot \n               hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.\n\n               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - SUNRISE\n\n               In the b.g., Dusty walks out the front door carrying two \n               large suitcases.
