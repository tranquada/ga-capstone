CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY\n</b>\nA gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the\nFAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo,\nalmost under her breath.\n\n<b>                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)\n</b>           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me\n           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life\n           for me...\n\nSuddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged\nVictory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought,\nthe H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five\ngun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot.\n\n<b>EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY\n</b>\nELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow\nrailing, gazing at the seas, still singing --\n\n<b>                     ELIZABETH\n</b>           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...\n\nJOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather,\nclutches her shoulder, startling her.\n\n<b>                     GIBBS\n</b>               (sotto)\n           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail\n           these waters. You want to call\n           'em down on us?\n\nElizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.\n\n<b>                        NORRINGTON\n</b>           Mr. Gibbs.\n\nNORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core,\nglares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNOR\nWEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass\nbuttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's\nfather.\n\n<b>                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)\n</b>           That will do.\n<b>\n</b><b>                    GIBBS\n</b>          She was singing about pirates.\n          Bad luck to sing about pirates,\n          with us mired in this unnatural\n          fog-- mark my words.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          Consider them marked.   On your\n          way.\n\n<b>                    GIBBS\n</b>          'Aye, Captain.\n              (as he moves off)\n          Bad luck to have a woman on board,\n          too.

Vile and\n          dissolute creatures, the  lot of\n          them. I intend to see to   it that\n          any man who sails under a  pirate\n          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,\n          gets what he deserves: a  short\n          drop and a sudden stop.\n\nElizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden\nstop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.\n\n<b>                    SWAN\n</b>          Captain Norrington... I appreciate\n          your fervor, but I am concerned about\n          the effect this subject will have on\n          my daughter.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          My apologies, Governor.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Actually, I find it all fascinating.\n\n<b>                    SWAN\n</b><b>\n</b>          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,\n          dear... we will be landing in Port\n          Royal very soon, and beginning our new\n          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we\n          comport ourselves as befits our class\n          and station?\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Yes, father.\n\nChastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\n</b>              (to herself)\n          I still think it would be exciting\n          to meet a pirate...\n\nThe fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is\nvisible --\n\n-- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy,\nWILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty\nwater. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how\nhe came to be there.\n\n<b>                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\n</b>          Look!   A boy! In the water!\n\nNorrington and Swann spot him --\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          Man overboard!\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Boy overboard!\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of\n          there!\n\nQuick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use a\nboathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington and\nSwann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth\nsidles in for a closer look.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)\n</b>          He's still breathing.\n\n<b>                     SWAN\n</b><b>\n</b>          Where did he come from?\n\n<b>                    GIBBS\n</b>          Mary mother of God ...\n\nAttention is turned away from the boy --\n\nThe sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters\nthe water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is\nleft of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag\nhanging limply from the stern.\n\nThe H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   The\nscene calls for hushed voices.\n\n<b>                    SWAN\n</b>          What happened here?\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          An explosion in the powder magazine.\n          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.\n\n<b>                    GIBBS\n</b>          Lot of good it did them...\n              (off Swan's look)\n          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just\n          saying it! Pirates!\n\n<b>                    SWAN\n</b>          There is no proof of that. It could\n          have been an accident. Captain, these\n          men were protection. If there is even\n          the slightest chance one of those poor\n          devils is still alive, we cannot\n          abandon them!\n\n<b>                     NORRINGTON\n</b>          Of course not, Governor.\n              (to the crew)\n          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash\n          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off\n          the cannons!\n              (to Swann)\n          Hope for the best...prepare for\n          the worst.\n              (to two sailors)\n          Move the boy aft. We'll need the\n          deck clear.\n<b>\n</b>They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the\nrail, away from the hideous scene in the water.\n\n<b>                    SWAN\n</b>          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany\n          the boy. He's in your charge now.\n          You'll watch over him?\n\nElizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow\nthe longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop\ndeck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneels\ndown besides the boy.\n\nHis good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,\ngently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --\n\nSuddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is\nstartled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          My name is Elizabeth Swann.\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          Will Turner.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          I'm watching over you, Will.\n\nHe clutches her hands, then slips back into\nunconsciousness.\n\nHis movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth\nsees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,\nrevealing--\n\nA GOLD MEDALLION.   One side is blank.   She turns it over --\n\nA SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to\nher eyes, it means one thing only:\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\n</b>          You're a pirate.\n\nShe glances back at the crew.   Sees Norrington, giving\norders, moving toward her.\n\nShe looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes\nthe medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her\ncoat.\n<b>\n</b>Norrington arrives.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          Did he speak?\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          His name is Will Turner -- that's\n          all I found out.\n\n<b>                       NORRINGTON\n</b>          Very good.\n\nNorrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the stern\nof the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. A\nwisp of wind, and she looks up --\n\nOut over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a\nghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --\n\nIt has BLACK SAILS.\n\nElizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.\n\nThe ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not\nthe mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull\nand crossbones of the Jolly Roger.\n\nElizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on\nthe flag is the same as the one on the medallion.\n\nFog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for\nthe black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to\nTURN and GRIN at her --\n\nElizabeth shuts her eyes tight --\n\n<b>                       EIGHT YEARS LATER\n</b>\n<b>INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.\n\nBut this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on\nthe stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old\nElizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.\n\nShe remains motionless (were the images we just saw a\nnightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)\n<b>\n</b>Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as\npossible without moving. Might there be someone in the\nroom with her, looming over her?\n\nShe turns, ready for anything.   She is alone.\n\nElizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp\nbesides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the\nroom to a dressing table, sits down.\n\nShe pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches\ninto a space beneath it and removes --\n\nThe MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not\nlost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it\nas she absently returns the draw to its place --\n\nA BOOMING knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startled\nknocking over her chair.\n\n<b>                    SWANN (O.S.)\n</b>          Elizabeth? Is everything all\n          right? Are you decent?\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Yes -- yes.\n\nShe puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as\nSwann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,\nESTRELLA, follows.\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Still abed at this hour?    It's a\n          beautiful day!\n\nEstrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:\n\nBeneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,\nbuilt on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the\nharbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with\ncannon.\n\n<b>                    SWANN (CONT'D)\n</b>          I have a gift for you.\n\nHe opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet\ndress. She lets out an admiring gasp.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b><b>\n</b>          It's -- beautiful. May I inquire\n          as to the occasion?\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Is an occasion necessary for a father\n          to dote upon his daughter with gifts?\n\nElizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-\noff dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.\n\n<b>                    SWANN (CONT'D)\n</b>          Although...I did think you could\n          wear it to the ceremony today.\n\n<b>                       ELIZABETH (O.S.)\n</b>          Ceremony?\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Captain Norrington's promotion\n          ceremony.\n\nElizabeth peeks around the screen.\n\n<b>                       ELIZABETH\n</b>          I knew it.\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a\n          fine gentleman, don't you think?\n              (no answer)\n          He fancies you, you know.\n\nBehind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.\n\n<b>                       SWANN (CONT'D)\n</b>          Elizabeth?     How's it coming?\n\nON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and      the medallion (still\naround her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches her\ninto a corset over her slip. Estrella       has her foot in\nElizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Difficult ... to say.\n\n<b>                    SWANN (O.S.)\n</b>          I'm told that dress is the very latest\n          fashion in London.\n<b>\n</b><b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>              (holding her breath)\n          Women in London must have learned to\n          not breath.\n\nEstrella is finished.   Elizabeth takes a breath -- and\nwinces.\n\nA butler appears in the doorway of the room.\n\n<b>                    BUTLER\n</b>          Governor? A caller is here for\n          you.\n\n<b>INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY\n</b>\nThe caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,\nlooking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long\npresentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on\nthe back of his calves, but it doesn't help.\n\n<b>                     SWANN\n</b>          Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see\n          you again!\n\nThe caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a\nwatchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          Good day, sir.\n              (holds out the case)\n          I have your order.\n\nSwann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a\nbeautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out\nreverently.\n\n<b>                    WILL (CONT'D)\n</b>\n<b>                    WILL (CONT'D)\n</b>          The blade is folded steel. That's\n          gold filigree laid into the\n          handle. If I may -\n\nHe takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one\nfinger at the point where the blade meets the guard.\n\n<b>                    WILL (CONT'D)\n</b><b>\n</b>          Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly\n          the full width of the blade..\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Impressive. .. very impressive.\n          Commodore Norrington will be pleased,\n          I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to\n          your master.\n\nWill's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is\nproud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword\naround, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>              (bows slightly)\n          I shall. A craftsman is always pleased\n          to hear his work is appreciated --\n\nHe stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -\n\nElizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be\npainful to wear, but holy smokes!\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Elizabeth! You look stunning!\n\nWill tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to\nhimself, and simply nods emphatically.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Will! It's so good to see you!\n\nHer hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion\nis hidden in the bodice of her dress).\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\n</b>          I dreamt about you last night.\n          Will reacts with surprise:\n          \"Really?\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Elizabeth, this is hardly\n          appropriate -\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>              (ignores her father)\n          About the day we met.

Now, we must be\n          going.\n\nSwann takes the case from Will, opens the door for\nElizabeth.\n\nElizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and\nstrides past Will.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Good day, Mr. Turner.\n\n<b>EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY\n</b>\nSwann follows Elizabeth out the door.\n\n<b>                      WILL\n</b>          Good day.\n\nHe watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the\ndriver.\n\n<b>                     WILL (CONT'D)\n</b>              (to himself)\n          Elizabeth.\n\nIN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit\n          more decorum in front of Commodore\n          Norrington. After all, it is only\n<b>\n</b>          through his efforts that Port Royal has\n          become at all civilized.\n\n<b>EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY\n</b>\nThe skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in\nbuccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky\npromontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a\nsign:\n\n<b>PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.\n</b>\nThe top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of\nthem. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in\nthe rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling\nrogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.\n\nHe gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a\ntankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his\nattention. He jumps from the rigging -\n\n-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an\nimposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a\nsingle sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.\n\nAnd it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.\n\nJack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to\ncontrol the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the\npromontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.\n\nThe huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates\nthe bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the\nH.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and\na mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at\nthe Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort\nCharles.\n\n<b>EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY\n</b>\nSmoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the\nsail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The\nHARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there\nto catch a line and help Jack tie up.\n\n<b>                    HARBORMASTER\n</b>          If you're out rolling scuppers in\n          this tub, you're either incredibly\n          brave or incredibly stupid.\n<b>\n</b><b>                    JACK\n</b>          It's remarkable how often those\n          two traits coincide.\n\nHe starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides\nthe scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small\npowder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.\n\n<b>                    HARBORMASTER\n</b>          It's a shilling for the dock\n          space, and you're going to have to\n          give me your name.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          What do you say to three\n          shillings, and we forget the name?\n\nHe tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster\nconsiders, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.\n\n<b>                    HARBORMASTER\n</b>          Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.\n\nJack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across\nthe water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the\nInterceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony\nis underway -\n\n<b>EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY\n</b>\nWith choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and\nscabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed\nNavy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it\nout vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.\n\nNorrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and\nSwann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the\nsword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann\nsteps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps\nback.\n\nNorrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow\nofficers, turns again and nods to the audience -\ndignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.\nAnother flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.\n\nThe silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from\nthe Navy men.\n<b>\n</b>In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out\nbeneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.\nDiscreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material\nof the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her\ndiscomfort.\n\n<b>EXT.

The pistol\nsails into the water. Before   anyone  can react to that, Jack\nhas the manacle chain wrapped   around  Elizabeth's throat.\n\nPistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a\nshield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>              (backing away, toward land)\n          Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and\n          belt, please.\n\nNorrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.\n\n<b>                       JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Commodore!\n\nMullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington\nholds them out to Jack.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth is more angry than frightened.\n\nELIZABETH Miss Swann.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?\n<b>\n</b>She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's\nquicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He\njerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Now, if you'll be very kind?\n\nShe figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>              (as she works)\n          You are despicable.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          I saved your life; now you've\n          saved mine. We're square.\n\nDone. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps\nagainst the cargo gantry.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will\n          always remember this as the day\n          you almost caught Captain Jack\n          Sparrow.\n\nHe shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a\nbelaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up\nto the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -\n\nPistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away\nand around from the gantry.\n\nNorrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks\nJack's trajectory-\n\nJack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot\ntears the rope -\n\n-- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he\nsnaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs\nhold of the far loop -- slides down the line -\n\n-- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another\nship, then out of sight -\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          On his heels! Gillette, bring a\n          squad down from the fort!\n<b>\n</b>              (to Elizabeth)\n          Elizabeth, are you -\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go\n          capture him.\n\nNorrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries\naway. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.\n\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          Here, dear ... you should wear this.\n\nElizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.\nGlances out at the bay -\n\n-- where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. She\ntakes the jacket.\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          Thank you, Father ... and let that\n          be the last of your fashion\n          advice, please.\n\nBut she accepts his comforting embrace.\n\n<b>EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\nThe fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An\narmed search party moves along the street. They glance down\nan alley-\n\nOn the far side is another search party. The men nod to\neach other, continue on.\n\nA moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath\nthe eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.\n\nAcross the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru\ndoor set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.\n\n<b>INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY\n</b>\nJack slips in through the door, takes a look around:\n\nNo windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in-\nprogress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron\ngates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every\ntool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat.\n<b>\n</b>Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a\nblacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a\nbottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,\nturns away.\n\nSatisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled\nsledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing\ncoke furnace in the middle of the room.\n\nSlowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the\nchain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack\nsweats, grimaces at the pain -\n\nMoving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an\nanvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on\nthe glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,\nplunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam\nbillows.\n\nJack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath\nthe manacle -- but his hands are free.\n\nThe SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.\n\nWill enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the\ndrunken Mister Brown in the corner.\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          Right where I left you.\n\nSomething catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The\nsledge lying beside the anvil.\n\n<b>                    WILL (CONT'D)\n</b>              (under his breath)\n          Not where I left you.\n\nHe moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --\nbut the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps\nback.\n\nJack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,\ntoward the door. Will glares at him.\n\n<b>                    WILL (CONT' D)\n</b>              (voice low and tight)\n          You're the one they're hunting.\n          The pirate.\n<b>\n</b>Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then\nfrowns, regards Will.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          You look familiar ... Have I ever\n          threatened you before?\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          I've made a point of avoiding\n          familiarity with pirates.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          Ah. Then it would be a shame to\n          put a black mark on your record.\n          So if you'll excuse me ...\n\nBeside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in\nthe honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it\nin hand.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Do you think this is wise, boy?\n          Crossing blades with a pirate?\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          You threatened Miss Swann.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          Only a little.\n\nIn response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack\nappraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.\n\nJack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading\nfeints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost\nimpossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          You know what you're doing, I'll\n          give you that ... Excellent form\n          ... But how's your footwork? If I\n          step here -\n\nHe takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the\nother way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Very good! And if I step again,\n          you step again. . .\n<b>\n</b>              (continuing to step\n               around the circle)\n          And so we circle, circle, like\n          dogs we circle. . .\n\nThey are now exactly opposite their initial positions.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Ta!\n\nJack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.\n\nWill registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious\noverhand motion, he throws his sword -\n\n-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the\nlatch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls\non the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the\nway.\n\nJack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it\nis really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he\nturns back to Will, he's smiling.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT' D)\n</b>          That's a good trick. Except, once\n          again, you are between me and the\n          way out.\n              (points his sword at the\n               back door)\n          And now you have no weapon.\n\nEyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an\nanvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.\n\nWill and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,\nJack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at\nWill's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.\n\nThen Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming\nhim.\n\nWill quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware\nthat the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,\nknives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Who makes all these?\n<b>\n</b><b>                    WILL\n</b>          I do. And I practice with them. At\n          least three hours a day.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          You need to find yourself a girl.\n              (Will sets his jaw)\n          Or maybe the reason you practice\n          three hours a day is you've found\n          one -- but can't get her?\n\nA direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with\nanger.\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          No. I practice three hours a day\n          so that when I meet a pirate ... I\n          can kill him.\n\nHe explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his\nhand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the\nair, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.\n\nJack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps\naround Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard\nthrough a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -\n\nSo Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the\nceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and\ndodging around the furnace -\n\nJack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS\ninto Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,\nkicks with his feet, knocking Will back.\n\nJack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the\nceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,\nhitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls\ndown, gets up -\n\nJack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.\n\nWill steps back, directly in front of the back exit.\nGlares, rubs his wrist gingerly.\n\n<b>                    WILL (CONT'D)\n</b>          You cheated.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b><b>\n</b>              (smiles; what do you expect?)\n          Pirate.\n\nJack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the\ndoor.\n\n<b>                       JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Move away.\n\n<b>                       WILL\n</b>          No.\n\n<b>                       JACK\n</b>          Move!\n\n<b>                    WILL\n</b>          No. I can not just step aside and\n          let you escape.\n\nJack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off\nlasts for a long moment.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          You're lucky, boy -- this shot's\n          not meant for you.\n\nJack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack\n<b>-\n</b>\nSuddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's\nskull. Jack crumples to the ground.\n\nThe front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the\nroom. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          Excellent work, Mister Brown.\n          You've aided in the capture of a\n          dangerous fugitive.\n\n<b>                    BROWN\n</b>          Just doing my civic duty.\n\nJack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.\n\n<b>                    NORRINGTON\n</b>          I believe you will always remember\n          this as the day Captain Jack\n          Sparrow almost escaped.\n<b>\n</b>Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go.\nBrown looks at his bottle -- broken.\n\n<b>                    BROWN\n</b>          That ratter broke my bottle.\n\n<b>EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town.\n\nThe only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the\n\nbluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey.\n\nAbove the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A\nwaxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow.\n\n<b>ANGLE - FORT CHARLES,\n</b>\njust below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly\ndeep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the\nwater: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying\nfrom the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull.\n\nThe Black Pearl has come to Port Royal.\n\n<b>INT.

Thank you,\n          Estrellia.\n\nThe maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins\nreading, toying absently with the medallion chain around\nher neck.\n\nThe lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn\nit up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.\n\n<b>INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT\n</b>\nWill, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron\ningot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.\n\nHis attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter\nand peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing,\n<b>\n</b>he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it\ndown; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.\n\n<b>INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT\n</b>\nCLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his\nmouth.\n\nThree seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their\ncell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a\nbone. The dog just sits and cocks its head.\n\n<b>                    PRISONER\n</b>          Come here, boy...

The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow\nbandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy?\n\nThe hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging\na flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind.

FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself\nout from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the\ngaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.\n\nBut it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's\ncell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.\n\n<b>                       PRISIONER\n</b>          Praise be!\n\nHe and the other two scramble through.\n\n<b>                    PRISONER (CONT'D)\n</b>              (back to Jack)\n          My sympathies, friend - - you've\n          no manner of luck at all!\n\nThe three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.\n\nJack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits\nshaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key\nring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks\nup the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog\nforward.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          It's all right, doggie ... come\n          here,\n\nboy.

Fido?\n\nTo his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.\nJack continues to coax him closer.\n<b>\n</b>The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the\ndog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He\nBRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.\n\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\n</b>          What's the matter, boy?\n\nThe dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out\nthrough the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.\n\nThe door to the cell block bursts open.

PORT ROYAL - NIGHT\n</b>\nAmid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through\nthe fog. Elizabeth sits in the prow. Columns of water from\ncannon balls geyser up around the boat.\n\nThe fog parts. Elizabeth looks up to see --\n\nThe Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming\nhigh above her. At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead\nof a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking\nwing from her outstretched hand.\n\nThe longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a\nwinch.\n\n<b>EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT\n</b>\nLit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. Smoke\nhangs heavy above the deck.\n\nElizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail --\npirates spot her, and stare. One polite fellow steps\n<b>\n</b>forward to offer his hand.

A cloud of\nSMOKE obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the\nstairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck-\n\nThis is BARBOSSA. Despite the bright colors of clothing,\ndefinitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley --\nor anywhere, for that matter.\n\nElizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from\nhis eyes. But she musters her courage -\n\n<b>                    ELIZABETH\n</b>          I am here to --\n\nThe Bosun SLAPS her.\n\n<b>                    BOSUN\n</b>          You'll speak when spoken to!\n\nHis wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa.\n\n<b>                    BARBOSSA\n</b>          And you'll not lay a hand on those\n          under the protection of parlay!\n\n<b>                       BOSUN\n</b>          Aye, sir.\n\nBarbossa releases him.

Back when Cortes was cutting a\n          great bloody swath through the New\n          World, a high priest gave. him all the\n          gold they had, with one condition: that\n          he spare the people's lives.

Opens it.\n\n<b>                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)\n</b>          So the priest, with his dying breath,\n          called on the power of the blood of his\n          people, and put on the gold a curse. If\n          anyone took so much as a single piece,\n          as he was compelled by greed, by greed\n          he would be consumed.\n\nInside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a\n\nfew pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribed\nwith Mayan glyphs.

Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.\n\n<b>                    GILLETTE (CONT'D)\n</b>          Jack and his crew have escaped!\n              (gasps from the crowd)\n          There was no damage to the cell ...\n          they must have been set free.\n\nWill and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No,\nnot me either! Swann notices something the parapet, points\n<b>-\n</b>\n<b>                    SWANN\n</b>          The Black Pearl!\n<b>\n</b>People rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bay\nare the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cuts\nthrough the waters very close to the point -\n\n-- where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jack\nappears, on the point; he swings off the one empty\ngallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it\npasses.\n\n<b>                    GILLETTE\n</b>          Sir!

That's all he gets.\n\nWill, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean-\n\n<b>EXT. BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAY\n</b>\nJack monkeys down the rigging.

It feels good -- right -- in his hands. He enjoys\nit, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode.\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!\n\n<b>                    ANAMARIA\n</b>          Aye, aye, sir!\n\n<b>                    JACK\n</b>          Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -\n          you and Cotton. I want every inch of\n          the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!\n\nGibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute.\n<b>\n</b>Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all\nis right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum:\n\"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ...\"\n\nHe realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes\nover as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ... and\nwe FADE UP large words in script:\n\n<b>                    THE END\n</b>          FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL\n<b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Pirates of the Caribbean</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ted Elliot\" title=\"Scripts by Ted Elliot\">Ted Elliot</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Terry Rossio\" title=\"Scripts by Terry Rossio\">Terry Rossio</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Pirates of the Caribbean Script.html#comments\" title=\"Pirates of the Caribbean comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:13:30.408900"}
