She is the irritant in the\n      household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of\n      Frank's marriage.\n\nJIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been\n      able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father\n      to Jim, but has never learned how.\n\nJIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the\n      husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her\n      mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless\n      man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on\n      her son.\n\nJIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is\n     filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because\n     of his \"nowhere\" father, he does not know how to be a\n     man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates\n     destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a\n     girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness.\n\n<b>                        JUDY'S FAMILY\n</b>\nJUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish,\n       attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by\n       the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only\n       recourse is to criticize her.\n\nJUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of\n       middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth\n       is threatening her wifely position as the desirable\n       object of the husband's attentions.\n\nJUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a\n      panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his\n      love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her\n      to invite the attention of other men in order to\n      punish him.\n\nBEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a\n      danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily--\n      certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable\n      in giving it.\n\nPLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a\n       traveling mother--he feels himself the target of\n       desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute\n       family for himself so that he need no longer feel\n       cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly\n       protection and warmth he needs and cannot find.\n\nBUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out\n      aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order\n      to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was\n      probably rejected by both parents and must constantly\n      court danger and must constantly court danger in order\n      to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth.\n\n<b>                          THE KIDS\n</b>\nHELEN, CRUNCH, MOOSE, GOON, CHICK, COOKIE, MIL: All\n       searching for recognition in the only way available\n       to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at\n       home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order\n       to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are\n       soldiers in search of an enemy.\n\n<b>FADE IN.\n</b>\nA deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly\nupward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is\nheard sounding the strokes of midnight.\n\nOn the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky\nWay and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of\nEaster singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude,\nunmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include:\n\nSpire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the\nsinging continues and we pass a window beyond which is the\nsource of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show--\n\nLong shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and\nsparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over:\n\nA lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes\nbut a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The\nheadlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same\nmelody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams\nthe door and starts down the street in the direction of a\nhouse with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full\nof rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two\nstreet lights.\n\nAs the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF\nFIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been\nlying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto\nthe pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their\nboots the whistling stops.\n\nThe MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking\nafter him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them\nto be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on\nmore swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He\nbegins to run toward the lighted house and the following\nsteps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street\nlight and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and\naround him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of\nthe boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled\nwith an awareness of his own masculinity.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>                   (friendly, cool)\n            That was pretty what you were\n            whistling.  Whistle some more.\n\nThe MAN whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of\nthe situation which he doesn't understand.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>                   (continuing; suddenly)\n            You got a cigarette?\n\n<b>                         MAN\n</b>            Oh, I think so--\n\nThe MAN fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in\nhis nervousness.  The FIGURES wait until he picks it up.  He\noffers one to BUZZ.\n\n<b>                         MAN\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            Filter tips.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>                   (smiling, encouraging)\n            You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad.\n\nSmiling uncertainly, the MAN puts the cigarette in his mouth.\nBUZZ, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            I'll light it for you, Dad.\n\nBUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a\nsecond, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under\nhis nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ\nslaps him sharply, his smile gone.\n\nThe camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds\non a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its\nwrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then\nruns down.\n\nThe feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey.\nThen camera rises to show that the man has disappeared.\nThere is a moment of awful stillness, then we see a boy\ncoming down the street alone.  He is quite drunk, and he\nslips once.  This is JIM, a good-looking kid of seventeen\nwith a crew-cut and wearing a good suit.  The spilled\npackages on the pavement stop him.  He bends down to see\nwhat they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the\nwreckage.  He smiles and winds it up.  He sets it on the\nsidewalk and sits down.  He watches it dance for a moment,\nhappily.  A siren is heard distantly, growing louder.  JIM\npays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and\nreleases it for its dance.\n\nSUPERIMPOSE TITLE: \"REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE\" STARRING ____ as\nsiren rises piercingly close, and JIM looks up, we:\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\nClose shot.  Throbbing light of police car.  Night.  The\nsiren screaming wildly, then dying.  The sound of brakes.\nCamera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the\nentrance of a Precinct Station.  Two officers dismount,\nbearing between them the struggling JIM.  They bear him up\nthe steps and in through the double doors.\n\nInside precinct station. Reception area.  A large open space\nonto which several corridors converge.  In the middle is a\nSergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center\nof which the SERGEANT stands.  There are a few glass-walked\ninterviewing rooms which open off the area, and several\nbenches lining the walls.  The scene is one of confusion,\nactivity and waiting.  Phones ring.  The arrested pass in\ncustody of officers.  Present among others at JIM's entrance\nare: JUDY, who is blonde and sixteen.  She sits on a crowded\nbench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness.  On a\nbench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty\nlittle Mexican children without shoes or socks.  The oldest\nis a BOY of four who is protecting his little SISTER who in\nturn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her.\nStanding at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy\nof fifteen named JOHN \"PLATO\" CRAWFORD.  He is shivering.\nWith him is a large NEGRO WOMAN, his maid.  JIM comes\nthrough the doors and is led to the desk.  One of the\nofficers presents a brief report to the SERGEANT, who\nexamines it.\n\n<b>                         SERGEANT\n</b>            Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth\n            Street?\n\n<b>                         OFFICER\n</b>            No.  Plain drunkenness.\n\n<b>                         SERGEANT\n</b>            This says he was picked up there.\n\n<b>                         OFFICER\n</b>            They had him on the carpet for an\n            hour at Headquarters.  He's clear.\n            Plain drunkenness.\n\n<b>                         SERGEANT\n</b>            Young squirt.  All right--You want\n            to lean him against something?\n            Stand him over there.\n\nThe officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against\nthe wall beside it.\n\nJIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The\nOFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take\nit, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back\nand moves away.  Another officer enters and leads the\nprisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room.  JIM\nsits beside her.  He smiles at her but receives only a\nchilling look.  He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing\non the floor, but she is not amused.  Camera pans to show\nothers reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO\nlook up and smile a little.  Camera stops on the MEXICAN\nCHILDREN who are smiling too.  A bald JUVENILE OFFICER named\nGENE, squats before them, smiling.\n\n<b>                         GENE\n</b>            You going to tell me your name now?\n\nThe little boy shakes his head.\n\n<b>                         LITTLE BOY\n</b>                   (touching GENE's bald pate)\n            Where's your hair?\n\n<b>                         GENE\n</b>            It's all gone.\n\n<b>                         LITTLE BOY\n</b>            Did you get a haircut?\n\n<b>                         GENE\n</b>            No--it just fell out!\n\n<b>                         LITTLE BOY\n</b>                   (sympathetically)\n            Aw--\n\nGENE laughs as another Juvenile Officer enters and pauses to\nlook at the children.  His name is RAY.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            What gang does he belong to?\n\n<b>                         GENE\n</b>            Give him a couple of years.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Where's your mamma, honey?\n\n<b>                         LITTLE BOY\n</b>            I don't know.\n\nRAY and GENE exchange looks, then RAY moves across to JUDY--\ncamera following.  He looks down at her, consults the file\nin his hand.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Judy--we're ready for you now.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>                   (a mumble)\n            He hates me.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            What?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            He hates me.\n\nShe rises.  RAY leads her to one of the glass-walled offices.\nCamera moves with them.  JIM watches them go.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            What makes you think he hates you,\n            Judy?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            I don't think.

He doesn't like my\n            friends--he--\n\nRAY leads her into the office.\n\nInside small office as JUDY comes in, RAY following.  He\nindicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            He doesn't like anything about me--\n            he calls me--he calls me--\n\nShe starts to cry.  She doesn't hide it, but keeps wiping\nthe tears with the palms of her hands.\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            He makes you feel pretty unhappy?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>                   (crying)\n            He calls me a dirty tramp--my own\n            father!\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Do you think your father means that?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe\n            he doesn't mean it but he acts like\n            he does.  We're altogether and\n            we're going to celebrate Easter and\n            catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So\n            I put on my new dress and I came\n            out and he--\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            That one?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Yes--he started yelling for a\n            handkerchief--screaming.  He\n            grabbed my face and he rubbed all\n            my lipstick off--he rubbed till I\n            thought I wouldn't have any lips\n            left.  And all the time yelling at\n            me--that thing--the thing I told\n            you he called me.  Then I ran out\n            of the house.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Is that why you were wandering\n            around at one o'clock in the morning?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            I was just talking a walk.  I tried\n            to call the kids but everybody was\n            out and I couldn't find them.  I\n            hate my life.  I just hate it.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            You weren't looking for company,\n            were you?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            No.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Did you stop to talk to anyone,\n            Judy?\n                   (she is silent)\n            Do you enjoy that?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            No.  I don't even know why I do it.\n\n<b>                         RAY\n</b>            Do you think you can get back at\n            your Dad that way?

RAY is heard dialing.\n\nMed. shot.  JIM's bench.  JIM sits with his head back, eyes\nclosed.  As the siren mounts louder, JIM opens his mouth and\nimitates it--a long, forlorn wail.\n\nMed. shot, PLATO and NEGRO WOMAN.  PLATO smiles faintly and\nmoves out toward JIM, NEGRO WOMAN following.

GRANDMA watches\neverything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little\nsounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy.  No one pays\nany attention to her.  For a moment no one talks.

JUDY looks\nto see that their attention isn't on her, then speaks\nquietly to PLATO.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Is he your friend?\n\n<b>                         PLATO\n</b>            Yes.

You have to get\n            to know him.  He doesn't say much\n            but when he does you know he means\n            it.  He's sincere.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Well, that's the main thing--don't\n            you think so?\n\n<b>                         PLATO\n</b>            Maybe next summer he's going to\n            take me hunting with him--and\n            fishing.  I want him to teach me\n            how and I bet he won't get mad if I\n            goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really\n            James but he likes Jim more.\n                   (laughing)\n            People he really likes--he lets\n            call him \"Jamie.\"\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Want to finish my hamburger?

BUZZ is beyond, at wheel of his.  Both boys are\ngunning their engines, listening critically.  JIM lets his\nidle.\n\nJUDY, GOON and group.  They watch in silent anticipation.\nPLATO starts away from them.\n\nTraveling shot.  PLATO hurrying away from the group.  He\nstops, looking off.\n\nJIM and BUZZ.  PLATO in distance.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            Better try the doors.  Jump out.\n\nJIM opens his door.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            No--quick, man!  You got to break\n            quick.\n\nJIM shuts his door and tries again.  So does BUZZ.  Then\nboth boys walk forward to the edge.  Neither says a word.\nBUZZ puts his hand on JIM's shoulder.\n\nHigh angle.  The edge of the bluff (process).  JIM and BUZZ\nare directly below us.  Under them the plateau falls steeply\naway in a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the ocean below.\n\nTwo shot.  JIM and BUZZ.  JIM is staring below.  He is\nbeginning to perspire.  He lights a cigarette.  Without\ntaking his hand from JIM's shoulder, BUZZ borrows the\ncigarette from his lips, takes a drag and hands it back.\nJIM takes another puff then tosses it into the abyss.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>                   (quietly)\n            This is the edge, boy.

JIM and BUZZ\nappear to him as two close friends.  Suddenly they break and\ngo, without speaking further, to their cars.  They back up\nto the opposite end of the plateau, headlights dark.  PLATO\nfollows them with his gaze.\n\nGroup shot.  GOON and others looking up as the cars glide by.\n\nMed. shot.  JUDY waiting as BUZZ and JIM move into starting\nposition next to her.  JUDY goes to BUZZ.  JIM is in b.g.--\nlooking on.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Feel okay?\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            Give me some dirt.\n\nShe bends out of sight for a moment as BUZZ goes on talking,\nthen hands him the dirt.  He rubs it into his palms.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We\n            head for the edge.  The first guy\n            who jumps--chicken!\n\nJUDY and BUZZ kiss, without much interest.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            What's happening?\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>            Good luck, Buzz.\n\nShe starts out, without kissing him again.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>                   (calling softly)\n            Judy.\n\nMed. shot.  JIM's car as JUDY comes to him.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>            Me too.\n\nShe looks at him a moment then bends and hands him some dirt.\nTheir heads touch for an instant.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>            Thank you.\n\nShe breaks the look and hurries away.\n\nLong shot.  The cars.  They are lined up in two rows--\nheadlights facing each other.  JUDY comes into shot.  When\nshe gets near camera, she stops and turns back to face them.\n\n<b>                         BUZZ\n</b>            Hit your lights!\n\nSuddenly the headlights of all the cars come on full.\n\nReverse shot.  JUDY.  She is in the center of the glare.\nBehind her we see the other kids filing out of their cars,\nhurrying toward the edge of the bluff.  The sound of the two\nmotors revving then dying and revving again.\n\nInside JIM's car.  JIM grips the wheel firmly, relaxes his\nhands to rub his palms together and crack his knuckles.  He\ngrips the wheel again.  Steps on the accelerator, winding\nhis engine into a roar.  He lets up, looks tensely at--\n\nBUZZ in his car.  His chin juts forward.  He lets go of the\nwheel, starts to comb his hair.\n\nSlow pan shot.  Spectators staring off at the cars.  A boy\nhas his arm around the girl in front of him, his cheek\nagainst hers.  Both are looking off.  Some of the kids smoke.\nAll are involved in the blasting of engines.\n\nPLATO among the spectators near edge of the bluff.  He is\nchewing his lip.  Camera pans down to show that the fingers\nof both his hands are tightly crossed.\n\nClose shot.  JUDY staring tensely into the glare.  Suddenly\nshe raises her hands high above her head.\n\nClose shot.  JIM sweating it out.  He leans forward,\nsquinting, ready.\n\nClose shot.  BUZZ.  He puts his comb between his teeth and\nclamps it hard.  He settles himself for the run.\n\nLong shot.  Plateau.  The cars are in close, seen from the\nrear.  JUDY is a small distant figure, arms stretched high.\nThe exhaust blasts.  Now she drops her arms.  The cars leap\nahead.\n\nMed. shot.  JUDY.  She whirls to see the cars snap by, then\nbegins running up the center of the plateau between the\nlines of spectators.\n\nFull shot.  Spectators.  Shooting over their shoulders as\nthe cars approach and scream past.\n\nPit shot.  Cars.  As they approach, gaining speed, and\nthunder over the camera.\n\nInside JIM's car. (Process).  He is tense.\n\nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  His hands hard on the wheel.\nThe comb is still between his teeth.  He begins edging\ntoward the door on his left.\n\nMoving close shot.  JUDY biting hard on her finger, as she\nruns forward.\n\nClose shot.  PLATO.  Both hands cover his mouth.  The\nfingers are still crossed.\n\nInside JIM's car. (Process).  As he edges to his left.  He\nis driving with one hand.  He opens the door, gets set for\nhis jump.\n\nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  He reaches for the door\nhandle and misses.  As he raises his arm to reach again, the\nstrap of his windbreaker sleeve slips over the handle.  He\nlooks down in panic, then back at the drop ahead.  He tugs\nbut cannot get the sleeve loose.\n\nCloseup.  PLATO staring.  He shuts his eyes tight and keeps\nthem shut.\n\nShooting at backs of the two cars as they race through the\nrow of lights toward the edge.\n\nInside JIM's car. (Process).  His face is soaked.  He looks\nonce toward BUZZ--then ahead.  His eyes widen in fear.  He\nshoves left and flings himself forward, and out.\n\nOutside JIM's car as he sprawls forward--into camera.\n\nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  BUZZ leans way forward now.\nHe seems to rise in his seat.  His mouth opens and the comb\nfalls out.\n\nFull shot spectators staring in disbelief.  Suddenly a youth\nducks his face into the neck of his girlfriend so he cannot\nsee.  At the same instant--\n\n<b>                         CROWD\n</b>                   (in a single breath)\n            Oh!\n\nRear view.  Edge of the bluff as the two cars go over.\nThere is NO human sound.\n\nClose shot.  JIM as he stops rolling.\n\nBUZZ's car in flight. (Special effects).  The car soars\nthrough the night, the vehicle of a terrible journey.\n\nMed. shot.  BUZZ. (Process).  Surprise has gone.  He rides\nlightly on the thrill of his last moment--then suddenly, his\nface twists in a spasm of protest and loss.\n\nThe kids staring at his flight.\n\nJIM unaware of the disaster--glad he made it.\n\nLow angle.  Edge of the bluff.  With headlights blazing,\nboth cars dive down.\n\nMed. shot.  JUDY standing frozen as the spectators shove\npast and around her.\n\nWide angle.  Edge of the bluff as spectators swarm to it,\nstand looking down.\n\nJIM on hands and knees, trying to rise.  Legs rush by him,\nknock him onto his face.\n\nLong shot. (Special effects).  Both cars plunge into the\nocean below.\n\nJIM at edge of bluff.  He is pushing through spectators.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>                   (a harsh whisper)\n            Where's Buzz!

CRUNCH looks up as he hears JIM's repeated cry.\nJIM enters behind him, continuing blindly on his way.\n\n<b>                         CRUNCH\n</b>                   (tight fury)\n            Down there!  Down there is Buzz!\n\nJIM looks over the edge.\n\nRear view.  Spectators.  A siren wail approaches.  The kids\nwheel and scatter, panicking past the camera.\n\nClose shot.  MOOSE.  Looks at JIM.  Runs.\n\nClose shot.  GOON.  Turns.  Runs.\n\nMed. shot.  JIM seen between legs of hurrying kids.  The\nsirens and the pounding of their feet on the hard turf.  JIM\nis sitting on the edge of the bluff.  PLATO rushes in, stops\nshort as he sees him.\n\n<b>                         PLATO\n</b>            Come on, Jim!

She is standing alone in the wind on the\nemptying plateau.  JIM and PLATO move past in the distance.\nJIM sees her and stops.\n\nClose shot.  JUDY.  She is shuddering violently but there\nare no tears.  She seems not to see or hear or be aware of\nanything around her.\n\nFull shot.  JIM and PLATO watching JUDY.  JIM moves toward\nher, camera panning with him and leaving PLATO behind.  JIM\nstands before JUDY until she notices him.  He shakes his\nhead for all the sorrow he feels, but no words come.\nTentatively he offers her his hand.  After a moment, she\ntakes it.  She knows only that help is being offered and\nthat she will accept it with trust.  JIM leads her away\ntoward the car.\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\nHigh long shot.  JIM's street.  Night.  There is no movement\nanywhere.  In the house bordering the street a few lights\nstill burn.  JIM's car approaches out of distance and slows\nwhen it reaches the alley.\n\nMed. shot.  JIM's car as it slows and stops.  JIM, JUDY and\nPLATO in the front seat.  JUDY has the door open before the\ncar even stops.  She is shaking, agitated and withdrawn.\n\n<b>                         JUDY\n</b>                   (hardly audible)\n            This is fine--\n\nShe gets out and starts away, leaving door open.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>                   (calling quietly)\n            Judy.  Will you be okay?\n\nPLATO looks at him.  JUDY hesitates.  JIM raises a hand to\nher in a shy farewell.  She smiles vaguely, then hurries\naway from them.\n\nNear JIM's backyard (alley).  JIM and PLATO.\n\n<b>                         JIM\n</b>            I got to go in.

JIM goes\ninto his kitchen door.\n\nHallway.  JUDY's house.  Three doors open onto it: one is\nclosed--this is JUDY's room:--another, leading into BEAU's\nroom is open, but the room beyond is dark: the third, also\nopen, reveals the bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY comes\ninto the hallway, the parents, who are reading in their\nbeds, look up.  JUDY hesitates, then starts toward her own\nroom.\n\n<b>                         BEAU (O.S.)\n</b>                   (quietly)\n            Hello, little cute sister.\n\nJUDY stops.  BEAU appears at his door in white pajamas, a\nsmall ghost.  JUDY looks at him.\n\n<b>                         BEAU\n</b>            Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor-\n            puss, sweetie--\n\nJUDY touches BEAU's head and tries to smile.\n\n<b>                         JUDY'S FATHER\n</b>                   (calling from his bed)\n            Beau!  You belong in bed!\n\nBEAU flees.  JUDY turns without another glance at her\nparents, and opens the door of her room.\n\nInside bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY slams her bedroom\ndoor o.s., the FATHER reacts.  Perhaps, he wishes she had\ngiven him a chance to say goodnight.  The MOTHER, who use\nreading glasses, looks up at the slam.  Then she looks over\nat her husband, shrugs when she catches his gaze, and goes\nback to her magazine.\n\nInside JIM's living room.  The television is on, but only a\nhum comes from it, and the screen is a flickering gray.  The\nFATHER sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace, still\ndressed but with his collar open.  The sound of JIM's step\nin the dining room makes him open his eyes.  Fear of facing\nhis son makes him shut them again.  The boy comes in, a\nbottle of milk in his hand.  Seeing his FATHER there, he\nstops short--his impulse is to flee.  Instead he comes in\nand looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids, fluttering\nin the FATHER's masquerade of sleep, make him seem to be\nhaving a dream.  JIM is torn between his desire to leave and\nhis need to speak.  He turns off the television quietly,\nthen lies down on the couch across the way.  He mumbles the\nthings he would say to his FATHER and the answers he feels\nhe would get.  The old man opens his eyes once, sees the boy\nthere, head banging upside down from the couch.  Then he\nshuts them again.\n\nUpside down long shot.  Room (JIM's viewpoint).  Suddenly,\ninverted in his vision, the MOTHER appears at the head of\nthe stairs, in bathrobe and nightgown.  She pauses a moment,\nthen runs down crying:\n\n<b>                         MOTHER\n</b>            He's home!  You're home!  You're\n            all right!\n\nThe camera rights itself suddenly.\n\nJIM as he completes his turn, pulling his head up and sitting.\n\nFATHER as he pretends to awaken with a start.\n\nFull shot, room as the MOTHER hurries to JIM, holds him,\ninspects him, kisses him.\n\n<b>                         MOTHER\n</b>            What happened, darling.

A Mediterranean villa with a\nlarge domed solarium which is connected to the main building\nby a low enclosed arcade.  A crash and the falling of\nsplintered glass is heard.\n\nLong shot.

JIM shrugs--tests to see if the boy is\nawake, but there is no reaction.\n\nCarefully, they crawl to their feet.  JIM supporting PLATO's\nhead with his hands as they do so.  JIM takes the other\nblanket and covers PLATO with it.  JUDY kneels on the other\nside and tucks it in.  They look at each other across him\nand smile.  Then suddenly JUDY bends down and kisses PLATO's\ncheek very softly.  JUDY and JIM rise.\nJIM takes a candle from the candelabra and leads JUDY along\nthe edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond.  Silence\nexcept for their footfalls on the flagstone.  In the\ndistance we see the doors open and the couple pass through.\nWhen they close again, a sob comes from PLATO.\n\nHigh angle closeup.  PLATO lying as they left him, but his\neyes are open and he is crying.  Camera booms up as PLATO\nthrows off the blanket and looks after them.  Camera booms\nhigher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure\nsitting by himself.  The pool echoes his weeping.\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\nInside library.  Mansion.  Night.  The door opens slowly and\nJIM appears with the candle.

Take the steps!  Goon!  The\n            other side.\n\nThe boys run to their assigned places.  PLATO sees no exit.\nHe flings himself down the ladder and into the pool.  He\nfeints this way and that, the boys responding as if they\nwere fencing.  CRUNCH swings down the ladder and his boots\nmake a loud report as they hit the pool.  MOOSE advances\ndown the steps at the shallow end.  GOON climbs onto the\npool bottom at the opposite side.  The feinting continues,\nwordlessly, as the circle closes around PLATO.  The only\nsounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to\ndistract him from side to side, and the animalistic grunts\nthey make to scare him.  Suddenly PLATO sees an opening and\nplunges past MOOSE, pushing him over, and stumbles up the\nsteps.\n\n<b>                         CRUNCH\n</b>            Come on!  Let's make it!\n\nThey stream out of the pool after PLATO.  He reaches the\nglass doors first, streaks though, and bangs them shut\nbehind him.\n\nTraveling shot.  Arcade.  PLATO's face is visible only when\nthe moonlight strikes him through the passing windows.  The\nsound of running steps behind him.\n\nFull shot.  Main room.  A pattern of moonlight on the bare\nfloor as PLATO dashes in and through it.  He falls over a\npiece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera, wheels\naround on hands and knees to face the door.  The boys plunge\ninto the moonlit square and stop.  PLATO tries not to\nbreathe.  A match is struck.  CRUNCH looks around, but can\nsee nothing.  That match goes out.  The boys start up the\nstairs, whispering.  Immediately, PLATO crawls forward,\nunder the piano.  He hears a murmur of voices from behind\nthe oak door of the library--next to the piano.  He moves to\nit stealthily.\n\nClose shot, PLATO at door listening through it, on hands and\nknees.  His confusion mounts.  He shakes his head to clear\nit.  Then, suddenly he rises and tries the knob.  The door\nis locked.  He beats on it.\n\n<b>                         PLATO\n</b>            Save me!\n\nThe boys run across the room.  As they hit the moonlit\nsquare.  PLATO spins and fires.  Somebody drops and starts\nmoaning.  JIM opens the door.\n\n<b>                         PLATO\n</b>                   (shrieks)\n            What you run out on me for!
