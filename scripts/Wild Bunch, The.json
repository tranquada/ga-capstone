He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...\n          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early\n          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant\n          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes\n          in himself and those around him.\n          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are\n          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a\n          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for\n          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside\n          and against society because he believes in that way of life\n          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of\n          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'\n          according to the righteous...

He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,\n          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.\n          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,\n          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot\n          tempered and sudden.

This is. AL'GEL.\n          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle\n          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty\n          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with\n          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them\n          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent\n          dignity of. man (some men at least). \" He is faster than his\n          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.\n          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --\n          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.\n          he will have no regrets.\n          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP.
