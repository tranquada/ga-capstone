In CLOSE F.G. is.the back\n          part of a sign.\n\n          NARRATOR\n          To most of America in 1913, the Age\n          of Innocence had arrived and the\n          stories of the Indian Wars and the\n          Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters\n          had become either barroom ballyhoo\n          or front-porch remiraiscences... .But\n          on both sides of the $io Grande men\n           still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's\n          and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a\n          changing land.\n          THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..\n          The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are\n          regulation.\n          PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead\n          of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...\n          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early\n          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant\n          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes\n          in himself and those around him.\n          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are\n          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a\n          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for\n          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside\n          and against society because he believes in that way of life\n          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of\n          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'\n          according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,\n          and he wouldn't have it any other way.\n          Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.\n          Dutch is big\u00e2\u0080\u009e good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong\n          loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and\n          regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,\n          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.\n          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,\n          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot\n          tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and\n\n          CONTINUED\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          2 CONTINUED\n          sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,\n          vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing\n          for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.\n          They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each\n          other and that is limited.\n          A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.\n          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle\n          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty\n          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with\n          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them\n          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent\n          dignity of. man (some men at least). \" He is faster than his\n          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.\n          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --\n          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.\n          he will have no regrets.\n          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP.
