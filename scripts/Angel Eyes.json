CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE.\n\nAs OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime\npulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting\nlike blood through the veins of a body --\nimpressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing\nis soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the\nmodern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,\nputting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nPOV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT\n\nNow the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision\nblurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We\nhear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,\nbut MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.\nWe come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside\nsomeone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on\nthe edge of consciousness and not far from death. He\nlies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an\naccident only minutes after impact.\n\nHis VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are\nswarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of\nwrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and\napproaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back\ntoward consciousness, slips again.\n\nThe crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to\na police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,\nLAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,\nspeaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her\nface clearly now, close above him.\n\nSharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down\ninto her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our\neyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there\nare more   SIRENS converging in b.g.\n\n                          SHARON\n            Can you hear me?\n                   (shouting, off)\n            This one's conscious!\n\n                          VOICE (O.S.)\n            Paramedics on the way!\n\nWe are slipping away again.

Wait. Listen to me.    Can\n             you feel that?\n\nShe holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her\nown, is bloody.\n\n                           SHARON\n             That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on\n             -- as hard as you can.\n\nWe watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the\nsights and sounds around us grow more clear.\n\n                           SHARON\n             It's over, and I've got you, and\n             you're safe. You're safe now.\n             You got that? Don't let go.\n             Don't let me go.\n\nBut our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of\nnight sky. Her voice fades awawy.

LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY\n\nWe PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.\nThe beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with\nsome very rough edges.\n\n\nINT. POLICE CAR - DAY\n\nOfficer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years\nsince we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,\nROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD\nmonitor which lists all area police calls. She slows\nbehind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,\ndriven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the\nbench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.\n\n                           SHARON\n             That car is older than they are.\n\n                           ROBBY\n             '67 Chevy Impala.\n\n                           SHARON\n             That's what I said.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       3.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           ROBBY\n             Needs a servicing.\n\n                             SHARON\n             Don't we all.\n\nRobby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon\nhas said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking\nher head.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Get it together, officer.\n\nAs Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple\nwho each have an arm around the other. She is stroking\nhis neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.\nSharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a\ndepth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her\nthoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and\nstartling the people ahead who now disengage and drive\non.\n\n                            ROBBY\n             Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my\n             coffee again! You didn't like his\n             hair, or what?\n\n                        SHARON\n          I love Elvis hair. They were\n          going two damn miles an hour.\n\nBut Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.\n\n                        ROBBY\n          Let's roll to this -- fight in\n          progress.\n\nAs Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN\nand speeds around the car in front of them.\n\n\nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY\n\nAt the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is\ncarrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for\nhim.\n\nWalking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH\nLAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his\nface. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but\nthere is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed\nand stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up\nhis pace to catch up to the old man.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     4.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nPeople glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open\nand unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,\nor -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a\nthreatening or taunting look. These he also meets\nopenly, without a trace of fear. The man has been\nthrough some kind of fire, and it has left him different\nfrom us. Outside the usual boundaries.\n\nCatch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.\nFinally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,\nbut Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.\n\n                           CATCH\n             Y'know... since we're both walking\n             the same way, I could take one of\n             those bags for you. That way, I\n             do some upper body work while I'm\n             walking along. Helps my back.\n             What d'you say?\n\nThe Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.\n\n                           CATCH\n             Right now your mind's making\n             pictures of me robbing your\n             groceires, but, y'know, nine times\n             out of ten, people do the right\n             thing.\n\nThe Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he\nsoon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old\nman looks at him, a bit embarrassed.\n\n                           OLD MAN\n             It's the dog food that makes it so\n             heavy.\n\nCatch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,\nthen decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.\n\n                           CATCH\n             I guess it's worth it... for a\n             good dog.\n\nCatch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man\nnods and starts trudging again. As they walk on\ntogether, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man\nrelents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch\ncarrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a\nbit for his upper body work.\n\n                                                          5.\n\nEXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY\n\nThis is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a\nchaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight\nboys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off\nanother by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and\nresisting and Sharon shows her toughness and\nprofessionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him\ninto a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the\nyoung man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.\n\n                        KID\n          Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,\n          look at this!\n\nSharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking\nthis Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.\nA crowd watches -- mostly teens.\n\n                        KID\n                 (to Sharon)\n          You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.\n\nSome of his bystanders friends howl at that.\n\n                        KID\n          You're going to arrest me, you\n          come into the back seat with me.\n          Come on!\n\nHe resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.\n\n                         KID\n          Come on.   We'll have a good time.\n\n\nINT. POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)\n\nSharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the\nKid keeps mouthing off.\n\n                        SHARON\n                 (to radio)\n          Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to\n          the jail with one male prisoner.\n\n                        KID\n          Take off your uniform. Take off\n          my handcuffs, bitch, and come back\n          here. I want one touch.\n\n                        ROBBY\n          Give it a rest!\n\nSharon is stone-faced through this.\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           6.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           KID\n             If you're going to put me away,\n             you gotta give me one sweet touch.\n\n\nINT. JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY\n\nAs Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking\ncounter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is\nlooking at Sharon's hand on his arm.\n\n                           KID\n             That ain't the touch.   That ain't\n             the touch I want.\n\nThey get him to the counter.\n\n                           ROBBY\n             As I remove your cuffs, I want you\n             to put your hands here. Spread\n             your legs. More.\n\nAs they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move\ntoward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was\nnot only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the\nstoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she\nmoves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his\nface into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down\non his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes\nover to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.\n\n                            ROBBY\n             That's it.   Back off, John, we got\n             it.\n\nRobby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.\n\n\nEXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)\n\nas Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are\ninterrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,\nwalking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She\nmeets his look.\n\n                           SANDERMAN\n             You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?\n\nShe is straightforward, not rebellious.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I just dealt with the situation.\n             The prisoner...\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          7.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                            SANDERMAN\n             And you don't see a pattern here?\n                    (pause)\n             I want you to keep yourself way\n             inside the line instead of walking\n             on it. All right? Are you taking\n             notes?\n\nHe walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their\ncar -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.\n\n                           ROBBY\n             You broke his nose.\n\n                              SHARON\n             He grabbed me.     End of story.\n\n                           ROBBY\n             And you were waiting for him. You\n             were hoping. You were making\n             long-range plans for his ass while\n             he was mouthing off in the car --\n             and you're supposed to be above\n             that shit.\n\n                           SHARON\n             If you think I crossed the line,\n             put it in the report.\n\n                           ROBBY\n             Pogo, stop the shit.

You're a rare\n          unthreatened male cop with a good\n          marriage, and you like to eat\n          where I eat -- so everything's\n          code four.\n\nShe STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches\nover and turns OFF the IGNITION.

He picks it up out of the gurgling\nrain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.\nHe puts it in his pocket, walks on.\n\nNow the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-\nTHUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along\nslowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.\nThere are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for\ntrouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,\nwalks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He\nstops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,\nshouting over the music.\n\n                          CATCH\n             Hey! You want to turn that volume\n             down?

One\nof the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.\n\n                            MAN #2\n             Guy's nuts.   Let's go.\n\nThe Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the\nDEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring\nat Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.\n\n                                                       10.\n\nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT\n\nCatch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a\nslightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the\ncorridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's\ndoor and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.\nHe pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.\n\nSomeone looks through the peephole and then opens the\ndoor -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little\ncaution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a\nlittle boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her\nson is TOMMY.\n\n                         CANDACE\n          Hi.\n\n                         CATCH\n          Hi.   Your keys are in the...\n\nHe gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,\nmore friendly now.\n\n                        CANDACE\n          Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.\n          God. I was trying to carry Tommy\n          and all these bags. He was so\n          tired. Of course, as soon as I\n          put him down he had all this\n          energy...\n\nWhile she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,\nwho is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,\ngoes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs\nthat layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to\nthe mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as\nhe is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution\nto say...\n\n                        CANDACE\n          Y'know, we were just baking\n          nectarine bars because the peaches\n          weren't ripe. Ever had a\n          nectarine bar?\n\nHe smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already\nretreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no\nfurther.\n\n                         CATCH\n          Sorry.   Gotta be going.\n\nAnd with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his\napartment, unlocks it and steps in.\n\n                                                      11.\n\nINT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nHe walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,\nlamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,\nnever-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a\ndrawer.\n\nIn the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,\nsome purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of\nopening the door has started some battery-operated\nanimals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he\ntakes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in\nand closes the drawer.\n\nHe walks back into the living room. He sits on the\nfloor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still\nsoaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking\na bit numb -- and lost.\n\n\nEXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY\n\nSharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger\nin a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where\nalterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman\nis just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at\nSharon, a real talker.\n\n                         MRS.

Mrs. Vander\nis walking to the counter and pausing to say...\n\n                           MRS.   VANDER\n             You know Dan and I   renewed our\n             vows last year.

VANDER\n             Your mom and dad -- the\n             ceremony...\n\nMrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,\nsympathetic and embarrassed.\n\n                           MRS. VANDER\n             Oh, well... y'know, I just got\n             that invitation a few... just now,\n             so I'm sure you'll...\n\n                           SHARON\n             Oh, yeah. We've had... there's\n             been some problems with the mail\n             in our building, so... I'll\n             probably get it today.\n\nThey're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's\nbeen left out.\n\n                           SHARON\n             So, I guess I'll see you.\n\n                           MRS. VANDER\n          Sure, honey.     I'll see you there.\n\nSharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling\nbad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,\nreplaced by an old pain and darkness.\n\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY\n\nRobby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with\na sign marked \"POGUE CONSTRUCTION.\" Sharon exits the car\nand walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both\ncarpenter and supervisor on the job.

CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY)\n\nWe WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park\nand PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing\nbounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis\npractice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a\nlunge and snags the ball.

Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this\nrapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,\nplaying hard and mugging and making them smile until... a\nPOLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a\nbit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.\nCatch glances up and sees...\n\n\nCATCH'S POV\n\nSharon is in the car beside Robby.\n\n\nON CATCH\n\nStunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.\nHe can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her.

The man is aiming at her and about to fire\nwhen he is tackled by Catch.\n\nCatch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of\nthe man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,\npointing her gun at him...\n\n                             SHARON\n             Freeze!    Right there!\n\nCatch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts\nhis knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at\nCatch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.\n\n                              ROBBY\n             Hey!

Ray Juliette and Sanchez move\ntoward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon\nand the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and\nSharon glance at each other, during...\n\n\nON CATCH\n\nas the cops reach him.\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       20.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           RAY\n             What happened here?\n\n                           CATCH\n             I... just saw it and...

Y'know.\n\nShe glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him\nfrom the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then\ntheir attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks\nto her sergeant.\n\n                             SHARON\n             He had me.    I was dead.\n\n\nON CATCH\n\nHe is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks\nhis I.D.\n\n                           CATCH\n             I was just walking by.

UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)\n\nCatch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is\ncarrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-\nkept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the\ncovered portico.\n\n\nINT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY\n\nELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and\nintelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a\nwriting table where she carefully translates an English\ntext into Chinese characters.\n\nShe glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads\nfor the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her\nor into the living room at all.\n\n                        CATCH\n          I got you nectarines because the\n          peaches are hard as rocks.\n\n                        ELANORA\n          Your jacket's all dirty.\n\nShe rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --\nand as they speak across the house, she performs a\nritual...\n\n                        CATCH (O.S.)\n          I tackled a guy.\n\nElanora is moving about the living room, picking up\nframed photographs and turning them face down. We don't\nsee what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning\nthem all in a routine way, used to this.\n\n                        ELANORA\n          Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!\n\n                        CATCH (O.S.)\n          Why do you think?\n\n\nINT.

He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see\nsome nervousness in him as he says...\n\n                           CATCH\n             Met somebody today.\n\nMrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the\nbags to help.\n\n                           ELANORA\n             Oh?

We see\nher own depth of feeling.\n\n                           ELANORA\n             Well... that's a good thing.\n\nHe is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,\nhis struggle.\n\n                           CATCH\n             I saw her once a long time ago.\n\nElanora stares a moment.      This has meaning for her.\n\n                            ELANORA\n             Where?\n\nHe doesn't answer.      He's nervous about this.\n\n                           CATCH\n             She looks the same.\n\nNow she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and\ncontinues his work in silence.\n\n\nINT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT\n\nIt's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO\na booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including\nRay, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.\nThey're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.\nThey are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at\nit and says...\n\n                            COP\n             Beautiful.\n\n... And Sanchez says proudly.\n\n                            SANCHEZ\n             Yeah.

Rex is good.

They are standing close together.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Maybe going is a good idea.\n\n                           CATCH\n             Can I come back some time?\n\n                             SHARON\n             Why?\n\n                           CATCH\n                    (shrugs)\n             Must be the smell.\n\nThat makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with\nher surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the\nback of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is\ngoing in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a\nmoment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and\nlets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and\npassionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks\noff and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is\nstaring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,\ngetting the words out just above a whisper.\n\n                             CATCH\n             I better go.\n\nShe doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He\nleaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,\nand she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She\nlost control. With a stranger.\n\n                             SHARON\n             Oh, God.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nCatch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,\nstaring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the\npath of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the\nscream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps\nparalyze Catch, and he sees --\n\n                                                         37.\n\nFLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE\n\nHeadlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)\n\nThis sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one\ncomes.\n\n\nFLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS\n\ncoming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,\nand all of this is exploded --\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)\n\nby the angry DRIVER shouting at him.\n\n\n                        DRIVER\n          What the hell do you think you're\n          doing?!\n\nCatch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle\nof the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward\nhim, raging.\n\n                        DRIVER\n          Are you crazy?!\n\nCatch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --\nand now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are\nwet.\n\n\nANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT\n\nAs Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --\nbut when he passes a parked car with the window half\nopen, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk\non. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the\ndoor, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.\n\nBut a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and\ncalls out...\n\n                           MAN\n          Hey!    Hey!   What did you do?\n\nCatch stops and turns in the rain.

Hah?!\n\nHe shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion\nexplodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's\njacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly\nslap, slap, slapping him, saying...\n\n                              CATCH\n             Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!\n\nThe Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's\neyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.\n\n                              CATCH\n             I helped you.\n                    (pause)\n             I helped you.\n\nCatch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,\nhunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.\nHe gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --\nbut Catch only says...\n\n                              CATCH\n             I'm sorry.\n\nAnd he walks on.        The Man watches him go.\n\n\nINT.

He frees the elevator; they step\ninside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face\n\"follows\" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.\nWe hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries\nhis new possessions to his apartment.\n\n\nEXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY\n\nA well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of\nnearly 60 is tending the flowers.

There is an\nold strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness\nin Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her\ndaughter as Sharon comes through the gate.

He comes out\nof the office and moves to where Sharon is typing.\n\n                              SANDERMAN\n             Sharon...\n\n                           SHARON\n                    (typing)\n             Lieutenant...\n\nWe can see the   computer screen now. Sharon is searching\nfor any prior   record of \"Catch Lambert\" -- arrests,\nconvictions.    She has several \"Carl Lamberts\" on the\nscreen, even a   \"Casper,\" no Catch.\n\n                           SANDERMAN\n             Anything bothering you?\n\n                            SHARON\n             Why?   What'd I do?\n\n                           SANDERMAN\n             Nothing. I'm talking about your\n             general attitude lately.\n\nSharon stops typing.     She can find nothing.    She clears\nthe screen, sighs.\n\n                           SHARON\n             My attitude's fine. End of a long\n             day.

He went out on a\n             violent domestic dispute\n             yesterday. A neighbor called it\n             in. It got a little ugly. No\n             arrest -- a warning.\n\nThis hits her hard.\n\n                              SHARON\n             Larry.     Oh Christ.\n\n                           SANDERMAN\n             Nester said it's not the first\n             time.\n\nSharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Thanks for telling me.\n\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET (CULVER CITY) - DAY (NEXT MORNING)\n\nSharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It\nhas a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire-\nswing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL.\nShe hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick\nmurmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words.\nIn a moment, Larry opens the door.\n\n                           LARRY\n             Jesus, you're up early.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I wanted to catch you before you\n             went to work.\n\n                           LARRY\n             I thought you were on late shifts.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I don't sleep much.

A TV can be heard -- CARTOONS.\n\n                          LARRY\n          What's up?\n\n                          SHARON\n          Where's Kath?\n\n                        LARRY\n          She's busy with Larry Jr. right\n          now.\n\nSharon nods, but then walks past him.\n\n\nINT. CHILD'S ROOM - DAY\n\nAs Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room. Larry Jr. is\nsitting on the floor, watching a small TV. Kathy is not\nwith him. Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment.\n\n                          SHARON\n          Hey, Champ.\n\nBut he stays focused on the TV, some darkness, some\nunsayable worry in his eyes. She picks up a toy car,\nspeaks softly.\n\n                        SHARON\n          Y'know, they call this one a woody\n          'cause it has wood on the sides.\n\n                          LARRY JR.\n          I know.\n\nNow he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes. She is\nhurting for him. Larry is now in the doorway. Sharon\nkisses the child's head and walks out, passing her\nbrother.\n\n                        LARRY\n          Why'd you come by?\n\n                          SHARON\n          To see Kathy.\n\n\nINT.

BEDROOM - DAY\n\nSharon walks in. Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face\nbadly bruised. They stare. Kathy speaks quietly, her\neyes filling.\n\n                           KATHY\n             Don't make it worse.\n\n                              SHARON\n             It gets worse?\n\n                           KATHY\n             He's okay now. He's torn up about\n             it. Don't make him mad.\n\nSharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with\na comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face\naway.\n\n                            SHARON\n             When Larry and I were growing up,\n             our mother said that all the time.\n             'Don't make your father mad.'\n                    (pause)\n             Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?\n\n                           KATHY\n             He never would.\n\n                            SHARON\n             Oh.   Just you, huh?\n\nLarry is in the doorway now, angry.\n\n                           LARRY\n             What d'you think you're doing in\n             my house, Shar? In my home.\n\nShe walks out of the room and he follows her.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nShe turns on him.\n\n                            SHARON\n             You see a pattern here, bro?\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         58.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           LARRY\n             I lost my temper.

Like it's an excuse.\n\n                        LARRY\n          I don't need a goddamn lecture.\n\nShe comes very close to him.\n\n                       SHARON\n         You want to hit someone?       Next\n         time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar,\n         and you just have to hit      somebody,\n         you go home and hit your      father.\n\n                       LARRY\n         You blame everything on him.\n\n                       SHARON\n         I'm blaming you, you fucking\n         coward.\n\nHe grabs her shirt hard.\n\n                        LARRY\n          You don't come in here...\n\nHe pushes her into the wall.\n\n                        LARRY\n          You don't come in here and call me\n          names.\n\n                         SHARON\n          What do you call a man who uses\n          his wife as a punching bag?\n                  (pause)\n          Coward.\n\nHe swings a slap at her.

The little boy\ncomes out of his room. There is a surprised moment.\nThen Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his\nroom. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.\nSharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I know how it feels, 'cause I\n             remember.

SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe is just returning home after her shift, very tired,\ndrained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She\nnotices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits\nthe button.\n\n                           LARRY (V.O.)\n             I bet you feel real proud of\n             yourself, Shar, knocking me down\n             in front of my family. You know\n             what I've got in my hand? I've\n             got a Polaroid picture of my\n             busted-up face, and I'm thinking\n             of sending it to your department,\n             to your lieutenant. I'm going to\n             turn you in to the police, Shar,\n             and see how you like it.\n\nThe message ends.     She stands there a moment.\n\n                           SHARON\n                    (quietly)\n             Oh, God. Oh, shit.\n\nShe sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her\nthoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.\nIn a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a\ndrawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number\non it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates,\nthen starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door\nmakes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows.\nShe walks to the door.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           60.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           SHARON\n             It's you, right?\n\nShe unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very\nvulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over\nLarry just   under the surface. Catch holds a box of\ncookies as   an offering.\n\n                            SHARON\n             Can you just shut up?    Just shut\n             up and listen.\n\n                           CATCH\n             I didn't say anything.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I don't want to talk. I don't\n             care if you have to play some game\n             and pretend you're a... 'angel of\n             mercy' or... whatever. I don't\n             care, but I don't want to hear\n             about it. All right? I don't\n             want to hear anything.\n\nShe steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and\nturns to him.\n\n                           SHARON\n             It's a bad night.\n\nHe sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes\nthrough his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head\non his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on\nhim goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and\nlonging, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit.\nShe sighs. In a moment...\n\n                           SHARON\n             This is good... but I'm too tired\n             to stand up anymore.\n\nHe walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then\nslowly, gently, he \"disarms\" her. He lifts her leg,\ntakes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the\ntable. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from\nthe middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket\nand removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her\nI.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their\nfaces close, eyes locked. They linger...\n\n                           SHARON\n             You want to kiss me?\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       61.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nHe looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes\ntoward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch,\nshe says, softly...\n\n                           SHARON\n             Kiss me someplace I've never been\n             kissed.\n\nHe's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over --\nas if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts\nslowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her\nshirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he\nstarts to move there, but checks her with a look. She\nshakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He\ntakes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft\nflesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her\neyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and\nthen he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside\nof her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her\nknees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them\nto... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft\nvoice.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Why do you stop? You always stop.\n\nShe has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the\ndeep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes\na moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on\nhis lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the\npillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her\neyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET\nMUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a\nwhile, and then --\n\n                                           SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING\n\nJust after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is\nbeginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the\nwindows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes\nclear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly\nshaken by --\n\n\nFLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV\n\n-- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving.\nWe see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the\nside and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside\nhim, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She\nis saying something to him. We don't hear the words.\nWhen the FLASHBACK ENDS --\n\n                                                        62.\n\nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)\n\nCatch sits up on the couch, jolted.   He gets another\nsudden --\n\n\nFLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS\n\nglaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps,\nsitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He\nstands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nSharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with\ntroubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look.\nHe bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him.\nHe wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and\nvery gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it\nagain. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He\nsmiles at her.\n\n                          CATCH\n          New day.\n\n\nEXT. BOULEVARD - DAY\n\nSharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main\nboulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a\nlight. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from\nthe pedestrians crossing the street.\n\n                          PINDELLA (O.S.)\n          Catch?\n\nThey look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the\nmiddle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his\nforties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD\nPINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch.\nSharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the\nman a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him,\nnervous, intense.\n\n                          PINDELLA\n          Catch?\n\n                        CATCH\n                 (to Sharon)\n          Drive, will you?\n\nPindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him,\nwondering.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         63.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                             CATCH\n             Drive!\n\nThe light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the\ncars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the\nmirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the\noffice building on the corner.\n\n                        CATCH\n          Will you get off this street?\n\nShe makes a turn, glancing at Catch.\n\n                             SHARON\n          What?

Walk with me.\n\nShe hesitates,    then falls in   beside him as he walks on.\nThey walk along    in silence,   the neighborhood growing more\nseedy, tougher    as they go.

Now Catch is pausing as a woman\nis walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car.\n\nCatch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy\nwave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the\ngirl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks\nback at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger\ntrick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl\ngiggles But the Mother is impatient.\n\n                              MOM\n             Go on.\n\nThe girl gets in.

Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the\nalley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --\nwhom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a\nmountain scene.

Catch is on the couch, stirring in his\nsleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what\nhe hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.\nWe're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes\nsnap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't\nstop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he\ncatches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.\nIn a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nHe comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is\nasleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark\nthoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes\ngoing deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to\nbrush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he\nstops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face\nclose to her and lightly kisses her.\n\nShe stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.\nThey stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and\ntouches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for\nanother kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,\nvery tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss\nagain, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the\nbed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his\nelbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,\nhungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she\nis a salvation, and there is a moment when they both\npause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are\ndoing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and\nbegin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as\nwe slowly...\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                                        85.\n\nINT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT\n\nThe night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody\nplace with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a\nlot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy\nblues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small\ndance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE\nAT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who\nmostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes\nmeet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there.\n\nThe music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head\nback to the tables, but the little band goes right into a\nmore up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and\npulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and\nfollows.\n\nThis number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch\nSharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free\nout there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   she\nlaughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wild\nand playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON    the\njoy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little\ncrazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nSAME - HOURS LATER\n\nThe blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is\nfinishing what seems to be its last number, for the last\nof thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and\nCatch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at\nher.\n\n                        CATCH\n          What's your favorite song?\n\nHe rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.     She\nsmiles, spent.\n\n                        SHARON\n          Catch, I'm beat. So are they.   I\n          think they're finished.\n\n                         CATCH\n          One more.

He\ntalks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER.\n\n\nSHARON'S POV\n\nFrom the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano,\nCatch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's\ntired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.\n\n                                                       86.\n\nON CATCH\n\nAs he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but\nexcited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.\n\n                             CATCH\n            Thanks, Danny.\n\n                          DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)\n            Gonna be good having you back,\n            Catch.\n\nCatch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit\nat Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering\nthe horn. He puts it to his lips.\n\n\nON SHARON\n\nMouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -\n- and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and\nrendering a ballad, like the haunting \"ANGEL EYES.\"\n\nSharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper\nlook, not only because he is so good, but because he is\nshowing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more\nthan he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he\nopens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the\nmusic, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as\nSharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and\nat this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT.

He has to kiss her. He holds her face and\ncomes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her\nsay softly.\n\n                          SHARON\n            Where I've never been kissed.\n\nHe stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and\nwalks her out into the middle of the traffic-less\nboulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses\nher, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest\nmoment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and\nprophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the\nrevolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS\nonce as they break, staring.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        87.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           SHARON\n             Oh, God.\n\nWe WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20\nfeet away.

He begins walking\ntoward the swings.\n\n\nANGLE - SANDBOX\n\nTommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a\nmetal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging\nplastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets\nthe big, friendly dog.\n\n\nANGLE - CANDACE\n\nShe sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit.\n\n                                                     89.\n\nON CATCH, TOMMY\n\nCatch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills\nout the contents of the bag -- action figures,\nsuperheroes, soldiers.

We see,\nin b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We\nnow have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is\nmoving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path\nnow. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch\nhears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out \"Thank\nyou,\" and Candace shouting \"Be careful!\" And Catch goes\ncold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike\npath, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure\nto be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops\n-- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and\nCandace comes running.\n\nCatch is rising, a little sore and soiled.        The biker is\nangry.\n\n                          BIKER\n            Goddammit -- I saw the kid.\n            Jesus. I wasn't even close.\n\nBut Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look,\nall shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots\nalong beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy\nand Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to\ncatch up. The Biker      reaches Catch first.\n\n                             BIKER\n            Wait a minute!

He wants to say more, to save face, but\nCatch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped,\nfrozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to\nhis downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly\nbelieve all of this, following Catch again.\n\n\nON CATCH, SHARON\n\n                               SHARON\n             Catch!

As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is\nlooking at that mural of the mountains and through this\nto her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises\nand goes to the phone, punches in a number.\n\n\nINT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nHe is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard,\nsitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up --\nas he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the\nincredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven\nway, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE\nbreaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His\nMACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS.

WESTWOOD STREET - CORNER - NEXT DAY\n\nCatch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village\nnot far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over\nthe passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off\nduty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots\nhim. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and\nsadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop\nand hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking\nslowly, and he walks beside her.

He shakes the next     music chart and\nsomething falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper,\npicks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of\nhimself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four\nor five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth that\ngoes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.\n\n                                                       107.\n\nEXT. STREET - NEXT DAY\n\nSharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall\nparking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still\nvery downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps\nglancing at her, concerned for her.\n\n                         ROBBY\n          Pogo...?\n\nShe puts up a hand to brush all the words away.

They\n          came through a back window last\n          night. Mostly vandalism...\n\nThey walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a\nlittle child, three years old or so, toddles out the door\nof a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon\nmakes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...\n\n                         SHARON\n          Whoa...\n\n... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes\nby shouting...\n\n                         SKATER\n          Sorry!\n\nAnd now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...\n\n                        WORRIED MOTHER\n          Oh, God, thank you. Billy!\n\nShe picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon\nstands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks\nher, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is,\nwhat he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few\nsteps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet,\nlooking around her now at the people walking among the\nshops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes.\nShe gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly,\nkindly, the person moves on.\n\n                         ROBBY\n          Pogo?\n\nShe doesn't move for a moment.

UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY\n\nWe see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the\nfront of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.\n\n\nEXT. CHU HOME - DAY\n\nSharon walks under that covered portico to the front\ndoor, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her\na bit.\n\n                            ELANORA (O.S.)\n             Pogo?\n\nMrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling\nher wheelchair toward Sharon.

I'm still finding my way\n             through it. And Catch -- it\n             almost kills him to think about it\n             or say it or drive a car or see\n             the place where it happened or...\n             go by the cemetery.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I was trying to help him... come\n             back to some kind of life.

His apartment, his\n             life, his music is coming back.\n             He fell in love! He even got a\n             job, Sharon -- for you. For the\n             two of you. Isn't that coming\n             back? Why do you have to rush?\n             Everybody has to rush these days.\n\nSharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed\nnow, realizing, admitting.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I was scared.

I\n             didn't know what I was doing.\n\nElanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,\nstudying Sharon's misery.\n\n                           ELANORA\n             You were finding your way.    What\n             else can we do? You think    I'm\n             always sure what to say to   him,\n             what not to say? I do what    I\n             think is right and hope he   sees\n             the love in it.\n\nShe shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing\nnow, liking this girl.\n\n                           ELANORA\n             Look at you -- so worried now, so\n             miserable.

I really don't.\n             But I think he'll see the love in\n             what you did.\n\nSharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand\nto touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her\nhand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with\nstrength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.\nElanora watches her go.\n\n\nINT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nIt's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her\nparents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with\nCatch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to\ngo through with this.\n\nWe START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next\nto that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,\nsee her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In\nthe b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I just came by to... wish you\n             well. To... congratulate you and\n             wish you well.

She does, and as the trumpet plays on we --\n\n                                           CUT TO:\n\n\nSHARON\n\ndressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --\n\n                                           CUT TO:\n\n\nSHARON\n\ndressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --\n\n                                           CUT TO:\n\n\nSHARON\n\nsitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap,\nlooking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY (SAME DAY)\n\nCatch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-\ndog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a\nmission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and\non into...\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nThe MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church,\nparking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is\nno one else outside the church. The ceremony has already\nbegun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church\nas the MUSIC FADES OUT.\n\n\nINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\nAs Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but\nperhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the\nceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,\naltar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a\nfew back from the altar. The slight disturbance of\npeople sliding over to let her in causes a few people to\nglance over.\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          114.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nOne of them is Kathy.

The little boy, looking\nfine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to\nlook at his aunt.\n\nSharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look.     She winks, then\nsettles back in her pew, watches.\n\n\nON ALTAR\n\nWe get our first   look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.\nStanding beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken\nwith the moment,   both he and his wife emotional over\nthis. He wears    a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.\n\n\nON SHARON\n\nwatching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and\nthe vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nThe PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,\ninvoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as\nwe watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps\nnow and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial\nChapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and\nthe determination. He walks through the gate.\n\n\nEXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY\n\nHe walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a\ngarden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and\nflowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving\ncloser to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on\nthe chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall\nof this building, he is alone.\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       115.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nThis is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on\neach vault is   a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in\nhis body as he   struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his\ngaze comes to   rest on a name: \"LAMBERT.\"\n\nAs he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church\nFADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is\nshaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,\nto them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries\nagain -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at\nfirst.\n\n                            CATCH\n             Annie. Chet. I don't... want you\n             to think I forgot about you.

It all\n             just... disappeared. In one\n             minute. I couldn't remember that\n             minute. I lost it. It took me so\n             long to find it. I think I found\n             it all now. I used a calculator.\n             I did. I figured it out. You\n             know... we get about 1400 minutes\n             a day and so I figured it out. I\n             was 33 years old and three months\n             and eight days, so it was... I've\n             got it here...\n\nHe fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand\nis shaking as he reads a number off the paper.\n\n                           CATCH\n             It was minute number 17 million\n             eight hundred ten thousand, two\n             hundred... or so.\n\nHe puts the paper away.\n\n                           CATCH\n             That's the one I lost. And...\n             when I lost that minute, I guess I\n             tried to lose it all, all the\n             memories -- because they hurt. I\n             tried, but... I couldn't do it.\n\nWe --\n\n                                                         116.\n\nFLASHBACK - INT. VAN\n\nto that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play out\neach piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,      his wife\nANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with      his\ngrandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy      is a bit\nwhiny, pouty.\n\nWe INTERCUT the flashback WITH --\n\n\nCATCH\n\nat the grave, struggling through this.\n\n                          CATCH\n            Chet... you weren't feeling so\n            good, remember? It was your\n            birthday, and you ate too much.\n\nWe see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and\nwe get   present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and\nAnnie   both say, \"What's the matter? Hm? Aww.\" And then\nAnnie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we\nCUT TO   Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.\n\n                          CATCH\n            And, Annie, you said... you\n            said...\n\nIn the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this\ntime we hear her say, softly...\n\n                          ANNIE\n            Slow down in the rain, all right?\n\nWe GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.\n\n                          CATCH\n            And I don't know if I slowed down.\n            I don't know. I hope I did,\n            but... I didn't always listen. I'm\n            sorry. I'm really sorry.\n\nBack in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as\nElanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave\nand INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through\nhis tears and we also see this tender moment played out\nin the van.\n\n                          CATCH\n            ... You put him on your lap, and\n            he looked at me, and I made a\n            face. Remember? I made you\n            smile, Chet.\n                          (MORE)\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           117.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           CATCH (CONT'D)\n             And then we all smiled, and it was\n             a great minute. It was. I'm\n             really glad... I found that\n             minute. No matter what.\n\nCatch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that\nminute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about\nthree seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly\nglaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,\nBRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.\nAnd Catch has been battered by the memory, and is\nweeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at\nthe name of his family, and he is able to say, in a\nbroken voice...\n\n                           CATCH\n             I won't forget... anymore.     I love\n             you.\n\nHe steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests\nit there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\nThe renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in\nthe aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are\nup and milling about, many leaving the church. \"See you\nat the house.\" \"See you at the party.\" Etc. A\nPHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the\nchurch. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the\nlittle boy...\n\n                          PHOTOGRAPHER\n             All right. The whole family in\n             this one. Just...\n\nOut of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath\nand braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Where do you want me?\n\nThe Photographer turns to her, wondering.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I'm the daughter.\n\n                            PHOTOGRAPHER\n             Oh!

Sharon follows the\nPhotographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside\nher Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo\nis taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is\ndifficult, the strain is thick in the air.\n\n                           SHARON\n             You both look so great.\n\n                           MOTHER\n                    (nervous)\n             You, too.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I just wanted to...\n\nThe Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat,\nnot warm either. No smile.\n\n                           FATHER\n             You coming to the party?\n\n                             SHARON\n             Sure.\n\nHe nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is\nleft alone by the drifting away of the family, but one\nold couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander)\nwearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside\nher.\n\n                             MRS. VANDER\n             Sherry!    Look how nice you look.\n\n                           HUSBAND\n             Big police officer now.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Not so big.\n                    (to Mrs. Vander)\n             Nice dress.\n\nSharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up\nwith Larry and his family.\n\n\nEXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY\n\nAs Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of\nthe church, calling ahead.\n\n                             SHARON\n             Larry...\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          119.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nHe starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes\nthe little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at\nSharon.\n\n\nON SHARON AND LARRY\n\nThey nod to a few passing guests. Then they're alone.\nHis nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and\nbetrayal in his eyes.\n\n                           LARRY\n             How did you have the guts to walk\n             into a church after breaking your\n             word?\n\n                           SHARON\n             I have to be here. It's a chance\n             to make things right, and I'm\n             taking it.\n\n                           LARRY\n             Why even talk go me? You got what\n             you wanted. You laugh about it?\n             You tell your cop friends how\n             you...\n\n                        SHARON\n          You think I talk about it?!    You\n          think...\n\nShe stops herself, catching her rush toward the old\nanger. She goes calmer, deeper, even sad.\n\n                          SHARON\n          Here, Lar.\n\nShe hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He\nlooks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks\nsoftly.\n\n                        SHARON\n          I was invited. I'm here. I'm\n          going to the party. You do what\n          you want.\n\nAnd she walks off toward the parking lot.\n\n\nINT. POGUE HOME - DAY\n\nWe're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting\na bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         120.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nThough the home and yard are thick with people, there is\nsome tension, especially in the core group -- all who\nknow about the estrangement of Sharon. Now and then a\nnervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or\na hostile glance from Larry.\n\nSharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,\ncamera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put\ntheir good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks over\nand sees her Father across the room. He is alone. She\nsteels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,\nthen averts his look. She is approaching him, about to\nspeak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking\nwith them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.\n\nHer mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking\nquietly, nervously.\n\n                           MOTHER\n             Don't make him talk about...\n             anything today.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Mom, I was going to fix his tie.\n             His tie is crooked.\n\nShe sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...\n\n                           SHARON\n             It was a nice ceremony.\n\n                           MOTHER\n                    (worried)\n             Yes. We're running out of\n             chicken, though. Nobody's eating\n             the ham.\n\n                           SHARON\n             It's a great party, Mom.   You look\n             happy.\n\nSome joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Thirty-five years and still in\n             love, huh?\n\nHer Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.\n\n                           MOTHER\n             You think that's wrong, don't you?\n\n                           SHARON\n             Of course not...\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         121.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           MOTHER\n             I always... I feel like\n             apologizing to you. But I love\n             him.\n\n                          SHARON\n             I know.\n\n                           MOTHER\n             And then I feel like apologizing\n             to him for loving you. I'm the\n             one in the middle. I'm the only\n             one in this family who knows how\n             to forgive anybody.\n\nAnd she walks away. Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised\nand thoughtful. She watches her Mother approach her\nFather and straighten his crooked tie. Then Kathy is\nmoving toward Sharon. Sharon turns to her and they both\nspeak quietly -- at the same time.\n\n                           BOTH\n             You look great.\n\nThen they smile sad smiles.       Kathy gestures to her face,\nthe faded bruise.\n\n                           KATHY\n             Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.\n\nThey smile wryly again.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Sorry about that, but... I\n             couldn't stand him doing that to\n             you. I took it on...\n\n                           KATHY\n             Don't worry. I'm not your mother.\n             If he tries it again, I'm gone.\n             I'm out of there, me and Larry\n             Junior. He knows that.\n\nThey stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it.\n\n\nON LARRY\n\nWe see Larry, across the room, notice this hug. He keeps\nhis expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a\nflare of anger in his eyes.\n\n                                                          122.\n\nON SHARON\n\nmoving across the living room.\n\nShe sees Larry Jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits\nbeside the child -- who looks sad.\n\n                          SHARON\n            What's up with you?\n\n                          LARRY JR.\n            They won't let me watch T.V.\n\n                         SHARON\n            Oh. Well... let's pretend this is\n            T.V. It's a show about a party.\n\nThey look about the room.\n\n                          SHARON\n                   (as if it's a secret)\n            That man... is really a super\n            hero.\n\n                            LARRY JR.\n            Is not.\n\n                          SHARON\n            Is too.

Oh-oh, that man gave her\n            a drink with something in it.\n\n                            LARRY JR.\n            With what?\n\n                          SHARON\n            With stuff to make her sleep.\n            He's a bad guy.\n\nThe woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting\ninto it.\n\n                            LARRY\n            She drank it.\n\n                         SHARON\n            Watch. She'll fall down any\n            minute.\n\nThe boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his\nfather. Larry puts the boy down near the door.\n\n                          LARRY\n            Hey, sport, you should go play\n            outside.\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       123.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nHe turns to Sharon.\n\n                           LARRY\n             Stay away from my family.\n\nThen he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without\nhumor, speaking loudly.\n\n                           LARRY\n             Hey, everybody, keep it down.\n             Somebody might call the police.\n\nThere is some nervous laughter, people watching them now.\nSharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.\n\n                           SHARON\n             What're you doing?\n\n                           LARRY\n                    (to crowd)\n             Once the cops leave, we can really\n             party.\n\nThe crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns\nback to Sharon.\n\n                           LARRY\n             Why don't you give everybody a\n             break -- and go home?\n\nIn the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and\nSHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon\nlooks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother\nnervously picking up the broken glass -- no support\nthere. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door.\n\nShe walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts\nto close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a\nbreath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt\nand anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She\npushes it open and walks back    in.\n\nWe see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried\nlook from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the\ncrowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads\ntoward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen,\navoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his\nMother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward\nthe kitchen.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nSharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen,\nleaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow\nthem.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          124.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           SHARON\n             Don't walk away.

Do you want\n          me to leave?\n\n                           FATHER\n             Up to you.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Dad... I'm asking.

Do you love\n             me, Dad? I want to know.\n\nThe question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and\nthe silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods\ntoward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper,\nthick with tears.\n\n                           SHARON\n             Do you... need to... check that\n             again?\n\n                              FATHER\n             I feel like...\n\nHe can't finish it.\n\n                            SHARON\n             What, Dad?

She speaks quietly, softly.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           126.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           SHARON\n             Well... you do.

LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nSharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears.\nThe party goes on around her, oblivious.    She stops on\nher way to the door because she sees the   video crew\nmoving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a\ndecision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, faces\nthe camera.\n\n                           SHARON\n             I'm next.\n\nAs they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.       Sharon\nspeaks over a torrent of emotions.\n\n                           SHARON\n                    (to camera)\n             Hi, Mom and Dad.

I was\n             about ten, I guess, and Larry and\n             I were playing aliens -- remember,\n             Lar? We're making a lot  of noise,\n             and Dad comes home from work tired\n             and pissed off...\n                                                 CUT TO:\n\nHER FATHER\n\nwatching this.

I hit\n             that couch and bounce off, and he\n             grabs Larry and throws him on the\n             couch, and then... then he starts\n             making these monster sounds, and\n             he says, we came to earth to kick\n             ass, and I run at him and jump on\n             him and he tosses me on the couch\n             and then Larry, and we're laughing\n             so hard I almost wet myself, and\n             he keeps tossing us and growling\n             and beeping, and it was... it was\n             great. It was great, and I'm\n             never going to forget that.\n             Never. And I miss that. I miss\n             it. So I just... I wanted to tell\n             you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.\n             That's all.\n                    (pause)\n             Bye.\n\nShe hands the microphone back and walks away as the\nsurprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother,\nLarry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door\nand leaves.\n\n\nEXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY\n\nSharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr.\nlook up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns\nthe smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As\nshe reaches    the gate, she notices something across the\nstreet that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so\npleased.\n\n\nHER POV\n\nCatch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT\n\nas Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him\n-- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her,\nuntil she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he\nopens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on\ntight, eyes closed.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         128.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nThey break the embrace, still holding on, searching each\nother's eyes.\n\n                            CATCH\n             Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.\n\n                              SHARON\n             Me, too.\n\nIn a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.\n\n                              CATCH\n             Was it bad?\n\n                           SHARON\n             They don't like me in there.\n\n                           CATCH\n             Then they don't deserve you in\n             there.\n\nShe stares a moment more, still together.\n\n                           SHARON\n             That's a nice thing to say.\n\n                           CATCH\n             It's not a thing to say.   It's the\n             truth.\n\nShe can only look away, not wanting to cry.\n\n                           CATCH\n             Why do you try so hard not to cry?\n\nShe stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears,\nmouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally,\nwith nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much\nas mourning.\n\n                              SHARON\n             It's not fair.\n\nThe tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the\nold, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The\nfirst time we've seen her cry.\n\n                           SHARON\n             It's not fair. Things got better\n             for them because of what I did.\n             Things got better, and I'd still\n             do it. I'd do it all over again.\n             And it's not fair they shut me\n             out.

I was     19, and I\n             didn't know what else    to do. I\n             didn't know how else    to stop it.\n             It's not fair I don't    have a\n             family anymore.\n\n                            CATCH\n             No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.\n\nHe raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on\neach cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and\ncloses her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a\nmoment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth\nto his words...\n                        CATCH\n          We're the family, Pogo.\n\nShe opens her eyes, staring deep into       his. He has said\nit all -- as it is and as it will be.        She smiles a bit\nthrough her tears and nods. He puts        an arm around her\nshoulder and holds her tight against       him as they walk to\nher car. She puts an arm around his        waist.\n\nThey reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind\nthe wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.\n\n\nINT. CAR - DAY\n\nSharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from\ncrying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't\nmove -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her.\nIn a moment, he gets out of the car.\n\n\nEXT. CAR - FULL SHOT\n\nCatch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the\nwindow down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he\nleaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and\nsays without a fuss...\n\n                           CATCH\n          I'll drive.\n\nShe stares a long moment,    realizing,    but also making no\nfuss about it as she gets    out of the    car, walks around\nand enters the passenger    side. They     close the car doors.\nCatch STARTS the CAR and    drives them    away. Drives them\nhome.\n                                                   FADE OUT.\n\n                            THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nAngel Eyes\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Gerald DiPego\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:26.307386"}
