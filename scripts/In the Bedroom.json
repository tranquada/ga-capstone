He stares at the ceiling Reliving it\r\n          His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.\r\n          The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.\r\n          But he won't. Not today.\r\n          There is a small crack in the ceiling.\r\n          He'll have to fix that.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BLACK\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          - THE FAINT SOUNDS FADE UP\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         THE END\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/In-the-Bedroom.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>In the Bedroom</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Robert Festinger\" title=\"Scripts by Robert Festinger\">Robert Festinger</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Todd Field\" title=\"Scripts by Todd Field\">Todd Field</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/In the Bedroom Script.html#comments\" title=\"In the Bedroom comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:55.072475"}
