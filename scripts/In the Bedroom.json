GI'S POINT\r\n\r\n          We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.\r\n          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at\r\n          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with\r\n          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a\r\n          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years\r\n          younger, in hot pursuit.\r\n          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient\r\n          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young\r\n          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.\r\n\r\n                         CLOSER NOW\r\n          We see them in glimpses:\r\n          Their eyes - Lips - Hands\r\n          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.\r\n          She reaches out and strokes his hand.\r\n          He stares at their fingers mingling together.\r\n          The woman sighs.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          I Love it here.\r\n          I know you do...\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          I can feel my life - ya know.\r\n          He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.\r\n          A legend appears: Il -_ 1\r\n          THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:\r\n\r\n          T.

She stands wit two small boys who\r\n          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son\r\n          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in\r\n          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.\r\n          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,\r\n          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his\r\n          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a\r\n          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.\r\n          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is\r\n          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his\r\n          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.\r\n          Natalie smiles back.\r\n\r\n                         NATALIE\r\n          Morn'in Dr. Fowler.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Morn'in Natalie.

STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN\r\n          Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their\r\n          journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into\r\n          cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we\r\n          will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS.\r\n\r\n          I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN\r\n          A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their\r\n          bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning\r\n          small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs\r\n          to their equipment, and so on.\r\n          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been\r\n          used as a scratch pad for years.\r\n          Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HARBOR - SAME\r\n\r\n          A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The\r\n          bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with\r\n          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear\r\n          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -\r\n          the shoes pick up the pace.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HARBOR - S\r\n\r\n          Matt & Frank prepare the rig.\r\n          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of\r\n          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a\r\n          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR\r\n          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem\r\n          exotic.\r\n          Jason's eyes find the hull of \"GIGI\" an old Boudreau built\r\n          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.\r\n\r\n                         F\r\n          C'mon up Jace.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Hold on a second.

It roars to life.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HARBOR LATER\r\n\r\n          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as \"GIGI\"\r\n          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits\r\n          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.\r\n          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the\r\n          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap\r\n          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Thank you.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Ever been over there?\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          No sir.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore\r\n          though. It's a city. They have electric\r\n          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail\r\n          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's\r\n          run by a computer When I lived there,\r\n          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have\r\n          cars, can you believe that?\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          How'd you get back?\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Off the island?\r\n          Jason nods.\r\n          We rowed.\r\n          Matt smiles at the memory.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         5\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Then we got a little outboard. That was\r\n          great. A seven and a half horsepower it\r\n          was - we lived there until I was about\r\n          your age - then we left and became\r\n          \"harbor people\".\r\n          Jason seems to be digesting this.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          I a \"harbor person\"?\r\n          Matt hides a smile about to form.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Yep, Jason - we all are.\r\n          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and\r\n          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.\r\n\r\n                         F\r\n          At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts\r\n          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.\r\n          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA\r\n          LINE into the WINCH.\r\n          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it \"Doors up\" on the edge. He\r\n          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He\r\n          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER\r\n          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER\r\n          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to\r\n          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot\r\n          surfaces.\r\n          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN\r\n          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the\r\n          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.\r\n          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Oh boy you see what happened to\r\n          this poor fel ow?\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          .what?\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Well, the trap has nylon nets called\r\n          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the\r\n          lobster can crawl in. The \"Bedroom\" head\r\n          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from\r\n          escaping--you know the old saying \"two's\r\n          company three-s a crowd\"?\r\n          Jason nods.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Well{ it's like that. You get more than\r\n          two in a bedroom and chances are\r\n          something like this is going to happen.\r\n          That's why Frank can't leave these traps\r\n          for more than a day.\r\n          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There\r\n          are black balls on both sides of the tail.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Now the older females like this of gal,\r\n          are the most dan erous - especially when\r\n          they're growin' eyries.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Berries?\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n          Eggs... .one of these can take out two\r\n          males easy - Then you wind up with\r\n          lobster you can't sell - and as for this\r\n          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state\r\n          says you have to let her go.\r\n          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.\r\n\r\n                         TT\r\n          Can you handle this?\r\n          Jason nods.\r\n\r\n                         MATT\r\n\r\n                         (GENTLY)\r\n          You sure?\r\n          He really isn't.

FOWLER HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is\r\n          manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in\r\n          their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,\r\n          post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful,\r\n          d you on't freeze in the winter.\r\n          The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops\r\n          the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing\r\n          of a SWING-SET.\r\n\r\n                         Q\r\n\r\n          FRANK O.S.\r\n          Hey, dad can you give me a hand?\r\n          The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT.

HIGHER!\r\n          SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt\r\n          Gun fight in progress.\r\n\r\n          ACROSS THE YARD\r\n          a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs &\r\n          burgers.

ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT\r\n          Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's\r\n          classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess.\r\n          The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of\r\n          the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther.

Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping\r\n          time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings \"The\r\n          Drone\"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.\r\n          They sing the Balkan folk song \"Oj Savice.\"\r\n\r\n                         CHORUS (SUBTITLED)\r\n          Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool\r\n          water.

The music transports these girls - who are\r\n          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a\r\n          place of pure self. The song ends.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          That was really good!
