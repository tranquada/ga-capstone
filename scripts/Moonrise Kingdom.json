BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is\r\n          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide\r\n          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and\r\n          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at\r\n          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are\r\n          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.\r\n                         \r\n          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling\r\n          the gutters.\r\n                         \r\n          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully\r\n          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel\r\n          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He\r\n          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the\r\n          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.\r\n                         \r\n          A child's voice says over the speaker:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)\r\n</b>           In order to show you how a big symphony\r\n           orchestra is put together, Benjamin\r\n           Britten has written a big piece of music,\r\n           which is made up of smaller pieces that\r\n           show you all the separate parts of the\r\n           orchestra.\r\n                         \r\n          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their\r\n          bedrooms and down to the landing.\r\n                         \r\n          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is\r\n          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer\r\n          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a\r\n          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high\r\n          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is\r\n          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.\r\n                         \r\n          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They\r\n          lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their\r\n          fists, listening.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly\r\n          and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the\r\n          cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her\r\n          neck.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She\r\n          raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out\r\n          into the rain.\r\n<b>           2.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside\r\n          with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings\r\n          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The\r\n          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland\r\n          is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,\r\n          watching.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         TITLES OVER:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.\r\n                         \r\n          In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They\r\n          shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat\r\n          grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a\r\n          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed\r\n          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.\r\n          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly\r\n          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,\r\n          topless, in the kitchen sink.\r\n                         \r\n          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet\r\n          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker\r\n          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.\r\n          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.\r\n                         \r\n          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula\r\n          curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.\r\n          A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the\r\n          sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a\r\n          tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the\r\n          narrator. He speaks to the camera:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          NARRATOR\r\n</b>           This is the island of New Penzance.\r\n           Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-\r\n           growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by\r\n           shallow tidal creeks. An important\r\n           seabird habitat. There are no paved roads\r\n           but instead many miles of intersecting\r\n           foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry\r\n           that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.\r\n           The year is 1965. We are on the far edge\r\n           of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the\r\n           ferocious and well-documented storm which\r\n           will strike from the east on the fifth of\r\n           September -- in three day's time.\r\n<b>           3.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched\r\n          in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It\r\n          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow\r\n          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch\r\n          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.\r\n                         \r\n          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges\r\n          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.\r\n          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown\r\n          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin\r\n          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.\r\n          He is Gadge.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Morning, Gadge.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GADGE\r\n</b>           Morning, sir.\r\n                         \r\n          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout\r\n          Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and\r\n          rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an\r\n          army-shovel. He is Deluca.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Deluca. Latrine inspection.\r\n                         \r\n          Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down\r\n          a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and\r\n          a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Good.\r\n                         \r\n          Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops\r\n          in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a\r\n          stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Roosevelt.

It has been braided exceedingly\r\n          badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen.\r\n<b>           4.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks\r\n          perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a\r\n          secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master\r\n          Ward strides away.\r\n                         \r\n          An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the\r\n          tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,\r\n          and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.\r\n                         \r\n          Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs\r\n          stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and\r\n          a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is\r\n          Skotak.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Skotak.

Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small\r\n          platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two\r\n          scouts are sawing something in half on it. Scout Master Ward\r\n          looks astonished.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           That's not a safe altitude.\r\n                         \r\n          Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up\r\n          at the tree house. He stammers:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Why's it up so high?

Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward\r\n          strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with\r\n          tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be\r\n          contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Nickleby.

He stops in front of a work-bench covered with\r\n          newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel\r\n          into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a\r\n          metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of\r\n          the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his\r\n          cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           How many rockets you up to, Panagle?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          PANAGLE\r\n</b>           Sixteen and a half.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b><b>                          (TO GADGE)\r\n</b>           That enough for the Jubilee?\r\n                         \r\n          Gadge shakes his head.

He picks\r\n          up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from\r\n          under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it.

The rest of\r\n          the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the\r\n          center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large\r\n          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the\r\n          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir\r\n          loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a\r\n          brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next\r\n          cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.\r\n                         \r\n          Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the\r\n          church.

A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform\r\n          watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Sam quietly entering the lobby.

The room is jammed with children\r\n          dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that\r\n<b>           19.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          winds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large\r\n          woman stares through a small window into the church with her\r\n          hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers\r\n          suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.\r\n          Pause.\r\n                         \r\n          Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room\r\n          again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They\r\n          march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the\r\n          doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to\r\n          wait.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and\r\n          skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching\r\n          horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He\r\n          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a\r\n          bowl and sucks on it.

He steps into the light\r\n          silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection.

There is an illustration on the cover of a young,\r\n          alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam\r\n          examines the other books in the suitcase.

Pause. Suzy dumps her\r\n          fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a\r\n          frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She\r\n          stands up and says coolly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SUZY\r\n</b>           You really know how to make friends.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a\r\n          rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He\r\n          is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches\r\n          the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He\r\n          stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down,\r\n          and holds it out.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           I'm sorry.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy looks to Sam.

She unfolds the neckerchief and studies\r\n          its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off\r\n          the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           Which one's the best?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his\r\n          pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads\r\n          aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an\r\n          illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a\r\n          bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SUZY\r\n</b>           His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins,\r\n           Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the\r\n           rippling surface of the cool shallows and\r\n           down to its stone floor. \"My people once\r\n           were lead by a great and noble beast --\r\n           and I no longer see his face in this\r\n           reflection.\"\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of\r\n          his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a\r\n          blanket over his chest. She continues:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SUZY\r\n</b>           Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha,\r\n           Francine rested.

There is a long, wide, empty table with\r\n          sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel,\r\n          Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have\r\n          plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra\r\n          seat.

She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an\r\n          electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on\r\n          the card table and looks out the window.

Other\r\n          scouts search the field and scan the horizon.\r\n                         \r\n          Captain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are\r\n          parked in the dirt.\r\n<b>           39.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          Mr. Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the\r\n          ground with a stick. He has two black eyes, and half his face\r\n          is swollen and purple. Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           What happened to him?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          BECKY\r\n</b>           I'm not sure. I think he went searching\r\n           in the dark.\r\n                         \r\n          Mr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           MR.

Becky raises\r\n          an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They\r\n          move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers\r\n          quickly, almost inaudibly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          CAPTAIN SHARP\r\n</b>           I think he's onto us.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           MRS.

He shouts excitedly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          NICKLEBY\r\n</b>           Cat food! I think it's a clue.\r\n                         \r\n          The group quickly gathers around Nickleby. Mr. Bishop\r\n          snatches the can out of his hand and examines it. He says\r\n<b>                         BLANKLY:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>           MR.

Nickleby runs after the\r\n          can and picks it up again. Mr. Bishop continues down the\r\n          hill. Scout Master Ward watches him. He asks Mrs. Bishop,\r\n<b>                         UNEASY:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Where's he going?\r\n                         \r\n<b>           MRS.

Captain Sharp turns to the\r\n          rest of the group and says briskly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          CAPTAIN SHARP\r\n</b>           All right.

Until help arrives:\r\n                         \r\n          Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to\r\n          various scouts and divides the group into teams:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          CAPTAIN SHARP\r\n</b>           I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny\r\n           one, and the kid with the curly hair to\r\n           come with me in the station wagon. Randy,\r\n           you drop-in and head up-river with the\r\n           rest of your troop, then split-up on\r\n           foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to\r\n           circle over this end of the island and\r\n           fly low.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern. It\r\n          banks sharply. The binocular shot tilts down. Far below, in\r\n          the distance, Captain Sharp's station wagon rumbles along a\r\n          dirt road through the woods. The binocular shot pans wide. On\r\n          the side of the river, Scout Master Ward's motorboat stops.\r\n<b>           41.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          Two scouts, tiny figures, pull the camouflage net off the\r\n          hidden canoe.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

Suzy says\r\n<b>                         OMINOUSLY:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          SUZY\r\n</b>           They found the canoe.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           (angry at himself)\r\n           Rats!

We're almost there.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle\r\n          over his arm. Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten\r\n          on her shoulder. They walk down a narrow path through a\r\n          thicket. They emerge into a small clearing.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks.\r\n                         \r\n          Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row\r\n          along the edge of the woods ahead of them. Deluca brandishes\r\n          his hunting knife. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their\r\n          bows and arrows. Panagle holds his walking stick weapon. The\r\n          wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash.\r\n          Deluca jerks him back. The kitten cowers. The sound of a\r\n          motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a\r\n          wheelie, and skids to a stop. He lifts his goggles.\r\n                         \r\n          The motor idles. Sam says finally:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           What do you creeps want?\r\n                         \r\n          Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          REDFORD\r\n</b>           We're looking for you.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           Why?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          REDFORD\r\n</b>           Because you're a fugitive.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           No, I'm not.

Sam flips his air-rifle off\r\n          his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and\r\n          Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           Do not cross this stick.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him.

The rest of the troop\r\n          converges, yelling crazily.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small\r\n          explosion. One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and\r\n          Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill.\r\n          Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and\r\n          clutching his side.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering\r\n          in the branches of a tree.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of\r\n          bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the\r\n          scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back\r\n          to Suzy. He says gently:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           It was him or us.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy nods. She turns slowly away.

The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the\r\n          ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder\r\n          blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over\r\n          to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the\r\n          kitten away, and says bleakly:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           They got Snoopy through the neck.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy has tears in her eyes.

It forms an\r\n          almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers,\r\n          and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand\r\n          on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and\r\n          crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from\r\n          tree to tree.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten\r\n          wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is\r\n          open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker:\r\n<b>           50.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)\r\n</b>           Onto the bird-house, where every kind of\r\n           bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling\r\n           around. This is a real acrobatic act for\r\n           our gifted young flute player, Paula\r\n           Robeson.\r\n                         \r\n          As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks\r\n          and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove.\r\n          They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each\r\n          other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts,\r\n<b>                         SMILING:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          SUZY\r\n</b>           This is weird.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           I know!\r\n                         \r\n          Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside.

Suzy take off\r\n          everything except her underwear and a training bra. They\r\n          throw their clothes into the water.

The tent has been\r\n          pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water. Two lines\r\n          of shells mark a path to the entrance. A long stick is jammed\r\n          into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into\r\n          the Y at the top. The kitten is asleep.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel. He\r\n          dips his brush into a tin cup and paints.

Scout\r\n          Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy-\r\n          Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr.\r\n          Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police\r\n          launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St.\r\n          Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further\r\n          away. Men in red caps stand on their decks.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She\r\n          kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           MR. BISHOP\r\n</b>           Suzy!

This reveals:\r\n                         \r\n          Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing.\r\n                         \r\n          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to\r\n          them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a\r\n          monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face\r\n          suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands\r\n          Sam and Suzy:\r\n                         \r\n<b>           MRS.

Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy\r\n          by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto\r\n          each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go,\r\n          and Suzy is gone.\r\n                         \r\n          Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his\r\n          uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other\r\n          scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:\r\n<b>           56.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\r\n</b>           Strike this camp.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam starts putting on his socks.

Scout Master Ward stiffens,\r\n          watchful. The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly\r\n          onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside,\r\n          something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into\r\n          flames.\r\n                         \r\n          Secretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still,\r\n          watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and\r\n          shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout\r\n          Master Ward makes a snap decision.

He descends back into\r\n          the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the\r\n          embankment.

Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags\r\n          and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns\r\n          distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs\r\n          and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls\r\n          outside the doors and windows.

Eleven children\r\n          dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp\r\n          does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing\r\n          Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to\r\n          her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,\r\n          embroidered patches on it.\r\n                         \r\n          The front doors open.

The narrator, now in shirtsleeves, concludes:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          NARRATOR\r\n</b>           But harvest yields the following autumn\r\n           far exceeded any previously recorded, and\r\n           the quality of the crops was said to be\r\n           extraordinary.\r\n                         \r\n          The narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera --\r\n          then turns away and walks down the hillside.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record\r\n          player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning. A\r\n          child's voice says over the speaker:\r\n<b>           104.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)\r\n</b>           So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten\r\n           has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now\r\n           he puts it back together again in a\r\n           fugue.\r\n                         \r\n          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,\r\n          propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The\r\n          Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the\r\n          cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail\r\n          looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at\r\n          Suzy's feet.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He\r\n          wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved\r\n          uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.\r\n                         \r\n          Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the\r\n<b>                         STAIRS:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>           MRS.

Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the\r\n<b>                         MEGAPHONE:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)\r\n</b>           Don't make us ask twice!\r\n                         \r\n          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the\r\n          stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,\r\n          and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.\r\n          Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SAM\r\n</b>           See you tomorrow.\r\n                         \r\n          Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the\r\n          window and looks out with her binoculars.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running\r\n          across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the\r\n          dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of\r\n          his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into\r\n          the car and drive off.\r\n<b>           105.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel\r\n          and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the\r\n          stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play\r\n          on the empty landing.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is\r\n          a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is\r\n          pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on\r\n          the clothesline. Written in the sand with seashells just at\r\n          the water's edge are the words:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>                          MOONRISE KINGDOM\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Moonrise-Kingdom.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Moonrise Kingdom</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Wes Anderson\" title=\"Scripts by Wes Anderson\">Wes Anderson</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Roman Coppola\" title=\"Scripts by Roman Coppola\">Roman Coppola</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Moonrise Kingdom Script.html#comments\" title=\"Moonrise Kingdom comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:11:55.292972"}
