One boy, Manoj, became\r\n          my friend. We played a lot of\r\n          cricket together, played anything\r\n          we could. And that's how it\r\n          stayed for years.

I will never be this\r\n          happy again. And I was right.\r\n          Because quite suddenly it was\r\n          over.

At a polite\r\n          distance, Evelyn and Douglas wait. Graham knocks at the\r\n          open door.\r\n          A woman, GAURIKA, appears. She stares at Graham.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GRAHAM\r\n</b>          I'm sorry to disturb you so late.\r\n          My name is Graham Dashwood.

Gaurika calls in\r\n          Hindi.\r\n          A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ.\r\n          He looks across at the house. Stands up slowly as Graham\r\n          walks across the street towards him.\r\n          Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a\r\n          moment. Then they hug very tightly.\r\n          From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches.\r\n          Evelyn looks at her, fascinated.\r\n          Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each\r\n          other, unable to let go.\r\n\r\n<b>          120 EXT.

Something passes between them that embarrasses\r\n          them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily.\r\n          They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite\r\n          timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.\r\n\r\n<b>                         WAITER\r\n</b>          Come, please.
