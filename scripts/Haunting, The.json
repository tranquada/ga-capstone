Then a loud FLAPPING SOUND.  It \n     shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something \n     moving among the wall hangings.\n\n     As the TITLE appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the VOICES,\n     agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman.\n\n     <b>FADE IN:</b>\n\n<b>     EXT.

The\n     BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a \n     tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.  And there, the source \n     of the sound --\n\n     -- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.  The umbrella-like clothes line \n     on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to \n     get in.\n\n     THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.  The VOICES \n     rise over the banging, becoming intelligible --\n\n<b>     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\n     -- becoming a fight.  <b>JANE</b>, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels\n     across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.\n\n<b>                               JANE\n</b>                   It'll take a month to probate the\n                   will, Nell!  A month!  Even if\n                   Mother left you something, you\n                   won't get it in time to pay the\n                   rent.  So instead of complaining,\n                   you should be thanking Lou for\n                   getting you these two weeks to get\n                   Mother's things packed.\n\n     At first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  At first we don't\n     even notice her.  Then we do...\n\n     Holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain,\n     like a part of the faded room is <b>ELEANOR VANCE</b>, 20's -- Nell.\n     She stares at the door.  The clothes line raps at the begrimed\n     glass.\n\n                               JANE (cont'd)\n                   Nell?\n\n     The wind dies, the banging stops.  Nell seems to hear Jane and \n     peers over at her, then across the room to Jane's bored husband,\n     <b>LOU</b>.  He's turning a Franklin Mint commemorative coin set in his\n     hands, studying it.\n\n<b>                               LOU\n</b>                   You're still going to have to\n                   settle with your mother's landlord \n                   on the back rent.\n\n     Nell watches Jane's little boy, <b>RICHIE</b>.  Unpacified by the \n     cartoons on the TV, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through \n     neat rows of delicate PORCELAIN DOLLS.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a \n                   job.  I'll get my own apartment.\n\n     Richie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the \n     carpet.  His parents don't notice.  But Nell feels it in the soul.  \n     Richie stops.  A long beat.  He looks at her, insolent, then plows \n     on with his tank.\n\n<b>                               JANE\n</b>                   Nell.  A job?  Two months and\n                   where is this job?  You have no\n                   degree, you've never worked --\n\n     Nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   -- I've never worked? --\n\n<b>                               JANE\n</b>                   You have no experience in the\n                   world... the regular world.  What \n                   would you put on a resume?\n                          (beat, softening)\n                   Now we all appreciate what you did \n                   for Mother.  Isn't that right, \n                   Lou?\n\n<b>                               LOU\n</b>                   Eleven years.

And in \n                   return you can have the extra \n                   room.\n\n     She goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her \n     generosity.  All Nell can do is stare.\n\n     And then: KNOCK KNOCK.  Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and\n     turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room.  It's all \n     reflex.  Nell catches herself.\n\n     KNOCK KNOCK.  Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on \n     the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals:\n\n<b>                               RICHIE\n</b>                   Eleanor, help me!  I've got to \n                   pee!\n\n     Nell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of \n     TRAUMA flickers over her face.  The reaction is so strong we \n     instantly know something is very wrong.\n\n<b>                               LOU\n</b>                   Richie, knock it off before I beat \n                   the crap out of you!\n\n     Nell turns away, sick, breathing hard.\n\n     Jane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser.\n\n<b>                               JANE\n</b>                   You're sure this is all of \n                   Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said \n                   to make sure we took it to him...\n                          (beat)\n                   He said there might be some \n                   antique pieces.  Have you seen\n                   anything?  Some of it might be\n                   valuable.\n\n     Nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  Jane no longer \n     can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch.  She nods at \n     Lou.  Lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  Richie follows him out.\n\n                               JANE (cont'd)\n                   Think about our offer, Nell.  You \n                   don't know how hard it is out \n                   there.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty.\n     And then bursts into tears.  Shaking, she digs in her back pocket \n     and pulls out a FINE FILIGREE NECKLACE.  Her mother's.  It's from \n     an age gone by.\n\n     Clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.\n\n<b>     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell crosses the living room straight for the closed French doors, \n     the glass obscured by gauze curtains.  She throws them open and \n     enters --\n\n<b>     INT. SICK ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- what once was a dining room.  Transformed into a sick room.  \n     Drawn shades.  Dim.  The first traces of dust.\n\n     Nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted.\n\n     A perfectly made bed.  The PILLOW, however retains the IMPRESSION \n     of a head.  Lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a CANE.  On \n     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet.  I.V. stand.  \n     Shrouded white shapes.\n\n     On the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: A PLACE \n     FOR EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.  A bit of wisdom.  A way \n     to live a life.\n\n     A way Nell has lived for too long.  Seeing it galvanizes her into\n     movement.  She goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it,\n     removes a BOTTLE OF TYLENOL WITH CODEINE and marches out.\n\n<b>     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales.  She has \n     been holding her breath.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and Tylenol in \n     front of her.  The necklace dangles from her fingers.  She stares, \n     mesmerized by it.  Then she undoes the hasp.  The clothes line \n     outside BATTERS louder --\n\n     -- and, defiant, Nell puts the necklace on.  She closes her eyes.\n\n     Silence.  The battering has stopped.  A BEAT.  And then the PHONE \n     RINGS.  Nell opens her eyes.  The phone RINGS.  Keeps ringing.  \n     Nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor.\n                   -- Where?  Yes, it's right here.\n\n     Nell listens for a long moment.  She picks up the classifieds, \n     flips through.  And there it is:\n\n<b>                         TROUBLE SLEEPING?\n</b>\n<b>     WANTED - RESEARCH SUBJECTS.  $900.00/.WEEK + RM.&amp;BD. @ BEAUTIFUL \n</b><b>     OLD HOUSE IN BERKSHIRES.  PSYCHOLOGY STUDY.\n</b>\n     <b>END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE</b>\n\n<b>     INT. PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY\n</b>\n     The lab feels more like the video center of a security office than \n     a psychologist's laboratory.  Two banks of black and white monitors \n     give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, \n     wired to electrodes.  They are taking psychological tests, although \n     we never see the Testers.  The subjects are working through \n     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests.  \n     There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  On \n     the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, \n     on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no \n     discernible sequence.  The subjects on the left are better able to \n     concentrate on their tasks.  The subjects on the right keep \n     stopping, and going over what they have done.\n\n     Two men, <b>MALCOLM KEOGH</b>, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the \n     head of the department; someone we trust.\n\n     He faces <b>PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW</b>.  He is a man whose confidence \n     rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two \n     is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  Right now, \n     though, he is defending himself before a Department Review.  This \n     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free \n     form.\n\n     The men are having a fight, and they are watched by OTHER \n<b>     PROFESSORS.\n</b>\n<b>                               MALCOLM\n</b>                   It's still an electric shock!\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Come on Malcolm, it's only seven\n                   ohms, it's nothing, it's like a\n                   joy buzzer!  And it's not about\n                   the pain, it's about the\n                   interference with concentration...\n\n     Malcolm looks at the monitor.

The subjects on the \n                   right, because the shocks are \n                   random, can't anticipate, and the \n                   distraction throws them off.\n\n<b>                               MALCOLM\n</b>                   Stop defending your science after \n                   the fact, Jim.

I know, I know, I know \n                   that \"Fear and Performance\" is a \n                   big sexy idea, but as long as I'm \n                   chairman here you will need this \n                   department's endorsement to \n                   publish it, and right now I can't \n                   do that.\n\n     At this moment, <b>MARY LAMBRETTA</b>, late 20's, Marrow's pretty T.A., \n     opens the door with an armload of files.

She's shaken.  Badly.\n\n<b>     EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell's Buick bounces over a country road.  The car works its way up\n     into the steep, switchbacking hills.\n\n<b>     INT.

A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back \n     twenty yards from the road.\n\n     There it is again.  Moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array \n     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it.\n\n     And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of\n     immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the \n     wall, chained and padlocked.\n\n<b>     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY\n</b>\n     The gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a \n     gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, \n     gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat.  \n     She reaches in and blows the HORN.\n\n     The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,\n     echoing.  Silence.\n\n     Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo\n     replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers \n     her ears.  Silence once again.\n\n     In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's\n     locked good.  She turns --\n\n     -- and there is a man right behind her.  It is <b>MR.

Sometimes a \n                   locked chain makes people on both \n                   sides of the fence just a little \n                   more comfortable.  Why would that \n                   be?\n\n     He unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  The \n     gates swing in, revealing HILL HOUSE.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Is there something about the \n                   house?\n\n<b>                               MR. DUDLEY\n</b>                   Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.\n\n     Grinning, Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through.  And at that \n     he just grins wider.  Nell pulls away.  Disturbed, she watches him \n     in the rearview mirror.  She turns and in front of her sprawls Hill \n     House.  At center, the features of the oldest part of the House \n     dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a \n     Grand Entry with carved ebony doors.\n\n<b>     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY\n</b>\n     The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the \n     carport.  In the silence all we can hear is her breathing.\n\n<b>     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n     Her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  Its brake lights \n     go off.\n\n     The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning \n     the car in place under the House's gaze.\n\n     Nell gets out of the car.\n\n     Nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.  A\n     romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.  Nell feels it, is drawn \n     to it.\n\n<b>     EXT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.  On \n     closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a \n     Garden of Eden.  At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam \n     takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve.\n\n     Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.  There is no answer.  Nell \n     looks around for some sign of life.\n\n     Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.  Somebody must've been\n     touching up the window trim.\n\n     When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. \n                   Dudley, are you here?  Anybody?\n\n     Tentative, she pushes it open into --\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far \n     above.  Rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains.  \n     Doors lead off in a half dozen directions.\n\n     Every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, \n     filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion.  It \n     overwhelms the eye.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Wow...\n\n     She turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor.  A short\n     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly \n     lit.\n\n     And then Nell hears a SOUND.  Carrying through the empty halls from\n     some distant place: a low, plaintive MOAN.\n\n     Nell freezes.  The MOANING stops.  Nell strains her ears.  And then \n     the MOAN again.  It comes from the short hallway ahead.  Nell \n     starts for it.  The Moan stops.\n\n<b>     INT. HALL FROM ENTRY TO GREAT HALL - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell moves down the hall.  It's dim, stale, lined with pier tables,\n     candelabra.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hello?  Hello?

Passages and doors lead off in all\n     directions to God-knows-where.  A double-grand staircase at the far \n     end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the \n     next floor.  Magnificent ANIMAL HEADS carved on the newel posts \n     glare at her.\n\n     Nell makes her way past clusters of furniture, stops at the center.\n     Silence.  An ENORMOUS FIREPLACE dominates one wall.  Large enough \n     to stand in.  An iron mesh SCREEN hangs in its mouth.  Mantle and \n     chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows \n     above.\n\n     The MOANING sound.  Nell spins away from the fireplace.  The sound \n     rises from the door at the very back of the hall.  Nell takes a \n     step toward it.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Mrs. Dudley?\n\n     She moves up to the door, puts a hand out to it.  The MOANING \n     rises. Nell pushes through --\n\n<b>     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLWAY TOWARDS KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- into a much narrower, curving hallway.  Doors all along it.  The\n     sound comes from the door right there across from the one Nell just\n     came through.  She flings it open --\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- and comes through into a vast kitchen.  A woman in black with \n     her back to Nell stands at a counter.  The moaning comes from a\n     disreputable old CAN OPENER.\n\n     Nell breaths, feels stupid.  The woman senses her, turns from her \n     cans of potatoes.  She is <b>MRS. DUDLEY</b>, sallow, unsmiling.\n\n<b>                               MRS. DUDLEY\n</b>                   It's make the soup or answer the \n                   door.

It unsettles Nell.\n\n                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)\n                   I'll show you your room.\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY/MEZZANINE - DAY\n</b>\n     Mrs. Dudley glides up the stairs.  Nell follows, hoisting her \n     suitcase after her.  It appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a \n     hallway.  But as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an \n     ENORMOUS OIL PAINTING.  In it stands a man, his features lost in \n     the shadows above, only his body visible.\n\n     The nameplate reads HUGH CRAIN.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hugh Crain.\n\n     Nell looks up: Mrs. Dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs.\n\n<b>     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY\n</b>\n     Mrs. Dudley leads Nell down a curved hallway, over aged Persian\n     carpets and turns to a door on her left.  She throws it open, \n     stands back.  Nell enters.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell lowers her suitcase.\n\n<b>                               MRS. DUDLEY\n</b>                   The Purple Room.  You're going to \n                   be the first visitors that Hill \n                   House has had since Mister Crain \n                   died.\n\n     The room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief\n     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved\n     ivory.  A king-size bed, furniture, all in blue purple.  An open \n     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom.\n\n     A large fireplace dominates one wall.  Its mantle is carved with \n     the faces of children, happy, at play, alive.  Nell touches the \n     wood, loving.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   They're so beautiful.

You must love working \n                   here.\n\n     Mrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic:\n\n<b>                               MRS. DUDLEY\n</b>                   It's a job.  I keep banker's \n                   hours.  I set dinner on the dining \n                   room sideboard at six.  You can \n                   serve yourselves.  Breakfast is \n                   ready at nine.  I don't wait on \n                   people.  I don't stay after \n                   dinner.  Not after it begins to \n                   get dark.  I leave before dark \n                   comes.  We live in town.  Nine \n                   miles.  So there won't be anyone \n                   around if you need help.  We \n                   couldn't even hear you, in the \n                   night.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Why would we --\n\n<b>                               MRS.

In the \n                   night.  In the dark.\n\n     And with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes \n     the door after her.\n\n     Nell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She \n     goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  <u>The</u>\n     <u>sun is setting</u>.\n\n     Nell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a \n     blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still \n     on them.\n\n<b>     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves \n     away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like \n     the one to her room.\n\n     Trying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light\n     switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to --\n\n<b>     INT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain \n     for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and \n     slings them open.\n\n     The light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window \n     looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the \n     gravel.  Somebody else has arrived.\n\n     Nell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the \n     driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Finally.\n\n     She backs away from the window, spins around --\n\n     -- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh\n     Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second \n     floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late-\n     day sunlight.\n\n     Despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his\n     eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness.\n\n     Unconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the \n     end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third \n     set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as \n     it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it \n     swings silently shut.\n\n     But Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.\n\n<b>     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it?\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hello?\n\n     No response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster.\n\n     She passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears \n     the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet \n     of, where we thought we just saw it.\n\n     A WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind \n     her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very \n     human.\n\n<b>     INT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and\n     <b>THEO</b>, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with\n     a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an\n     amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   You may think I have a sickness \n                   about packing, but asking people \n                   to help me shlep the stuff I take \n                   with me everywhere is a cheap and \n                   exploitative way of making new \n                   friends.  My name's Theo.\n\n     Theo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's\n     been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down \n     to help with the bags.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me \n                   Nell.  Eleanor Vance.

Nell \n     watches Theo explore.  As Theo moves through the room, Nell's eye \n     lands on another painting of Hugh Crain.  Inside it's ornate golden \n     framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  Cherubs of \n     Death...

The figure is daunting, but \n     dead.  Just a painting.

They both disappear \n     into the dark gothic hallway.\n\n<b>     INT. SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK\n</b>\n     Theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains,\n     panelled walls, rich settees.  Other doors lead off the room.

You can \n                   do what you want.\n\n     Theo goes running for another door and is out.\n\n     Nell, realizing she's being left behind, springs after her into \n     another mysterious hallway --\n\n<b>     INT.

HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     Through a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly\n     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors \n     and chandeliers.  Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a\n     vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  With the door opening, there's \n     a CLICK, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  The FLOOR \n     begins to MOVE like a slow turntable.\n\n     Theo comes right up, looks over Nell's shoulder.  Nell steps out.\n\n     She traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing\n     with her into infinity.  Theo dances after her.  They dance, not \n     quite together.  Nell stops and pronounces:\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I love this house.

They take off running,\n     their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far \n     side of the room and out --\n\n<b>     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- into yet another hallway.  They race down the hall, turn into\n     another hall, then another, all dimly lit by the very last rays of\n     day, all furnished in the House's dark, impossibly complicated,\n     impossibly ornate fashion.  As they go, the mood is growing darker, \n     the women unaware that they are getting lost.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                          (having fun)\n                   Rats!

Nell and Theo \n     regard the darkness.\n\n     At the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS, closed,\n     almost black, oily-looking.  Surrounding them, an enormously complex\n     geometrical frieze.\n\n     The doors themselves are plain.  In their simplicity there is \n     something about them enormously disturbing.  It is as if the doors \n     are looking back at them, Nell goes cold.  Theo holds herself.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   We should go back.\n\n     Theo nods.

Crain's \n                   executors made good investments \n                   and for the last hundred and \n                   twenty years, Hill House has taken \n                   care of itself.\n\n     Mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring Marrow's request.\n     Everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.\n\n<b>                               TODD\n</b>                   So what's this study all about \n                   anyway?

The\n     painting of Hugh Crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right\n     behind.\n\n<b>                               LUKE\n</b>                   He said that Hugh Crain...

He \n                   told me that Crain drove his \n                   workers to early deaths.  Crain \n                   had children chained to the looms \n                   in his mill.

Personally, I don't \n                   think he's got a large enough \n                   sample for valid results, but as \n                   long as the money's good, and the \n                   food is good, I'm in.\n\n     He heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads \n     on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Nell, it was an accident.\n\n<b>     INT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Marrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder.  \n     His voice is cold, analytical.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Icebreaker exercise conducted over \n                   dinner.

Nell appears \n                   most susceptible to suggestive \n                   history.  Luke, who tested at the \n                   bottom of the Levy-Mogel \n                   Confidence Reliability Scale was \n                   given the second part of the \n                   story.  We should see some results \n                   tomorrow.  Accident with harp, \n                   while unfortunate... complements \n                   the experimental fiction.\n\n     He turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully:\n\n                               MARROW (cont'd)\n                   Publish or perish.\n\n     He turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for \n     him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his \n     head.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning \n     in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new\n     family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An \n     awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Ever try putting your hair up in a \n                   French twist?\n\n     Theo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell\n     realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Sorry.

Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Good night, Theo.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   You, too.

NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds \n     the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, \n     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but \n     staring OC where we sense Nell changing.\n\n     Now in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its\n     headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe \n     plants.\n\n     She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard.\n\n     Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it.\n     She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the \n     nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her \n     breathing --\n\n<b>     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     -- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on \n     the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in \n     darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things \n     that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the \n     very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES.\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     It is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on \n     the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear.\n     Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness.\n\n<b>     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Eyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long,\n     black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid.\n\n     At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double\n     doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.\n\n     That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as \n     if the House itself is breathing.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     BUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump.  \n     Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still \n     asleep, body moving by reflex.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Coming, Mother!\n\n     WHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY\n     REAL.  Nell remembers where she is.\n\n     Bump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell\n     listens in cold dread.\n\n<b>                               THEO (OC)\n</b>                   Nell!\n\n     Nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through --\n\n<b>     INT.

THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in \n     front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to\n     herself.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   What is it!?\n\n     The sound grows nearer.  Out in the hall.  Like something searching.\n     Coming toward them.\n\n     Nell lunges at the door.  Theo grabs to stop her, and Nell sees the\n     door is DEADBOLTED.  There's a RUSHING sound on the other side of \n     the tall door.  Right there.  Nell freezes.  BUMP!  BUMP!\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Nell!\n\n     Nell recoils to Theo's side, drags Theo out of bed to the corner of\n     the room.\n\n     Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.\n\n     Nell and Theo's eyes travel over the walls, following whatever it is\n     which now seems to be <u>moving out here in the theater</u>.\n\n     The SOUND moves along the wall to the right, reaching its loudest as\n     it crosses the back of the theater, then seems to come down the left\n     side.\n\n     Theo shivers.  Nell clutches her close.  Nell writhes, unable to \n     stand it any longer.  She jumps up.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Nell!\n\n     Nell charges the door, screaming:\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   No!\n\n     SILENCE.  The bumping goes dead.  Nell blinks, looks back at Theo.  \n     But Theo is looking at her hands.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it.\n\n     She looks up in horror at Nell.  Their breath FOGS in the air.  Nell\n     holds her hand up in front of her, and as we watch HER HAIR PRICKLES\n<b>     UP, GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM.\n</b>\n     Her eyes turn up to the door, and: BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM!  The DOOR\n     JARS in its frame, leaping from the blows of whatever's on the other\n     side.\n\n     Nell backpedals but slips on the rug, falls there on the floor right\n     in front of the door.  Theo SCREAMS.\n\n     Silence.  The BANGING stops.  With a RUSH, whatever is outside the \n     door is no longer there.\n\n     Nell looks at Theo.\n\n     Then Theo looks at the bathroom.\n\n     Nell starts for it, grabs Theo's door, but it's designed to be \n     locked from the BATHROOM SIDE.  Nell looks up --\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.  Theo appears in \n     the doorway behind her.  Across the bathroom the door to Nell's room \n     is closed.  Nell dashes for it --\n\n     -- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead.  On the other side \n     of the door.  Rasping over wood.  Like a thing without hands trying \n     to turn --\n\n     -- THE DOORKNOB.  A long beat.  The metal creaks as something takes \n     hold of it on the other side.\n\n     Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.  It's open.  \n     She's in no-man's land: too far from the door to lock it, too close \n     to run.\n\n     The doorknob TURNS, but just as the door starts to open NELL FLAILS\n<b>     FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME.\n</b>\n     The door jams against it.  Nell jumps back.  Theo grabs her back \n     into --\n\n<b>     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- her bedroom and slams the door.  A long, deadly silent moment.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   It's in my room.\n\n     But their BREATH no longer fogs.  Theo seems to notice the fact just \n     as Nell starts for her room and... KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  Behind them.  \n     At the door to the hall.\n\n<b>                               LUKE (OC)\n</b>                   Hey!

NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell's room stands silent, dark.  The door to the bathroom is shut.  \n     The lock slides open.  The door swings in.  Luke stands there, the \n     two women behind him.\n\n     Luke turns on the lights.  The room is perfectly ordinary, no sign \n     that anything has been in here.  The door to the hall is shut.  Nell \n     reacts.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell and Theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the\n     kitchen table.  Marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital\n     recorder.  Luke paces behind the women.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   You really didn't hear anything?\n\n     Marrow takes his glasses off.  Luke looks at him, then goes to the\n     kitchen sink.  He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up \n     against the sink, arms folded.  Theo and Nell turn to look at him.  \n     A beat.  And then:\n\n     BUMP.  Bump bump.  It's the sound.  Luke goes over to the door, \n     pushes it open.\n\n<b>                               LUKE\n</b>                   Oh, look!

A\n     rushing sound with it.  They're the same sounds, from the scene \n     before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as \n     they did in Theo's bedroom.\n\n<b>     INT.

That was the job I had, \n                   Theo, it's the only job I've ever \n                   known, and I failed.  I'm actually \n                   a bad person, Theo.  The world \n                   doesn't need me.\n\n     Theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  The confession, on the \n     top of the fright, has moved her deeply.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all \n                   due respect to your mother who I'm \n                   sure was a saint, I'd have called \n                   Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, \n                   for me.\n\n     It's such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile, and they share a\n     tearful laugh.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell stands in the door to her room.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Good night, Theo.\n\n     Nell shuts the door.  Theo is about to close her door, but \n     hesitates.  She puts on the light and goes to the tub.  She turns it \n     on, waits.  Just the sound of the water.  And no bumping.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the \n     bed.  HOVERING OVER HER, on the headboard, the carved faces of \n     children, peering DOWN.\n\n     FLAP.  FLAP flap.  The fan-light at the top of the window right next \n     to the bed is OPEN a crack.  The sheer curtains flap listlessly in a\n     gentle breeze.  The flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust \n     the curtain BILLOWS OUT.  In its flowing form, we sense the SHAPE OF \n     A GIRL'S FACE, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, \n     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us.\n\n     The CURTAIN blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of\n     the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them.  \n     The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows...\n\n     Nell sleeps, oblivious, the WIND filling the room, stirring the\n     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  The shape of the little\n     girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows,\n     toward Nell.\n\n     Nell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, \n     and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a\n     lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens.  \n     The crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, \n     we hear:\n\n<b>                               GIRL VOICE\n</b>                   <i>Find us, find us Eleanor.</i>\n\n     Nell's eyes open.  And like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air\n     rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone.\n\n     Nell sits up, looks about her.  Everything seems normal.  Just her\n     sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved\n     faces.  Benevolent.  Nell settles back down on her pillow with a \n     sense of peace.\n\n<b>     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     Morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on Marrow at \n     the dining table.  Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind \n     him to get at the coffee.  Nell wears MAKE UP, badly applied, and \n     her HAIR IS UP in a French twist.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Sorry.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   For an American you do a good \n                   imitation of the British at their \n                   most apologetic.\n                          (Veddy British)\n                   Pardon me.

He goes to the\n     sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.\n\n<b>                               LUKE\n</b>                   After I went to bed, the second \n                   time, after the... noise...

It looks \n                   good.\n\n     But she means exactly the opposite.  Marrow looks over Nell's hair, \n     but she can't stand it.  Luke comes over to the table, drops into a \n     chair next to Nell, digs into breakfast.  Theo's face turns into an\n     artificial smile.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Your makeup too.\n\n     Nell sits there flustered.  Marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite\n     sure what to make of it, and intervenes.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Eat your breakfast, Theo, then \n                   we'll get started on the tests.\n\n<b>     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY\n</b>\n     CLOSE ON the complex PUZZLE of a field-cognition test.  Nell \n     scratches solutions, erases, and finally looks up in frustration.  \n     She sits alone, tiny, in the murk of the vast vaulted Great Hall.  \n     The enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the room.\n\n     Clusters of furniture -- overwrought chairs with animal heads, \n     splay-footed coffee tables, limbed lamps -- huddle in strange, \n     silent covens throughout.  Nell, in a plush chair, lays the work on \n     a table beside her.  The CLATTER of stone on stone makes Nell look \n     up.\n\n     The fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs, large enough\n     for a man to stand in.  A piece of mortar must have come loose.  \n     Nell stares at the chimney.  And a VOICE lets out a loud groan.\n\n     Nell JUMPS.  She pops out of the chair.  It came from another circle \n     of furniture in the shadows.  A figure stands and comes over.  It's \n     Luke, stretching.\n\n                               LUKE (cont'd)\n                   I've been thinking about these \n                   carvings.  Kids.  Lots of kids.  \n                   Fat little angel kids.  Wild kids.  \n                   Kids with furry animals.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   The children.

We'll see.\n\n     He walks off, his footsteps echoing in the vast room.  The door \n     shuts after him.\n\n     Nell sags in her chair.  Then something catches her eye.  On a table\n     opposite, a SET OF KEYS.  Nell goes, picks them up.  Car keys, house\n     keys.  Must be Luke's.  She pockets them, thoughtful, but just as \n     she does --\n\n     -- something MOVES in the fireplace.  So fleeting Nell can barely \n     see it, and we only catch a frame of it.  But the iron MESH CURTAIN \n     hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING.\n\n     Nell stands there FROZEN.  The massive fireplace LOOMS before her, \n     like a monstrous mouth, black as pitch beyond the black metal \n     curtains.\n\n     The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor.  Its eerie, repetitive\n     screep cutting to the nerve.\n\n     Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.\n\n     A SINGLE STRAND of NELL'S HAIR stirs toward the fireplace, and --\n\n<b>     -- SOMETHING INSIDE THE FIREPLACE MOVES BEHIND THE MESH!\n</b>\n     Nell CRASHES back over her chair, knocking over a lamp and table,\n     tripping, stumbling out of the furniture.\n\n     Holy shit.  Whatever moved in there was real.  Big, dark, like\n     something's head.  It goes out of focus and we can't see it as we\n     follow --\n\n     -- NELL flying away, across the room in headlong terror.\n\n<b>     INT. FOYER - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell slams out of the room, skidding as the door slams behind her.  \n     She sways up off the floor to run --\n\n     -- right into Marrow and Theo's legs.  Nell aborts a scream, \n     realizing who it is.  Theo stands there in surprise, holding papers \n     in her hand.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   There's someone in there!

Theo glances at Nell.  Nell is shaken.\n\n     Marrow nods to Luke, and they start forward together, Marrow among \n     the furniture to the left, Luke down the right side.\n\n     The iron screens hang silent in the fireplace, black, impenetrable.\n     Marrow and Luke come up on either side, Luke ducking this way and \n     that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh.\n\n     They stop before it, neither breathing, both listening.  Marrow \n     steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in.  \n<b>     DARKNESS.\n</b>\n     Nell and Theo watch, apprehensive.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Jim...\n\n     Marrow sticks his head into the fireplace.  For a long moment, \n     nothing happens.\n\n     IN THE FIREPLACE: pitch darkness.  Marrow feels up the chimney.\n\n     AND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!  Marrow\n     doesn't flinch.\n\n     He FLINGS back the screen, revealing the only things in the \n     fireplace: two massive andirons, and the still-swinging FLUE.  It's \n     cast-iron, forged in the shape of a LION'S HEAD.\n\n     Luke throws back the other screen.  Theo comes over.  Nell follows.\n     There's nothing else in the fireplace.\n\n     Luke and Theo stare at Nell.  Marrow squats to study the hearth.  \n     The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot.\n\n     Not a mark on it.  He opens it.  Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and \n     CHARRED WOOD.  Marrow stands, looks at Nell.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Somebody was in here.  I saw him.\n\n     Marrow looks at her, not sure what to believe.  Nell turns to Luke \n     and Theo for help.  Not from that corner.  Then Nell remembers, \n     reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.  She holds them up to \n     Luke.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Are these yours?

HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell and Theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors,\n     checking rooms.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   David?\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Maybe he never came in.

Or maybe \n                   he got here early, and went for a \n                   walk, and fell.  Maybe he's \n                   outside.\n\n     Nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead.  Staring.\n\n     The shut, dark, door, the one that scared Nell and Theo earlier,\n     awaits them at the end.  Ominous.\n\n     Nell approaches.  Closer and closer.  The door nears.\n\n     Nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the \n     door.  It's locked.  Her BREATH FOGS THE AIR.  She doesn't notice \n     it.  But then she suddenly GAGS.  With a look of horror she recoils \n     from the door, choking, covering her face.\n\n     Then Theo smells it.  The women are both sick from the smell.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the \n                   smell... ohhh.\n\n     Marrow comes into the hallway.  He sees them from a distance.\n\n     ON the two women.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                          (looks to Nell for \n                           an answer)\n                   Is it over?\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   No, it's getting worse.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Nell!

She smells it too, and in mirror \n     image fashion backs away from the doors also.  Marrow notices the \n     exchange, and watches them, intense.  And then, in a heartbeat, the \n     moment is over.\n\n<b>     EXT. VERANDA - DAY\n</b>\n     The RED LIGHT on Marrow's DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks.  The device \n     is in Marrow's jacket pocket, CONCEALED from Nell.  They're sitting \n     in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House.  Marrow, \n     beside her, observes.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   What did it smell like?\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   It was very specific.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                          (so tell me...)\n                   All right...\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   In the bathroom in my mother's \n                   room, the toilet was next to an \n                   old wooden table.

With longing.  Marrow looks at\n     her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment \n     lasts a few heartbeats.\n\n     He looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then \n     she realizes Marrow is looking at --\n\n     -- Luke.\n\n                               LUKE (cont'd)\n                   You have to see something.\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY\n</b>\n     Luke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find\n     Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She \n     turns and looks at Nell strangely.\n\n     Nell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark\n     stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from \n     the roof has run down.\n\n     Nell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back\n     farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   My name.\n\n     She follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as\n     more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.

Hugh's face \n     is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas \n     glares out... like a skull.\n\n     Nell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in \n     alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and \n     we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH \n     LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it.\n\n<b>     INT.

The air stirs her hair.  She peers up at the House's \n     roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like \n     so many screaming heads.\n\n     Chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.

Vines and trees climb up the sides.  Beds \n     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick.\n\n     Nell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A MAN\n     bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been\n     drowning.  A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  And A\n     CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUE'S mouth surprising Nell.\n     She lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with Marrow.\n\n     Nell loves the greenhouse.  It takes her breath away.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Oh... it's so beautiful...\n\n     Nell makes her way among the plants.  She looks up at a TOWERING,\n     DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform \n     which gives access to the roof.

While she talks, she walks, and Marrow\n     follows.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I was just thinking how happy I am \n                   right now.  All my life, I've been \n                   waiting for an adventure.  And I \n                   thought, oh, I'll never have that, \n                   adventures are for people who \n                   travel long distances, that's for \n                   soldiers, that's for the women \n                   that the bullfighters fall in love \n                   with.  And here I am, and \n                   something is happening to me.  \n                   Strange noises in the night.  \n                   Paintings are calling to me.  And \n                   all it cost to get there was five \n                   gallons of gas.  I'm getting my \n                   adventure.\n\n     For the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her\n     which is simply... erotic.  Marrow follows her down one of the\n     footpaths.  She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her.  She reaches \n     a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the\n     slightest sway to her gait.  Marrow follows her around the corner \n     into the transept.  At the far end the wall is completely overgrown.\n\n     Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim \n     outside, distorted in the old glass.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Someone is playing with you.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Why?\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   I don't know.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   It doesn't matter.  Even if \n                   they're tormenting me, someone \n                   wants me.  What I do with this is \n                   up to me.  I can be a victim, or I \n                   can be a volunteer.  And I want to \n                   be the volunteer.\n\n     Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, \n     passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, \n     powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at \n     her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the \n     hanging vines, pulls them aside...\n\n     ...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an \n     involuntary step back, a little gasp.\n\n     The face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a\n     STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over.\n\n     It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The\n     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence\n     from the greenhouse.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get \n                   away from him.\n\n     She laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull \n     the plants back to reveal more of it.\n\n     She reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and\n     begins to hum her TUNE.\n\n     Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh\n     Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   What is that tune?\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I don't know.  A lullaby I guess.  \n                   My mother used to hum it to me.  \n                   And her mother before that, and so \n                   on.\n                          (to the statue)\n                   Hugh Crain, would you care to \n                   dance?\n\n     She hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS \n     OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares.  \n     Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring \n     at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, \n     embarrassed, can't bear to look at him.\n\n     A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns\n     back --\n\n     -- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps\n     echoing in the vaulted room.\n\n<b>     EXT. REAR LAWN - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at\n     herself as much as she is spooked.\n\n     In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of\n     paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses \n     her, pauses, and smiles.\n\n     Nell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the\n     House.\n\n     Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her\n     shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --\n\n<b>     EXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small\n     swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates.\n\n     Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight\n     small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in \n     the grass: stillbirths.\n\n     Nell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S.  \n     The smaller ones are her children's.\n\n     Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names.\n     One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is\n     covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Only two days.\n\n     There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to \n     read it.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   The blest are the dead / Who see \n                   not the sight / Of their own \n                   desolation...\n\n     Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the\n     gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She\n     clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here:\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   A father's joy unjustly snatch'd \n                   by a jealous God...\n\n     Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the\n     one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away \n     -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so\n     comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise:\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Suffer the little children unto \n                   me.\n\n     There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the \n     brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a \n     day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a \n     cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of \n     the cemetery, afraid.\n\n<b>     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the \n     Red Parlor.\n\n<b>     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY\n</b>\n     She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of\n     books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at \n     Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate \n     frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then \n     recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN.  \n     Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and \n     is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell...\n\n<b>     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY\n</b>\n     Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room.  \n     Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing \n     through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a \n     late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office.\n\n     The bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers \n     are stamped with the cherub of death.\n\n     At the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair\n     covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from\n     underneath.  Nell realizes it's:\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Crain's study.\n\n     She moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner \n     surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, \n     and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front \n     of it, blocking our view.\n\n     And when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the\n     chair, the natural shadow of the room.\n\n     Nell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent\n     behind her, shrouded.\n\n     On the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names -- Lowell,\n     Haverhill, Manchester -- and years: 1884, '85 and so on.  She flips \n     one open.\n\n     THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers \n     rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the \n     column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate \n     wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are \n     children.\n\n     NELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair\n     behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone \n     could be sitting there under it.\n\n     She turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one \n     column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is \n     unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through \n     them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS.\n\n     Nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger.\n\n     She turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed\n     column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth.  \n     The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their \n     names...\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and \n                   Elizabeth... who are you?  And \n                   you?  What happened to you?  You \n                   died... How did you die?\n\n     Nell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores.\n\n     Nell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We \n     see the book.\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     We see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap.\n     Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo \n     looks at the book with her.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   That's so sad.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   There's hundreds of them.

Nell takes it, tops off her glass,\n     spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big\n     swallow.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   You really think it was Luke?\n\n     Theo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next \n     to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Well, it wasn't me.

Nell sighs.\n\n     Theo lowers her face near Nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near,\n     red.  She blows.\n\n     Nell raises herself up, peers down at Theo.  Sees the want on her \n     face.  A long beat.\n\n     Nell breaks the gaze, looks away.  Theo reads Nell's look, and \n     releases her foot.  She sits back in the chair.  For a moment Nell \n     doesn't know what to do.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   I better go to bed.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Are you sure?\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   I think so.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Okay.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair \n     for bed.  Her motions are languid in the light of the single small \n     lamp, off-balance with the wine.\n\n     Her HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through\n     it, lifting it and letting it fall.\n\n     IN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, \n     the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it.\n\n     Nell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush\n     through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from \n     her head.\n\n     Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time\n     the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT.\n\n     Nell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on\n     the vanity a-wobbling.\n\n     She's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at\n     the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat.\n\n     She steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control.\n\n     The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering.  \n     The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And \n     something there catches her eye.\n\n     Nell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing.\n     Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very\n     highest edge of hearing.\n\n     She stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the\n     rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens.  \n     The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE.\n\n     Nell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to\n     rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the\n     FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... \n     to awe.\n\n     Tentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle.\n\n     It is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the \n     FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands\n     outstretched for her, hopeful.\n\n<b>     EXT.

HILL HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze\n     curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of \n     other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in \n     a face howling in horror.\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, \n     asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed.\n\n     In the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the\n     faint light from the window.  HOLD on it.\n\n     Silently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark\n     beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND.  \n     Something drags itself across the floor.\n\n     BUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the \n     sound is getting louder, coming closer.\n\n     Bump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the \n     blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH \n<b>     BEGINS TO FOG.\n</b>\n     Whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC.\n     We can feel it.\n\n     Without warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness.\n     REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN.\n\n     Nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She \n     breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with \n     her.\n\n     She stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment.  \n     Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers.\n\n     They are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and\n     looks down.\n\n     HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell\n<b>     SCREAMS.\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

Perplexed, Nell finds the key in the \n     hole, and turns it.\n\n     The door rams open, Theo behind it, terrified and clearly just \n     awoken.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Nell...\n\n     Nell stares at her, hair tangled, tear-stained, doubtful.  Water\n     splashes in the tub, faucets still running.\n\n     The LIGHTS flicker as one in the connecting rooms.  Theo has time to\n     look up at the bulb in the bathroom, and they all GO OUT.  Darkness\n     swallows them up.  Stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror \n     silhouettes them standing there.\n\n                               THEO (cont'd)\n                   Nell, the tub!\n\n     Nell stoops in the darkness and the faucets squeak shut.  Theo bumps\n     her way out of the room.  Nell moves to the doorway following her\n     into --\n\n<b>     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     -- Theo's room.  Theo's form moves by her bed, and with a snick, her\n     cigarette lighter lights up.  Theo holds it above her head, its tiny\n     orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows.  Nell \n     steps toward her.\n\n     Drip.  Drip.  From the bathroom.

Their breath.\n\n     Nell shakes her head: don't say anything.  Nell turns around, the\n     darkness almost impenetrable.  SHAPES, alien, threatening, at the \n     very edge of light -- anyone could be some... thing.  Drip.

Nell gives the bed a wide berth.  Together they back toward \n     the wall with the fireplace.\n\n     They stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid.  Behind them \n     looms the fireplace and in front of it, a metal cage-like fire \n     screen.  A beat.\n\n     BAM!  SOMETHING LUNGES out of the fireplace but is caught in the\n     screen, hitting Nell and Theo in the back.\n\n     Theo's lighter goes flying in that very instant, and we never see\n     what's hit the screen.  Neither do they.  Theo falls SCREAMING.  \n     Nell manages to whirl, embrace the cage and slam it with whatever's \n     inside back into the fireplace.  The screen JOLTS hard enough to \n     lift Nell.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b><b>                   HELP!\n</b>\n     Theo still SCREAMING, lying on her back before the fireplace, rams \n     her feet against it.  The screen HAMMERS at Nell and Theo.  They \n     can't run or it'll get out.\n\n     Theo's screaming is suddenly drowned out by a HORRIFYING, INHUMAN\n     SOUND from inside the fireplace.\n\n     Theo's scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror.

And then all the air in \n     the room seems to be SUCKED into the fireplace in one THUMP.  The \n     door to the bathroom slams.\n\n     It's gone.  They sit there in the darkness, panting.\n\n<b>     INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT DAY\n</b>\n     Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain.  In the morning light it\n     seems inert, cold, just a statue.

It's open to a faded, gray image taken long \n     before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, \n     RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair.\n\n     And standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat,\n     his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN.\n\n     Nell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own.\n\n     An image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces.  \n     The page flips.\n\n     Crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face \n     is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through \n     Nell.\n\n     The album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, PAGES \n     FLIP, Rene's SMILE grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit \n     with grinning insanity...\n\n     Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf.\n\n     It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain, alone, in front of \n     the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall.  RENE IS GONE.  The photo \n     is monstrous.  Nell, fearful, turns the page --\n\n     -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.  A picture of a lovely\n     woman filled with grace and power.  CAROLYN CRAIN.  Posed.  On a \n     settee before the fireplace.  Beautiful beyond words.  Smiling.  \n     Ahead of her time.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   His second wife.  There was a \n                   second wife?  Carolyn.\n\n     It warms Nell.\n\n     She turns the page.  Now Crain is there beside Carolyn.  But there \n     is something different about him.  Less frightening.\n\n     Nell flips the page again, and now there is an image of Crain and\n     Carolyn.  Her hair is up in a FRENCH TWIST.  Nell smiles more.\n\n     Nell turns the page yet again.\n\n     <u>But something is wrong</u>.  It is another image of Carolyn and the\n     kinder, gentler Crain, but now it is Carolyn who is unsmiling.\n\n     Another page.  Another.  Carolyn's face darkening.  And in this \n     picture, Carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   She was pregnant.\n\n     Nell TURNS PAGES FASTER AND FASTER, and as she does, Carolyn SWELLS\n     PREGNANT before our eyes in ragged animation, mouth working as if to\n     speak, voiceless as it is... ELEANOR.\n\n     Nell fumbles the book onto the floor.  It stares up at her, open to \n     the last page.\n\n     It is an image of Carolyn.  Betrayal.  Hell.  Knowledge.  Her hand \n     seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE.\n\n     Nell bolts from the room.\n\n<b>     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops.  At the far end of the \n     room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the \n     veil to some hellish sanctuary.\n\n     Nell stares at it, daunted.  What is it that Carolyn is trying to \n     show her?  The fireplace beckons, and Nell approaches against her \n     will.\n\n     She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down.\n     She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  She steps into\n     its soot-black mouth.\n\n     Nell peers up the chimney.  A faint sigh of air.  She sticks the \n     poker up the flue, scratches around.  Nothing.\n\n     She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it.\n     Sooty stone chips away, but it's solid.\n\n     The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  Nell grabs the \n     heavy, iron lever.  She pulls, but can barely budge it.  It finally \n     screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace \n<b>     SWINGS DOWN.\n</b>\n     Nell looks in.  Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a\n     charred timber or two sticking out.  Sick with fear, Nell prods the\n     ash.  Just charred wood.\n\n     She thrusts the poker down deep.  It vanishes in the ash up to her\n     hand.  CLACK.  She rakes through the ash.  CLACK.  And then she \n     feels the poker take purchase.  She draws it out, and full of dread \n     turns it to the light...\n\n     Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS.\n\n     Nell fights back the scream in her throat.  One of the skulls is a\n     child's skull, the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow, \n     forehead crushed.\n\n     Nell lets the poker drop.  It bangs off the door, falls in the ash\n     drop, its handle hitting a spring.  Nell recoils as the trapdoors \n     SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws.\n\n<b>     INT. GROUND HALLWAY FLOOR - DUSK\n</b>\n     Nell stumbles down the hall, weeping in fear.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Theo!  Jim!  Help!\n\n     But instead she hears children voices, calling out for her.\n\n<b>     INT. CONFUSING SERIES OF ROOMS (THE MAZE) - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell winds through the pitch-dark halls, rooms gaping black left and\n     right, searching for the voices which seems to come from just around\n     the next bend, leading her around corner after corner.\n\n     The hallways peel past Nell as she runs, slamming through doors, \n     ever darker.  The House's hellish carvings glare as she passes, \n     grinning, taunting.  She rages on, oblivious until she rounds a \n     final corner --\n\n<b>     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     -- into the long, dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM.  The \n     STATUARY peer down on her.  Dead faces.  Blind marble eyes.  As she \n     turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her.\n\n     For a frame or two the EYES are real, just a subliminal glimmer.  \n     For the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't\n     there.  It makes Nell stop.  She regards the terrible doors.  She\n     considers the labyrinth around her.  And begins to understand.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   The house... it's a maze, that's \n                   how you designed it, didn't you, \n                   Mister Crain?  So wherever one of \n                   your little guests went, the house \n                   brought them here.  It's designed \n                   to make you come here.  But why?\n\n     Another CRY comes from the far end.\n\n     Nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a \n     tide.  She hesitates, but then the CHILD-CRY forces her on.  She \n     reaches the CARVED DOORS with the wooden guard statues.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no... \n                   not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh!\n\n     Gaping cold and stench hit her.  She gags.\n\n     Now the CRY comes from under the door.  Present.  Real.  Right \n     there.  Nell shudders.\n\n     The CRY grows louder, desperate.  She shuts her ears to it.  The CRY\n     rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore.  Not\n     sounding like anything human at all, it's painful.  Nell looks at \n     the locked room in horror and takes off running.\n\n<b>     INT. PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK\n</b>\n     Nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  Standing there are\n     Marrow, Theo and Luke, stricken silent by her entry.  Looks of shock \n     on their faces.  Nell just stands there.  A beat.  And then it pours \n     out of her, hysterical.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   He hunted all those children in \n                   here.

Before anyone else can react, \n     her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.

Mass hysteria is \n                   like a story, Nell.  A communal \n                   story.  Someone starts it.

LONG, LOW, like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen\n     madmen.  Nell stirs.  Her eyes open.  She hears the sound.\n\n     The wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom \n     from the window.  The twisting figures in the plaster, the low-\n     relief, the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE.  \n     Black.  Not human.  The woodwork around it like some half-face.\n\n     The GIBBERING begins to RISE.\n\n     OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the \n     bed.\n\n     Nell's mouth moves.

It's a wail of \n     agony.  A wail not of this earth.  Nell struggles, racked between \n     the pain in her hand and the tortured child's cry.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   A child.  No.  No!

And with sudden\n     violence, she's WRENCHED out of the bed by whatever's beside her.  \n     Nell hits the floor with a scream.  She grabs at the table on this \n     side of the bed, pulling a lamp down on her, yanking at its chain.\n\n     The room FLASHES into brilliance.  Nell stands up, panting... There \n     is nothing in the room.  No Theo.  She looks at her hand.\n\n     The eye on the wall is gone.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand?\n\n     Nell snaps around.  There on the window, SPREADING before her eyes \n     the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE.  The face \n     of CRAIN.\n\n     Nell recoils in prickling fear.  Living fear.  Then her fear turns \n     to RAGE.  In the blink of an eye there's a heavy ashtray in her \n     hand, and it's flying at the window.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   I will not let you hurt a CHILD!\n\n     The window BASHES out into the night, the face vanishing with a HOWL\n     of air.\n\n<b>     INT.

Marrow's cellular phone falls \n     out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor.\n\n     The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling.\n     Nell grips the railing at the top.\n\n     Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below.\n     He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.

She looks down at the tangled steel below...\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   The children want me.  They're \n                   calling me.

As she has reached out to \n     him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, \n     and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she \n     slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs \n     on.\n\n     A moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP\n     POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the\n     stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic\n     shattering of sound.\n\n     Marrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his\n     shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't \n     open them.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   We're going down the stairs, Nell, \n                   I'm taking you down the stairs.\n\n     He leads her go down the stairs.\n\n<b>     INT.

Nell lies \n     in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke \n     finishes, comes over.

She's sensitive, \n                   she's vulnerable, but I don't \n                   think she's suicidal and I didn't \n                   have to test her.  Maybe she \n                   wasn't trying to kill herself.  \n                   Maybe she was really scared.  \n                   Maybe she really heard voices.\n\n     Marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.

Marrow is slouched in a chair.\n\n     Luke settles back against the wall.\n\n     The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy \n     field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep.\n\n<b>     INT.

She lies\n     there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing\n     something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see \n     it in the cold.\n\n<b>     INT.

NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.\n     From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone \n     is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the \n     room.\n\n     The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE\n     MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside\n     out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings \n     changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with \n     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see.\n\n     The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall\n     bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy \n     baroque curves, swelling them...\n\n     The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell.  \n     Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES \n     grow, side by side.\n\n     From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the\n     fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide.\n\n     Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on.  \n     The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO \n     SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES.\n\n     Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the\n     ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful\n     transformation of the ceiling is clear.\n\n     It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids \n     sealing shut its blind face.\n\n     Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying \n     to call out.\n\n     The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat.\n\n<b>     INT.

As the room lowers itself toward her, she\n     SCREAMS out of her mind.\n\n<b>     INT.

It splinters out of its frame --\n\n<b>     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\n     -- and stumble into Nell's room.  Marrow's mouth opens.  Luke stands\n     speechless.  They're stricken by the sight: Nell SCREAMING, held by \n     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room \n     THRUSTING at her rhythmically.  Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Oh, Jesus.\n\n     Marrow recovers, reaches out for Nell, and the FACE in the ceiling\n     turns on him.  The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks.  He looks up \n     into it and knows it's real.  Somehow, it is Crain.\n\n     Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and\n     SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra.\n     Nell screams in surprise, but Theo drags her out of the bed.\n\n     The head turns to them.  They flee.  Marrow backs away in awe and \n     fear.\n\n<b>     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall.  Marrow\n     brings up the rear.

Marrow's hand still outstretched.  Nell looks\n     around the room.  There are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads,\n     humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything.\n     All turning to her.\n\n     Theo looks around, but can't see what Nell is seeing.  Nell's breath\n     comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   They're all in here.  All the ones \n                   he killed.

Why are we waiting?\n\n     Even now, Marrow can't believe what he just saw, but Theo's voice\n     brings him back.  He whirls, grabs onto Nell, helps Theo drag her \n     out.\n\n<b>     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill \n     House as possible.  Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the \n     road beyond leading out of this place, so close...\n\n     Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  No\n     easy way under it.  He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes\n     twenty feet up.

He struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  Sparks jump \n     from the battery.  Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the \n     shattered window.

THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Marrow comes out of the bathroom, joining Theo by the window next to\n     her bed.  Luke stands in the doorway.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Was sure she'd be in here.\n\n<b>                               LUKE\n</b>                          (worried)\n                   Where in the hell can she be.\n\n     Marrow remembers.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Oh no...\n\n<b>     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Marrow, Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth\n     forbidding in the darkness.  They spread out on the parallel \n     walkways.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Nell?\n\n     They reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at\n     the end looming white in the dusk.\n\n     Dead silence.  Then Marrow SCREAMS.\n\n     Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes\n     from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him\n     there forever.  Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Oh my God it's Watts.\n\n     As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a \n     river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  Their clothes \n     splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there.\n\n<b>     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room,\n     turning... and kicking something on the floor.\n\n     It is a wooden toy train.  Then she sees a rocking horse by her \n     feet.  It is a NURSERY.  Turn-of-the-century.\n\n     And as Nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here \n     in the dark, she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES.\n\n     Against the wall.  A bed covered in a sheet.  A table beside it.  A \n<b>     HAND BELL.  A CANE.\n</b>\n     <u>Just like Nell's sick room at home</u>.  Nell realizes it, covers her\n     mouth.\n\n     The furniture is in EXACTLY the same position, though the sheets\n     covering the pieces are stained, FAR OLDER.\n\n     And on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of\n     sheet.\n\n     Nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  For a long\n     beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  Understanding.\n\n     The framed thing is a stitchery.  It says: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING,\n<b>     EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.\n</b>\n     Just like the one at home.\n\n<b>     INT.

Turns around.  \n     The men notice, and pause.\n\n     Then they hear it.  Faint.  Floating down from upstairs somewhere.\n     Nell's TUNE.  It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's\n     coming from so far away.\n\n     They look at each other, start for the stairs.\n\n<b>     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Theo, Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  They \n     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  The tune \n     is coming from within.  Abruptly, it stops.\n\n     And instead of Nell's tune, there's a repetitive CREAK.  CREAK.  \n<b>     CREAK.\n</b>\n     In rising dread, Theo starts forward.\n\n     It takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her.  The CREAKING \n     gets louder, unnerving.\n\n     They get to the doors, Theo first.  She pushes them wide.\n\n<b>     INT.

She lowers the needle to the spinning \n     record.  And HER TUNE, the one she hums all the time, begins to \n     play.\n\n     The others are frozen where they stand.  Marrow's mind reels at the\n     implications of what he's hearing.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   No.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   My mother used to hum this to me.  \n                   Like her mother hummed it to her.  \n                   And my great grandmother Carolyn \n                   hummed it to her.\n\n     Nell turns back.

Marrow sweeps\n     past Theo, grabs Nell hard, and swings her for the door.\n\n<b>                               MARROW\n</b>                   Come on.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   No --\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Please, Nell, just see us out.\n\n     Luke closes in on Nell with Marrow, and there's nothing she can do \n     but let herself be pulled along.\n\n<b>     INT.

And then CREEEEAK.  \n     They cast their eyes back up the stairs.\n\n     BUMP BUMP.  Far-off sounds, hair-raising, of infinite variety, carry\n     down the halls.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   ...In the dark.\n\n     Luke rushes from the room.\n\n<b>     INT.

But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in \n     it.\n\n     Marrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat.  They hustle over to it.  \n     Theo and Nell stand a few feet back.\n\n     Luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal.  \n     Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some \n     sort of handle on the other side.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Hurry!\n\n     Theo watches the door behind them.

Marrow moans, and Nell\n     grips his injured hand in hers.  Fast, like she was born a trauma\n     doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Give me your shoelace.\n\n     Marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell.

As the \n     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is \n     utter silence.\n\n<b>     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Luke looks at them helplessly.

Luke falls on his stomach.\n\n     Stunned, Luke looks straight into Nell's eyes.  Then the carpet \n     slides fast for the FIREPLACE.  It whips up to the hearth and sends \n     Luke flying through the chain curtains.\n\n     The others are speechless.  They can do nothing but watch as Luke \n     lays there on the ashdrop.  A long moment.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                          (to the house, to\n                           Crain)\n                   No!  No!

Luke looks \n     back into its iron eyes --\n\n     -- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's\n     head off his body.\n\n     The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet \n     with its strings cut.\n\n     Nell, Marrow and Theo stand there.  Not sure of what just happened,\n     their minds unable to accept it.\n\n     A sound comes up in Theo's throat.  A sob.  A horrified whimper.  \n     Marrow and Nell stand there speechless.

The room inhales and \n     exhales, the bumping sound resumes.  A rumble runs through the house \n     and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud \n     of ashes still hangs in the air.\n\n     Unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them.\n     The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more, \n     but Nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and \n     she will fight it...\n\n     She suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches \n     out for Marrow and Theo, pull them out of the way as the giant \n     painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them.  It \n     misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes.\n\n     Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the GRIFFIN\n     on top of the staircase.\n\n     For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them, comes alive,\n     opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but Nell sees \n     the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   No, no, you leave them alone!\n\n     And the griffin turns back into brass.  Marrow and Theo unaware of \n     what happened behind them.  They have to get out of there.\n\n<b>     INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Nell leads Marrow and Theo down the dark hallway, the twisted \n     woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, \n     trip someone, grab a sleeve.\n\n     It is a nightmare House.  Doing what it was made for.\n\n     The BUMPING they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the\n     ceiling.  It gives chase, on the floor above.  Nell keeps looking \n     back, and every time she does the BUMPING seems to get more firm, \n     MORE LIKE A FOOTSTEP.  Calm, Nell urges them on.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Hurry.\n\n     The FOOTSTEPS upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving \n     better, more naturally.\n\n     Theo and Marrow turn LEFT through an archway.  Nell looks back at \n     the ceiling.  The thing's moving fast.\n\n     She dodges toward the archway where Theo and Marrow went, and STOPS.\n     It's a wall.  Solid wall.  There's no archway here!  Nell backs \n     away.  Alone.\n\n     The House has separated them.\n\n     Nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked.\n     There's no other way then going back.\n\n<b>     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY\n</b>\n     Nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over Crain's \n     painting.  The long white lace curtains in front of a side window \n     start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed!\n\n     Nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, \n     calls out:\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Jim!  Theo!\n\n     No answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the\n     CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a\n     split second, the image of CRAIN, GRABBING for her.\n\n     Nell, oblivious, steps just OUT OF REACH, and as the breeze fails, \n     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into \n     chaos.  Nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at \n     the open window.\n\n     She turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends \n     and walks down the steps.\n\n<b>     INT. GRAND STAIRCASE/GREAT HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase.\n\n     Behind Nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their\n     eyes as Nell enters the great hall.  And they cower in fear for what \n     is about to happen.  Again Nell call's out for Theo and Marrow.\n\n     And Nell doesn't see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that fold \n     out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as Nell\n     carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children \n     that cover the floor.\n\n     Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair\n     after she passes.  We're screaming as they almost have her... and \n     Nell steps away.\n\n     And then... CREAK... CREAK... CREAK...\n\n     The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in\n     fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly.\n\n     Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness \n     to what is now coming down the stairs.\n\n     The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing\n     coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the\n     landing.  The sound stops.\n\n     Nell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to\n     the floor in the Grand Entry.\n\n     Darkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded\n     frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat.\n\n     And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening \n     the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down \n     them.\n\n     Before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, \n     flickers into existence:\n\n     THE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the\n     proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders \n     stooped.  And just like that, all it is...\n\n     ...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know \n     for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of \n     shadow.\n\n     Nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful\n     presence.  She is spellbound.\n\n     BANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow \n     come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall \n     beyond.\n\n     In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see \n     it, have their backs turned.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b>                   Nell!  There you --\n\n     But Nell is looking past them.  They see her face and turn around.\n\n<b>                               NELL\n</b>                   Nooo, not them!\n\n     What is coming at them makes the blood stop.\n\n     The Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the\n     pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its \n     wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS:\n\n     Theo SCREAMS.  Marrow stumbles back.  And then Nell's voice rings \n     out:\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Is this where she bashed your \n                   brains in?\n\n     The onrushing presence STOPS.  Seems to turn its attention to Nell,\n     standing there before the towering front doors.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   When you came in the door?  I bet \n                   that was the last thing you \n                   expected.  Right?  From <u>Carolyn</u>?\n                          (beat)\n                   You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've \n                   taken it all out of her, you \n                   thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no \n                   threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma \n                   Carolyn.  Did you know that?\n\n     Nell shows no fear.  There's a ferocious edge to her voice.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   She found out what you did, and \n                   she knew there was only one way to \n                   stop you.  And she stopped you, so \n                   you couldn't torture anymore of \n                   the living.\n                          (beat)\n                   But you wouldn't even let go of \n                   the dead, would you?  Well, now \n                   I'm here.  They called me.  Did \n                   you know that?  They've been \n                   crying out for help for a long \n                   time.  And I heard them.\n\n     She points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great Hall.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   And I won't let you hurt them \n                   anymore.\n\n     The SHAPE hovers there, silent.  Air and shadow distort around it.  \n     The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back and \n     forth, alive then not-alive.  Pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try \n     to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work.\n\n                               NELL (cont'd)\n                   Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what \n                   to do.  We've both been here \n                   before.\n\n     The SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD, knocking everyone out of their seats.  It\n     flies across the floor at Nell.\n\n     Marrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way.\n\n     Nell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE.\n\n     It's ON HER, but just as it seems to hit, it SPLITS like she went\n     right through it.  The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake IMPACTS\n     deep in the enormous doors.\n\n     The carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning.  \n     And then all the SCREAMS are cut off.\n\n     Nell stands there with her arms spread.  A long moment.\n\n     She opens her eyes.\n\n     And then the woodwork LASHES OUT, grabs her from behind, slams her\n     back against the doors.  THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER.\n\n     We feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork.\n\n     And for a few seconds Nell's body just hangs there... and then it\n     gently falls down.\n\n     Theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell.\n\n<b>                               THEO\n</b><b>                   NELL!\n</b>\n     Marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his \n     beliefs changed forever.  He walks over to Nell and feels her pulse, \n     knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell.\n\n     And as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new \n     carving in the sculpted doors.  It is a woman and as we move in we \n     can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell...\n\n<b>     INT. HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS, ENTRY - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n     The HOUSE INHALES.  And BOOM!\n\n     The front doors blast wide.  Every door in the entry slams open.\n\n<b>     EXT. HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n     Against the early light of a rising sun, the silhouette of Hill \n     House. Every window and every door in the House is open, each and \n     every one CRYING OUT with a different, unintelligible voice, like a \n     soul, the soul of a child, escaping from each one.\n\n<b>     EXT.

This could be shot in an old press in England, or a\n     foundry, with a few pieces of equipment to suggest a press.  There \n     are stacks of books.  This is the printing press in Hell.  The NOISE \n     is deafening.\n\n     The title of the book: FEAR AND PERFORMANCE.\n\n     Marrow stands before a mountain of copies of the book.
