Eerie.\n    Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of\n    distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.\n\n    Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200\n    Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109\n    fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar\n    that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the\n    massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters\n    roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors\n    come to rest and, needing no introduction:\n\n    ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by\n    the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.\n\n    (Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire\n    sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         2.\n</b>\n\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,\n    but they are pushed back by SS guards. The F\u00fchrer\n    marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or\n    their waiting limo.\n\n    To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto\n    the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the\n    windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.\n    Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.\n\n<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>           It's not so much your car he\n           doesn't trust... It's your driver.\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:\n\n<b>    TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER\n</b><b>    OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.\n</b>\n    The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in           \n    a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops               \n    into the limo they brought for Hitler.                          \n\n    Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A\n    beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.\n\n\n<b>3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3\n</b>\n    Est.

The room falls silent.\n\n    HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the\n    F\u00fchrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.\n    We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he\n    places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,\n    deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.\n    When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of\n    the room relaxes slightly and digs in.\n\n    ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow\n    and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,\n    eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.              \n    Tresckow stares.                                                \n<b>\n</b><b>                                                        3.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                         TRESCKOW\n</b>           Managing the F\u00fchrer's security must\n           be quite an undertaking.\n\n<b>                         BRANDT\n</b>                   (in between mouthfuls)\n           Irregularity is the F\u00fchrer's                            \n           precaution of choice.\n\n<b>                         TRESCKOW\n</b>           I can assure you he's safe here.\n           Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.\n\n    Brandt's look says, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He cleans\n    his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,\n    takes out his datebook and starts writing - once\n    again the precise man we saw on the airfield.\n\n<b>                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n</b>           I understand you're returning to\n           Berlin this afternoon...\n\n    Brandt nods.\n\n<b>                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n</b>           Could I trouble you to deliver a\n           package to Colonel Stieff?\n\n    Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the\n    knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...\n\n\n<b>5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5\n</b>\n    Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over\n    two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:\n\n    TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic           \n    casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.             \n\n    Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through\n    the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a\n    small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his\n    attention to the bottles of Cointreau...\n\n\n<b>6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6\n</b>\n    The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.\n    Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt\n    is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         4.\n</b>\n\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently\n    handles a carefully wrapped package.\n\n    CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of\n    the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The\n    explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.\n\n<b>                         TRESCKOW\n</b>           With my regards to Colonel Stieff.\n\n    Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He\n    studies the familiar shape.\n\n<b>                          BRANDT\n</b>           Cointreau? You better hope I don't\n           get thirsty on the flight.\n\n    Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having\n    just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.\n    Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with\n    Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him\n    along with, we hope, the F\u00fchrer's fate.\n\n    Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:                   \n\n\n<b>7   INT.

The ashtray is overflowing but\n    Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...\n\n    The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He\n    doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.\n\n<b>                        TRESCKOW\n</b>           He's... landed.                                            \n\n    It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.\n\n<b>                           AIDE\n</b>           What about the...\n\n    Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          5.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                          TRESCKOW\n</b>            Get me Colonel Brandt...\n                        (staying cool)\n            Colonel?

It is a long, suspenseful walk.\n     He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting\n     closer.

Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her\n     belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina\n     smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted,\n     but his delight is tainted with worry.\n\n     Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as\n     if divining his secret. His face never changes - a\n     statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we\n     see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly\n     what is going on, but she knows it is something. She\n     does her best to keep smiling for the children. After\n     the longest of moments, she nods. \"All right.\" Then\n     she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears.\n\n     It is an important moment.

The door and many\n     windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open.\n     Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure\n     vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only\n     seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier\n     after all. And no military operation goes according\n     to plan. Making matters worse:\n\n<b>                      FREYEND (CONT'D)\n</b>            Sir, your briefcase.

One by one,\n      they present their individual briefings to the\n      nodding F\u00fchrer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.\n\n<b>                         STAUFFENBERG\n</b>             My injuries left me a bit hard of\n             hearing.

He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the\n      conference hut's young telephone operator.\n\n<b>                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n</b>             Sergeant.

Stifling heat.             \n      We notice again that the windows are open to let in\n      some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long,\n      heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern\n      Europe and the Soviet Union.\n\n      LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and\n      out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in\n      the middle of his briefing:\n\n<b>                           GENERAL\n</b>             The Eastern Front forces are\n             assured a victory... but they need\n             reinforcements.\n\n      In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't\n      say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by\n      Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:\n\n<b>                            KEITEL\n</b>             Please pardon our tardiness...

Stauffenberg has come to kill this man\ngreeting him. The moment is broken when the General\nclears his throat, continuing his presentation.\n\n<b>                     GENERAL\n</b>       As you can see, Mein F\u00fchrer, the\n       situation in the East Prussian\n       sector is increasingly critical...\n                 (and on and on...)\n\nFreyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes\nhim by the arm, moving him to his place at the table -\nless than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in\nbetween two other officers. We suck in wind when we\nsee who one of them is...\n\nCOLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried\nthe bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long\nago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.\n\nFreyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -\nbumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the\nbriefcase - long enough to make us nervous.\n\nHe watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,\nsliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,\nleaning it against the heavy wooden table support\nimmediately to the right of Hitler's foot.                 \n\nStauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at\nhis watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the\ntelephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?\n\nAround him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear\nnothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat\nin his own ears - the only thing betraying his\notherwise outward calm.\n\nHe looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under\nhis feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we\nstay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.\n\nStauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm.\nThe annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear.\nKeitel sees this, irritated by the interruption.\nStauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand,\nindicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          78.\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>101   INT.

When they are gone, Stauffenberg\n      simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.\n\n      A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the\n      receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway\n      he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.\n\n      Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still\n      hanging outside the briefing room.\n\n<b>                        ADAM (CONT'D)\n</b>             Colonel...

His foot hits something. He looks at:\n\n      Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.\n\n      Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the\n      briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He\n      considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is\n      going to open it.\n\n      But then he puts it back under the table.
