First, so that you can\n            hear my voice and know that I am\n            unhurt. And second, so that you may\n            know the details of a crime without\n            parallel in German history...\n\n\n2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2\n\n    TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT.\n    13 MARCH 1943.\n\n    A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand\n    rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform\n    denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.\n\n    TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF\n    STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.\n\n    Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only\n    movement in the frame.\n\n    PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by\n    Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS\n    escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party\n    dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.\n    Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of\n    distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.\n\n    Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200\n    Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109\n    fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar\n    that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the\n    massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters\n    roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors\n    come to rest and, needing no introduction:\n\n    ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by\n    the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.\n\n    (Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire\n    sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)\n\n                                                         2.\n\n\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,\n    but they are pushed back by SS guards. The F\u00fchrer\n    marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or\n    their waiting limo.\n\n    To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto\n    the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the\n    windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.\n    Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.\n\n                       VOICE (O.S.)\n           It's not so much your car he\n           doesn't trust... It's your driver.\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:\n\n    TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER\n    OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.\n\n    The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in           \n    a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops               \n    into the limo they brought for Hitler.                          \n\n    Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A\n    beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.\n\n\n3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3\n\n    Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is\n    bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.\n\n\n4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4\n\n    Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their\n    necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head\n    table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards.\n    ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.\n\n    HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the\n    F\u00fchrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.\n    We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he\n    places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,\n    deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.\n    When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of\n    the room relaxes slightly and digs in.\n\n    ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow\n    and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,\n    eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.              \n    Tresckow stares.                                                \n\n                                                        3.\n\n\n\n                         TRESCKOW\n           Managing the F\u00fchrer's security must\n           be quite an undertaking.\n\n                         BRANDT\n                   (in between mouthfuls)\n           Irregularity is the F\u00fchrer's                            \n           precaution of choice.\n\n                         TRESCKOW\n           I can assure you he's safe here.\n           Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.\n\n    Brandt's look says, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He cleans\n    his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,\n    takes out his datebook and starts writing - once\n    again the precise man we saw on the airfield.\n\n                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n           I understand you're returning to\n           Berlin this afternoon...\n\n    Brandt nods.\n\n                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n           Could I trouble you to deliver a\n           package to Colonel Stieff?\n\n    Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the\n    knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...\n\n\n5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5\n\n    Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over\n    two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:\n\n    TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic           \n    casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.             \n\n    Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through\n    the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a\n    small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his\n    attention to the bottles of Cointreau...\n\n\n6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6\n\n    The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.\n    Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt\n    is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.\n\n                                                         4.\n\n\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently\n    handles a carefully wrapped package.\n\n    CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of\n    the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The\n    explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.\n\n                         TRESCKOW\n           With my regards to Colonel Stieff.\n\n    Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He\n    studies the familiar shape.\n\n                          BRANDT\n           Cointreau? You better hope I don't\n           get thirsty on the flight.\n\n    Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having\n    just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.\n    Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with\n    Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him\n    along with, we hope, the F\u00fchrer's fate.\n\n    Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:                   \n\n\n7   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             7\n\n    A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.\n\n    Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a\n    desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n8   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             8\n\n    Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but\n    Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...\n\n    The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He\n    doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.\n\n                        TRESCKOW\n           He's... landed.                                            \n\n    It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.\n\n                           AIDE\n           What about the...\n\n    Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.\n\n                                                          5.\n\n\n\n                          TRESCKOW\n            Get me Colonel Brandt...\n                        (staying cool)\n            Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you\n            landed safely... I hate to trouble\n            you but there's been a bit of a mix\n            up. It seems you have the wrong\n            bottles for Colonel Stieff. You...\n            do still have the package?\n\n     Long pause. Torture. Then:\n\n                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n            I can be at your office first thing\n            tomorrow morning to pick it up.\n            Terribly sorry for the\n            inconvenience... Thank you.\n\n     Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone.\n\n                            AIDE\n            Do you think he knows?\n\n     Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and\n     pouring two glasses with a shaking hand.\n\n                          TRESCKOW\n            There's only one way to be sure...\n\n\n9    EXT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - DAY                               9\n\n     Est. An early morning fog blankets the ground,\n     obscuring our view. Eerie.\n\n\n10   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY                     10\n\n     Footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways.\n     Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous\n     security checkpoints. It is a long, suspenseful walk.\n     He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting\n     closer. We think he's done for, but a BESPECTACLED,\n     MIDDLE-AGED OFFICER overtakes him and whispers:\n\n                             OFFICER                                  \n            What happened?                                            \n\n     TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH OLBRICHT - CHIEF OF GENERAL            \n     ARMY OFFICE IN BERLIN.                                           \n\n                                                     6.\n\n\n\n                     TRESCKOW                               \n       I can only guess the altitude                        \n       caused the fuse to malfunction.                      \n       First the beer hall, Memorial Day -                  \n       now this.

The Gestapo\n       came for him last night.\n\nTresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking.\nOlbricht hurries after him.\n\n                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)\n       Did you hear what I said?\n\n                     TRESCKOW\n       The Gestapo could have arrested him\n       for anything. Find a replacement.                    \n\n                    OLBRICHT\n       There's no one we can trust. Not in                  \n       Berlin.                                              \n\n                     TRESCKOW\n       Then stop looking in Berlin.                         \n\nJust then, they approach the final threshold, a             \nSENTRY guards an office marked:\n\nCOLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.\n\nOlbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But          \nTresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to\nenter when:\n\n                      SENTRY\n       Your pistol please.\n\nOh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol\nfrom its holster and handing it over.                       \n\nAnd with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his\nshoulders and enters Brandt's office.\n\n                                                        7.\n\n\n\n\n11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11\n\n     Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow\n     notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A\n     clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally:            \n\n     Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the          \n     gesture is almost casual. Pure formality.                      \n\n                           BRANDT                                   \n            You'll forgive me, General.

We can't decide why. He picks\n     up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool\n     despite the armed explosive just a few feet away.\n\n                           BRANDT\n            I took you for another sort,\n            General.                                                  \n\n     And we realize he really did just want a drink.

The sound of an EXPLOSION O.S. takes us to:                \n\n\n12   EXT.

A column of tanks, trucks\n     and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely\n     contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around\n     others dumping documents into burning oil drums.\n\n     In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young\n     officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform\n     complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than\n     the other side of your pillow. He directs men this\n     way and that, holding back panic.                                \n\n     TITLES: COLONEL CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG - STAFF\n     OFFICER, 10TH PANZER DIVISION.\n\n                                                     9.\n\n\n\nA jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by\na YOUNG LIEUTENANT.\n\n                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT\n       Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new\n       headquarters has been established\n       at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.\n\nStauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       Now they tell us to disengage - a\n       day late. No matter how many times\n       we tell Command the reality, they\n       always manage to leave us-\n\nBut he stops himself, containing his rage.\n\n                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT\n       Colonel, the enemy is less than\n       five kilometers from here. You've\n       done all you can.\n\nStauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating\na ring on his finger. After a beat:\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       I wonder... Was there even a point\n       in our coming to Tunis?\n\n                YOUNG LIEUTENANT\n       To get taken prisoner, it seems.\n\nStauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:\n\nBOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the\ntight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.\nFighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery\nblasts strike in front and behind the retreating\ncolumn. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.\n\nPanic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg\ntaps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.\n\nSoldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short\nsupply and many are left in the open. So they run.\nDozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The\nsurvivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn\nto make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the\nother direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.\n\nStauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.\n\n                                                        10.\n\n\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.\n\n     The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him.\n     They turn and watch the formation of planes complete\n     their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense,\n     some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            STAND FAST, I SAID.\n\n     They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines\n     growing louder, meaner...\n\n\n13   INT.

Unable to change course quickly\n     enough, they spray their lead into the sand.\n\n     In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his\n     seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and\n     a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet.\n     Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the\n     turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns\n     to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But\n     Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's\n     head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER\n     coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of\n     frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.\n\n     BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield\n     before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear\n     blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.\n\n     SILENCE. FADE TO WHITE.\n\n\n15   INT.

Heels on linoleum. A beautiful,\n     dignified woman keeps herself from running. She is:\n\n     NINA VON STAUFFENBERG (30), Stauffenberg's wife and\n     mother of his four children. Beside her is BERTHOLD\n     VON STAUFFENBERG (38), Stauffenberg's older brother.\n\n     They reach the door of a private hospital room just\n     as A DOCTOR comes out. Awkward pause.\n\n                           DOCTOR\n            Mrs. Stauffenberg?\n\n                            NINA\n               (nodding, gesturing to Berthold)\n            The Colonel's brother, Berthold.\n\n                           DOCTOR\n            Perhaps before you see the Colonel\n            we should go to my office and-\n\n                            NINA\n            I will see my husband now.\n\n     The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him\n     down. He opens the door and they enter to find:\n\n\n16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16\n\n     A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small\n     openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and\n     hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement\n     but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest.\n\n     Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina\n     bravely turns to the Doctor. \"Well?\"\n\n                          DOCTOR\n            He's been constant with fever but\n            he refuses any pain killers. The\n            right hand has been amputated above\n            the wrist. He's lost the fourth and\n            fifth fingers on the left. We...\n            couldn't save the left eye.\n\n     Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock.\n\n                             NINA\n            His ring.\n\n                            DOCTOR\n            I don't-\n\n                                                        12.\n\n\n\n                            NINA\n            He had a ring on his right hand.\n            Where is it?\n\n                           DOCTOR\n            I'm sorry... His hand was amputated\n            in the field... I'm afraid-\n\n                             NINA\n            Thank you.                                               \n\n     As in: \"That will be all.\" The Doctor leaves. Nina              \n     sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of\n     FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl.\n\n     Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins\n     to tear.\n\n     Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a\n     chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It\n     is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa.\n\n     CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis-\n     initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and\n     chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She\n     cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and\n     turns away, not wanting her husband to see.\n\n     Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to\n     speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where\n     Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question,\n     even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then:\n\n                          BERTHOLD\n            We've lost North Africa.\n\n     CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes.\n\n\n17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17\n\n     Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch\n     covering what had been his left eye. The chain with\n     the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck.\n\n     ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed.\n\n     A man's belongings tell you more about him than he\n     ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly\n     arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well\n     worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print\n     meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After\n     that a new, child-like hand has taken over.\n\n                                                   13.\n\n\n\nA family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of\nanother generation - wealthy aristocrats from a\nbygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and\nsmiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.\n\nStauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under\nhis eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to\nbutton his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he\ntries to do the buttons with the use of only three\nfingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to\nwatch.\n\nHe is about to give up when he notices a figure\nlooming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces\nat the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       I don't know what I ever did with\n       ten.\n\nOlbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but\nStauffenberg beats him to it.\n\n              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n       I'm wanted in Berlin.\n\nOlbricht nods.\n\n              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n       Are you asking as a member of the\n       High Command?\n\nOlbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes\nthe door behind him, nervously glancing at the\npatient in the next bed.\n\n              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n       You can speak openly, General. He\n       died just before you came in.\n\nAwkward moment. Finally:\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       We could use your help.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       I'm a field officer.\n\nOlbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       This war can't be won in the field.\n\n                                                 14.\n\n\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       That's unfortunate for me.                         \n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       You can't honestly believe you'll\n       make a difference on the front-\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       I'm a soldier, General. I serve my\n       country.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       It makes no sense. You opposed\n       Hitler, you opposed the war.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       The people chose otherwise and here\n       we are. Now we have to win. You\n       know what will happen if we don't.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       If we win, it will still be\n       Hitler's Germany.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       We all took an oath, General.                      \n\nOlbricht nods, resigning. He realizes it is no use.\nFinally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to\nreveal a brilliant gold medal.\n\n                    OLBRICHT\n       On behalf of the F\u00fchrer.\n\nStauffenberg takes the medal and studies it.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       I'm a twin, you know.\n\nOlbricht is as confused as we are.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       I... I didn't.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       My brother died the day after we\n       were born.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       I'm sorry.\n\nWhat the hell is he talking about?\n\n                                                         15.\n\n\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            I was lying in the desert, covered\n            in blood, sure I was going to die.\n            I tried to think about my wife, my\n            children... But my mind kept\n            drifting to my dead brother. How I\n            would finally be with him. How I\n            would finally be whole again...\n\n     He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            This is my reward for what happened\n            to my men. It's all I deserve.\n\n     Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a\n     nearby bedpan.\n\n\n18   INT.

A three fingered hand             \n     enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to         \n     the one just saw.                                             \n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his             \n     finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an                \n     unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER.                                  \n\n     AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray             \n     stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals.               \n\n     PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands              \n     between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED            \n     SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so         \n     with reverence. The ward is eerily silent.                    \n\n     With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the          \n     medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying         \n     them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each         \n     medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch.          \n\n     Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself               \n     looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in               \n     Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs         \n     gone, his face smashed.                                       \n\n     CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa         \n     taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a               \n     familiar clicking of heels and:                               \n\n                                                      16.\n\n\n\n\n19   INT.

At first he does not hear:\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n            Colonel... COLONEL.\n\n     A hand grabs his shoulder. Stauffenberg turns, ready\n     to strike. He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a\n     small, square box. Another sort medal perhaps?                 \n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            I don't want the damn th-                               \n\n     The Doctor opens the box to reveal:                            \n\n     A GLASS EYEBALL sitting atop a layer of satin,\n     staring blankly back at Stauffenberg. Creepy.\n\n                          DOCTOR\n            When will you be going back to the\n            front?\n\n     Beat. Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            I'm not going to the front. I'm\n            needed in Berlin.\n\n\n20   EXT.

A YOUNG OFFICER enters the\n     frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and\n     opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the\n     stoop.                                                         \n\n     The figure steps into the half light to reveal his\n     fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of          \n     the foyer we CUT TO:\n\n                                                       17.\n\n\n\n\n22   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 22\n\n     Chaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh\n     words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians -\n     are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once.\n     Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the\n     YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again.\n\n     Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We\n     recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find...\n\n     A distinguished gentleman in his early sixties:\n\n     TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF\n     THE MILITARY DISTRICT. FORCED OUT BY HITLER, 1938.\n\n     Beside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite\n     his 59 years. A face millions might follow. He is:\n\n     TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG.\n     RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937.\n\n     And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly\n     kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and\n     saddened by it.                                                \n\n     TITLES: LUDWIG BECK - FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE\n     GERMAN ARMY. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1938.\n\n                         WITZLEBEN\n            ...He is not a man, he's a lunatic.\n            He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck.\n            He has no weakness to exploit, no\n            vice to manipulate. His only                            \n            passion is complete control. How\n            can you expect to reason with him?\n\n                         GOERDELER\n            After this most recent failure I'd\n            say we've no other choice.\n\n                         WITZLEBEN\n            Confront Hitler now and you'll end\n            up with piano wire for a neck-tie.\n            Our only option is the central\n            solution.                                               \n\n                         GOERDELER\n            He's a man like any other. Flesh\n            and blood. Take him head on and-\n\n                                                   18.\n\n\n\n                    TRESCKOW\n       I'll say this for you, Doctor...\n       You're certainly delusional enough\n       to take Hitler's place.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n                  (eyes narrowing)\n       When that day comes, I'll be sure\n       to remember you.\n\n                     TRESCKOW\n       I doubt you'll remember much of\n       anything.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n       Dammit, Tresckow-\n\nAnd the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees\nStauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn,\nnudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room\nis silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a\nlittle embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat:\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       Gentlemen, may I present Colonel\n       Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned\n       to my office at the War Ministry.\n                  (to Stauffenberg)\n       Colonel, may I introduce-\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       These men need no introduction.\n\nBeck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand.                  \n\n                       BECK\n       I apologize for this unfortunate...\n       spectacle. On behalf of everyone,\n       welc-\n\nBut before he can finish, Beck is seized with a\ngravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill\nthrough the room. He is very ill.                          \n\n                     GOERDELER\n                   (to the others)\n       I haven't welcomed him. Not yet.\n       Where does he stand?\n\n                     TRESCKOW\n       For God's sake-\n\n                                                 19.\n\n\n\n                    GOERDELER\n                 (re: Stauffenberg)\n       He's a field officer. He knows the\n       army better than any of us. I want\n       to hear his opinion.\n\n                     TRESCKOW                            \n                  (to Stauffenberg)\n       All right. What do you think,                     \n       Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him               \n       to resign? Or the central solution?               \n\nBut before Stauffenberg can answer:                      \n\n                    GOERDELER                            \n       \"Central Solution.\" You soldiers                  \n       are all the same. Say what you                    \n       mean.                                             \n\n                    WITZLEBEN                            \n       That's a laugh coming from a                      \n       politician.                                       \n\n                    GOERDELER                            \n       The army will follow diplomats                    \n       before they follow assassins.\n\n                     TRESCKOW                            \n       They follow a butcher now. What\n       difference does it-                               \n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       What makes you think the army will                \n       follow you at all?                                \n\nThe room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He      \nlikes Stauffenberg already.                              \n\n              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)                      \n       Oust him, kill him. That isn't what               \n       matters. How do you plan to take                  \n       control of the government when                    \n       Hitler is gone?                                   \n\nSilence. Then a wave of laughter. \"The balls on this     \nguy.\"                                                    \n\n                    GOERDELER                            \n       I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you               \n       are in the presence of men who                    \n       would have been Hitler's inner                    \n       circle. Instead we resigned. We put               \n       our principles above personal gain.               \n\n                                                        20.\n\n\n\n                         WITZLEBEN                                   \n            We have the have the respect of the                      \n            people. And the army.                                    \n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            With all respect, sir, you put too\n            much faith in your popularity.\n                    (to Goerdeler, pointed)\n            All of you do.\n\n                         GOERDELER\n            Now see here, Colonel-\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            You said yourself, I'm a field                           \n            officer. You all may understand                          \n            government, but I know the men. A                        \n            great many of them may hate Hitler,                      \n            but they all fear him - they fear                        \n            Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the                      \n            Reich. That kind of fear won't just                      \n            die with Hitler. And as for                              \n            respect: the army, and the people,                       \n            respect only one thing. Authority.                       \n            And if just one man questions that                       \n            authority, you can lose them all.                        \n                      (to Beck, pointed)                             \n            They were fooled into following                          \n            Hitler... How will you fool them -                       \n            force them - into following you?                         \n\n     Pause. The conspirators look at one another again,\n     unsure of how to answer. For Stauffenberg it is a\n     dreadful revelation.\n\n\n23   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - NIGHT                             23\n\n     A depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted\n     night streets. Silent but for the echo of his\n     footsteps. Eerie.\n\n     Across the street, an OLD WOMAN peers nervously out\n     her window. The instant Stauffenberg makes eye\n     contact she steps back, drawing the curtains. Afraid.\n\n     He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home\n     he shares with his brother, Berthold. He is surprised\n     when he looks through the window to find FOUR\n     CHILDREN laughing and playing - the sound of music on\n     a phonograph. Bittersweet.\n\n                                                         21.\n\n\n\n     In the next house over, he catches sight of a TEENAGE\n     BOY, the picture of Aryan youth, watching him\n     suspiciously from the upstairs window. It seems\n     everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German.\n\n\n24   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - NIGHT                            24\n\n     Stauffenberg comes through the front door, the sound\n     of the phonograph blaring now. Meet the children:\n     BERTHOLD (9), HEIMERAN (7), FRANZ (5), VALERIE (2).\n\n     They chase one another around the house in their\n     pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph\n     skips. (It will do so throughout the scene.) The\n     children see Stauffenberg and charge, screaming:\n\n                           CHILDREN\n            PAPA.\n\n     He scoops them up, one by one, and kisses them,\n     instantly putting the day's events behind him.\n     Berthold follows them into the room, smiling.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                         (to children)\n            What are you doing here? I thought\n            I left you in Bamberg.\n                         (to Berthold)\n            It's a wonderful surprise. Thank\n            you, brother.\n\n                          CHILDREN\n            MAMA, COME DOWN. PAPA IS HERE. PAPA\n            IS HERE. (Etc.)\n\n\n25   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                  25\n\n     Nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror. LOOK\n     DOWN TO REVEAL a small datebook with a smaller\n     monthly calendar in the corner of the page. A red dot\n     marks one date in particular, followed by black dots\n     for each day that has passed since. She turns\n     sideways, smoothing her dress over her belly. In\n     every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant.\n\n     She tucks the datebook under some sundries in her\n     luggage and rushes down to greet her husband.\n\n     We stay in the room, hearing her greet Stauffenberg\n     O.S. Laughter at children's antics we cannot see. The\n     phonograph skips. More laughter.\n\n                                                        22.\n\n\n     We want to go see them in their happiness. Instead we\n     linger on Stauffenberg's dresser - neat and orderly.\n     We focus on a photograph of the family from happier\n     times.\n\n     Beside it is a small box containing a glass eye.                \n\n\n26   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT             26\n\n     Stauffenberg and Nina dance with one another to the\n     delight of the children. We gradually PUSH IN tight\n     on their faces, watching an entire conversation take\n     place without dialogue. Each has a secret the other\n     can guess. Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her\n     belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina\n     smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted,\n     but his delight is tainted with worry.\n\n     Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as\n     if divining his secret. His face never changes - a\n     statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we\n     see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly\n     what is going on, but she knows it is something. She\n     does her best to keep smiling for the children. After\n     the longest of moments, she nods. \"All right.\" Then\n     she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears.\n\n     It is an important moment. Read it again, taking the\n     time to picture it in your mind. Then leave it alone.\n     Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his\n     family and the fate of the world.\n\n\n27   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT             27\n\n     Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining\n     room - an idyllic scene. The sound of the phonograph\n     is soft and constant.\n\n     Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the\n     use of only three fingers. Berthold sits across from\n     him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have\n     just missed. They speak in hushed tones.\n\n                          BERTHOLD\n            What do you mean you quit?\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            I came to join the Resistance, not\n            some sewing circle of discarded\n            generals and politicians.\n\n                                                 23.\n\n\n\n                     BERTHOLD\n       Beck is a just and capable man. As\n       for Goerdeler, well, he's popular.\n       He'll make a good Chancellor.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately\n       I have to wonder if Germany is even\n       fit to choose her own destiny.\n\n                    BERTHOLD\n       You can't blame the people for\n       this. You have to see the beginning\n       of something to know how it'll end.\n       It's no different than a farmer\n       watching the corn grow. One day\n       it's over his head.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       Plenty of people thought-\n\n                     BERTHOLD\n       The greatest offenders are not the\n       ones who thought better but the\n       ones who sensed better.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       What are you trying to say?\n\n                    BERTHOLD\n       I seem to remember you telling me\n       about reports from the Ukraine -\n       the SS forcing Jews to dig their\n       own graves. You said then that\n       Hitler should be removed. An\n       officer's duty, you said. What's\n       changed?\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       I said senior officers. The only\n       men that can get to him.                           \n\n                    BERTHOLD\n       Perhaps it doesn't matter that you\n       succeed.\n\nStauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but:\n\n                BERTHOLD (CONT'D)\n       Perhaps it only matters that you\n       try. Don't you see? Someone has to\n       stand up and show the world that\n       not all of us were like him.\n\n                                                       24.\n\n\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            Even if they could remove Hitler,\n            they can't hope to seize power. For\n            God's sake, they have no plan.\n\n                          BERTHOLD\n            Then give them one. Find a way.\n\n     He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm.\n\n                     BERTHOLD (CONT'D)\n            Evil happens when good men do\n            nothing.\n\n     Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes\n     blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable\n     sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            Children, that is far too-\n\n     He is cut off by the appearance of his four children,\n     all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for\n     helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge\n     into the room, singing loudly and attacking their\n     father. He does his best to defend himself with one\n     hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip.\n\n     And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull\n     back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to\n     notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is\n     not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then\n     Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children\n     freeze and the phonograph skips without their help.\n     The glasses on the table rattle.\n\n     Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            Air-raid.\n\n     The adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled\n     concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently,\n     turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter.\n\n\n28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28\n\n     The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a\n     corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs\n     are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the\n     explosions fray the nerves.\n\n                                                       25.\n\n\n     Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness,\n     finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his -\n     around their unborn child.\n\n     BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris\n     fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the\n     phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning.\n\n     CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as\n     the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of\n     profound realization...\n\n\n29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29\n\n     Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down\n     at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera\n     begins to turn until all the world around us is\n     spinning and only the record is still. We read one\n     word of the title of the 78 quite clearly:\n\n                    STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)                             \n            Valkyrie.\n\n\n30   INT.

What is Valkyrie?\n\n                          TRESCKOW\n            Operation Valkyrie.\n\n     Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg,\n     curious. What does he have in mind?\n\n                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)\n            The Reserve Army has thousands of                       \n            men all over the city - most of                         \n            them not even in uniform. Valkyrie                      \n            is top secret plan to mobilize                          \n            those men in a national emergency.                      \n\n                                              26.\n\n\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG                       \n       Hitler designed it himself to crush\n       any internal unrest if he's cut off\n       or killed.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n       And what use is that to us?\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       The orders could be rewritten.

Someone is getting reamed.\n     Fromm's adjutant, LIEUTENANT FRANZ HERBER - a young,\n     dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to\n     ignore the screaming from the other room in between\n     stolen glances at...\n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg and Olbricht\n     waiting patiently, sitting across from:\n\n     MAJOR JOHN VON FREYEND, a dutiful Nazi whose face we\n     immediately don't like. He smiles coldly, taking\n     pleasure in the shouting O.S.

Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident\n     look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without\n     looking up to see them:\n\n                           FROMM\n            What is it you want?\n\n     Olbricht hesitates.

Speak up.\n\n                          OLBRICHT\n            I wanted to introduce you to our\n            new man - Colonel Stauffenberg.\n\n                           FROMM\n            Ah yes - the hero from Africa.

The game of recruitment is about to begin and\nno one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet,\nthe more awkward things seem. Finally:\n\n                  FROMM (CONT'D)\n       They tell me you're critical of the\n       war, Colonel.

This was a bit too obvious.\nStauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. \"What the hell\nare you doing?\"\n\nFromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the\nashtray and picks up the telephone.\n\nOlbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves -\ncertain they are going to be reported.

In the center is a tree stump\n     surrounded by papers, including the original orders\n     for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise\n     marked with the seal of the Reich.

Pause.\n     Then she starts typing with remarkable speed.\n\n     (Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene,\n     punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each\n     time a little louder.)\n\n     Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the\n     Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes.\n\n                          TRESCKOW\n            Looking this over, I'm not\n            satisfied that the Reserve Army is\n            enough to shut down Berlin\n            completely.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                     (handing over papers)\n            Yes, I've been giving that some\n            thought.

Stauffenberg,            \n     Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit            \n     bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the            \n     middle.                                                       \n\n     Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the                \n     Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter              \n     case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking          \n     around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone              \n     could be watching from the shadows.

The Waiter serves carefully,\n     making sure one particular drink goes to:\n\n     TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY\n     SIGNAL CORPS.\n\n     The group toasts and downs their booze.\n\n     CLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks\n     into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely\n     excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and\n     heads for the bathroom.

Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the\n     sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            None of my associates know we've\n            been talking if that's what you're\n            afraid of.\n\n                         FELLGIEBEL\n            But you know. And when the SS catch\n            you, they'll pull you apart like\n            warm bread. It'll be a crime just\n            to have known you then.

Only God can judge you\n            now.\n\n     BANG. The door bursts open, startling them both. But\n     it is only a DRUNKEN OFFICER and a YOUNG WOMAN\n     looking for some privacy.\n\n                      DRUNKEN OFFICER\n            Are you two finished or just\n            getting started?\n\n     The woman laughs.

He has\n     arrived at a meeting of great importance.\n\n     He turns to face Haeften directly and we are\n     surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant\n     the young lion he once was. But a closer look is\n     unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye\n     glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead.\n\n     His glass eye.

In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy\n     officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches\n     Stauffenberg pass, aloof.

Drunken laughter.\n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: THE BIG SIX.\n\n     Hitler and five men - some of them almost\n     caricatures, their features so distinct. The first\n     man we recognize as Keitel - the general who reamed\n     Fromm. The others we know from history and TITLES:\n\n     MINISTER ALBERT SPEER - ARCHITECT FOR THE NEW REICH.\n\n     DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS - REICH MINISTER OF PUBLIC\n     ENLIGHTENMENT AND PROPAGANDA.\n\n     REICHSF\u00dcHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER - HEAD OF THE SS AND\n     GESTAPO.\n\n     REICH MARSHAL HERMANN GOERING - HEAD OF THE GERMAN\n     ARMED FORCES, HITLER'S SECOND IN COMMAND.\n\n                                                    45.\n\n\n\nWe have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi\nGermany on the day after the Normandy invasion. But\nyou would never know the tide of the war had just\nturned against Germany. A series of situation maps\nare scattered before them, ignored.\n\nOnly Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but\nclearly tuned into the present reality. Looking\ncloser at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up -\nadding to the already surreal nature of the scene.\n\nIt is also the first time we are allowed a clear,\nunobstructed view of Hitler.\n\n                      FROMM\n       Mein F\u00fchrer... I wish to present\n       Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg -\n       our new Chief of General Staff for\n       the Replacement Army.\n\nThe laughter stops. Hitler and his cronies turn\ntoward Stauffenberg, looking him over. Hitler stands\nand crosses to him. Fromm meets him first, whispering\nin the F\u00fchrer's ear - perhaps reminding him who\nStauffenberg is. Hitler nods: \"Ah yes.\" He takes\nStauffenberg's left hand with both of his. We are\nsurprised by his charm.\n\n                     HITLER\n       May I say, I am honored to meet a\n       hero who has sacrificed so much for\n       Germany. If only more of my\n       officers were like you.\n\nHitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to\nthemselves. To make it worse, Hitler turns to them.\n\n                 HITLER (CONT'D)\n       Let this man stand as an example to\n       all of you. He is the ideal German\n       officer.\n\nFromm nervously clears his throat.\n\n                      FROMM\n       Mein F\u00fchrer, we have asked\n       Stauffenberg here today so that he\n       might brief us on mobilizing troops\n       from the Home Army to support those\n       in Normandy.\n\n                                                      46.\n\n\n\n                           HITLER\n            Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will\n            no longer be necessary. General\n            Goering has assured me that\n            Normandy is under control.\n\n     Stauffenberg's good eye flickers. \"Are you insane?\n     Normandy is a catastrophe.\" Another glance at the\n     situation map shows Allied forces over-running.\n\n     But the painted-on smiles of Hitler's nodding cronies\n     promote the lie. No one has the courage to tell\n     Hitler anything close to the truth. Somewhere in\n     their eyes is the fear that someone will.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Mein F\u00fchrer, if I may... The\n            situation in Normandy is-\n\n                           KEITEL\n            You're dismissed, Stauffenberg.\n\n                         STAUFFENBERG\n            But-\n\n                           KEITEL\n            Send your man home, Fromm. Then\n            bring us some brandy.\n\n     Fromm is stung - a man of his rank being treated like\n     a waiter. Stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels\n     and salutes, just managing to say:\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Heil Hitler.\n\n     Hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat.\n     Fromm and Stauffenberg leave.\n\n\n46   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                46\n\n     Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his\n     waiting vehicle. Haeften opens the car door for\n     Stauffenberg to get in. Fromm leans in.\n\n                           FROMM\n            I don't know what you've got\n            brewing and I don't want to know...\n            But when the music stops, I'd be\n            much obliged if Keitel should find\n            himself without a chair.\n\n                                                      47.\n\n\n\n     Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a\n     condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before\n     Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut\n     and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.\n\n\n47   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - CONTINUOUS                        47\n\n     Stauffenberg leans back in his seat, mentally\n     calculating his next step.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            They're all insane. Every one of\n            them except for Speer, and he's\n            nothing but an architect.\n\n     Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his\n     glass eye. He polishes it with a cloth and now it\n     stares at him from his gloved hand. A conscience.\n\n                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            Tell Beck we've found our\n            assassin...\n                 (off Haeften's confused look)\n            I'll do it myself.\n\n\n48   INT. CHURCH - NIGHT                                     48\n\n     We find ourselves in an empty church. Beck is seated\n     in a pew staring straight ahead. Stauffenberg sits\n     directly behind him. They can't risk being seen\n     together. They speak in hushed tones.\n\n     The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck\n     looks. He struggles to hide a persistent cough.\n\n                            BECK\n            Out of the question. It won't work.\n            We need you here in Berlin.\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            Who else, then? Who can even get as\n            close?\n\n     Beck knows there is no other choice.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n            Valkyrie is very clear. Once the\n            order is given, the Reserve Army                        \n            will automatically seize control of\n            the government with or without me.                      \n\n                                                         48.\n\n\n\n                            BECK                                      \n            Orders are not enough. They need a                        \n            man to follow. The right man.                             \n\n     Pause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking                \n     pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh:              \n\n                       STAUFFENBERG                                   \n            Olbricht will oversee operations in                       \n            my absence.

We stay on her as he joins the\n     children. She watches them play together, seeing her\n     husband laughing for the first time in a long while.\n     Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and\n     anguish.

A drone.                           \n\n     After an awkward pause:                                        \n\n                         STAUFFENBERG                               \n                         (to the Driver)                            \n            Drive on.                                               \n\n\n     EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - VARIOUS - DAY                               \n\n     CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG'S BAG. A series of JUMP CUTS\n     follow the bag through the extensive security layers\n     one must endure before getting to the meeting. ID is\n     checked frequently. The bags, not once. The men here\n     are Hitler's inner circle, after all.\n\n\n59   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMPOUND - DAY                       59\n\n     Finally, Stauffenberg and Haeften are escorted toward\n     the bunker where the meeting will be held. Pausing,\n     Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find:\n\n     THE COMMUNICATIONS HUT - through the open door of the\n     small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs. A\n     LONE FIGURE stands outside, smoking a cigarette.\n\n                           HAEFTEN\n                    (whispering to Haeften)                         \n            Your man?\n\n     Yes. And it is none other than GENERAL ERICH\n     FELLGIEBEL, the man Stauffenberg confronted in the\n     bathroom at the Officers' Club so long ago.\n\n     He and Stauffenberg share a long, intense stare.\n     Finally, Fellgiebel nods, dropping his cigarette and\n     crushing it with his boot. He's in.\n\n     Stauffenberg and Haeften head inside the impervious\n     bunker through the heavy steel door.\n\n                                                         57.\n\n\n\n\n60   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           60\n\n     Stauffenberg and Haeften find themselves in a\n     cramped, hot, windowless room filled with VARIOUS\n     OFFICERS waiting around a large conference table.\n\n     Silence. A moment later, Hitler enters - Keitel and\n     Fromm follow close behind. Heels click in unison.\n     Keitel starts the meeting, but Stauffenberg isn't\n     listening. While all eyes follow Hitler, Stauffenberg\n     watches the door, scanning the faces in the room.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                         (whispering)\n            Himmler. Where is Himmler?\n\n     Haeften doesn't see him either. Shit.\n\n                          KEITEL\n            ...Now for the first order of\n            business. Fromm, I believe you will\n            brief us on blocking divisions for\n            the Eastern Front...\n\n     Stauffenberg silently excuses himself from the room.\n     We hold on his briefcase. Remember where he left it.\n\n\n61   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               61\n\n     The phone rings. A waiting Mertz grabs it.\n\n                            MERTZ\n            General Olbricht's Office.\n                      (suddenly nervous)\n            Hold the line.\n                         (to Olbricht)\n            Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at\n            the briefing. He wants to proceed.                        \n\n     All color drains from Olbricht's face.\n\n                           OLBRICHT\n            Call Beck.\n\n     He leaves. Mertz rolls his eyes and dials a second\n     phone.\n\n                                                         58.\n\n\n\n\n62   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     62\n\n     Beck and Goerdeler sit impatiently by the telephone,\n     waiting for any word on the assassination and\n     impending coup. When the telephone RINGS:\n\n                             BECK\n            Beck.\n\n     He presses the receiver tightly to his ear, a look of\n     concern washing over his face. He turns to Goerdeler.\n\n                       BECK (CONT'D)\n            Himmler is not in the briefing.\n\n     Goerdeler's reaction is vintage politician. Blank.\n\n\n63   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - HALLWAY - DAY                 63\n\n     CLOSE ON A CIGARETTE. We watch as Stauffenberg\n     smokes, waits, looks at his watch - the sounds of the\n     meeting going on behind him. He drops his cigarette\n     and we see a pile of three more. He has been waiting\n     while the others deliberate. Finally:\n\n                      MERTZ (ON PHONE)\n            They say no. Wait.\n\n     (Note: Intercut between Mertz and Stauffenberg.)\n\n     Stauffenberg is furious. He calms himself.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            What do you say?\n\n     Pause. Mertz looks around, makes sure he is alone.\n\n                             MERTZ\n            I say do it.\n\n     Stauffenberg hangs up the phone. The moment of truth.\n\n\n64   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           64\n\n     Stauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing\n     unnoticed. He freezes:\n\n     CLOSE ON: The spot where Stauffenberg left his\n     briefcase. Remember? Well it's gone.\n\n                                                         59.\n\n\n\n     He looks around frantically. Some officers notice\n     him. Tension mounts. He gets Haeften's attention.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                          (mouthing)\n            My briefcase.\n\n     Before Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a\n     glare. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\n                           KEITEL\n            ...Gentleman. You are dismissed.\n\n     And like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg\n     is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits,\n     walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out.\n     The last to leave is Fromm.\n\n                           FROMM\n            That call better have been\n            important.\n\n     Stauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend,\n     Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing\n     briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up.\n\n                          FREYEND\n            Your bag... Colonel.\n\n     He hands it over and leaves.\n\n\n65   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY           65\n\n     A military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard\n     Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car,\n     racing to get General Hase's attention.\n\n     LARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in\n     the hot sun, awaiting orders.\n\n                            HASE\n                         (whispering)\n            What the hell is going on? My men\n            have been standing here for an\n            hour. I don't know what to tell\n            them.\n\n     CLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember)\n     standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht\n     suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying.\n     After a moment, Hase addresses the men.\n\n                                                 60.\n\n\n\n                  HASE (CONT'D)\n       At ease, gentlemen.\n\nOlbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to\nhide his nerves.\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       This has been a drill. You're all\n       to be commended for your quick\n       response. Dismissed.\n\nPause. The men linger, confused until:\n\n                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)\n       HEIL HITLER.\n\n                      SOLDIERS\n       HEIL HITLER.\n\nAnd the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just\nlight up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.\n\n                      HAGEN\n       What did I tell you? A drill.\n\nBut Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at\nOlbricht makes us nervous.\n\nCLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making\nnote of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's     \nuniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.\n\n                    OLBRICHT\n       That man there. Who is he?\n\n                       HASE\n       Major Remer? He commands the\n       Deutschland Guard Battalion. What\n       about him?\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       Get rid of him.\n\n                      HASE\n       Remer? Don't worry about him. He's\n       an order taker. To the bone.\n\nAh yes... But whose orders?\n\n                                                          61.\n\n\n\n\n66   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY           66\n\n     As usual, Lt. Herber sits at his desk and, as usual,\n     he tries to ignore:\n\n     MUTED SHOUTS through Fromm's office door. PULL BACK\n     TO REVEAL Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting.\n\n     They sit across from, Freyend. A beat later, Keitel\n     storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with\n     anger. Deja vu. When Keitel and Freyend are gone:\n\n     Herber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile.\n\n                           HERBER\n            The General will see you now.\n\n     Stauffenberg and Olbricht stand, hats in hand.\n\n\n67   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER         67\n\n                           FROMM\n            How dare you put the Reserve Army\n            on standby without my knowledge.\n            You damn near cost me my\n            commission. What in God's name made\n            you think you even had the\n            authority?\n\n                          OLBRICHT\n            It was only a drill. An exercise.\n\n                           FROMM\n            DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We\n            both know it was no fucking drill.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            General, if I may-\n\n                           FROMM\n            You may not, Colonel. You may not\n            do anything. Because now you've not\n            only shown me you can't deliver,\n            you've painted a target on my back.\n            If I so much as sense you trying to\n            move the Reserve Army again, I'll\n            personally have you both arrested.\n            Do I make myself abundantly clear?\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT\n            Yes, sir.\n\n                                                         62.\n\n\n\n                               FROMM\n            Heil Hitler.\n\n                           OLBRICHT\n            Heil Hitler.\n\n     But Stauffenberg turns to leave without answering.\n\n                           FROMM\n            I'll hear you say it, Colonel.\n\n     Stauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one\n     eye. He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels\n     loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like:\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            HEIL HITLER.\n\n     Still managing to make it sound spiteful. He leaves\n     without being dismissed, slamming the door.\n\n\n68   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                   68\n\n     It has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are\n     all exhausted. Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and\n     Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg.\n\n                         GOERDELER\n            The point of your central solution\n            is to replace Hitler so that we can\n            negotiate a truce with the Allies.\n            The Allies, I suspect, would be\n            more amenable to a truce... IF WE\n            OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN\n            FUCKING BERLIN.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Today was a matter of indecision -\n            nothing more. A military operation\n            in the hands of a politician.\n\n     Stauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler.\n\n                         GOERDELER\n            I don't think I am alone when I say\n            your judgement is in question.\n                        (to the others)\n            I would like to take a vote.\n\n                               BECK\n            Carl.\n\n                                                    63.\n\n\n\n                     GOERDELER\n       I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL\n       STAUFFENBERG.\n\n                       BECK\n       Carl, if I may have a word with you\n       in private.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n       If you have something to say,\n       Ludwig, say it here. Say it now.\n\n                       BECK\n       Very well. There's no need to vote.\n\nBeck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg\nstiffens, ready for the axe.\n\n                  BECK (CONT'D)\n       I consider you a friend. And I look\n       forward to the day when we can once\n       again live as free men. But you've\n       become a liability.\n\nGoerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when\nBeck turns, offering a drink to him.\n\n                  BECK (CONT'D)\n       I'm sorry it has to be this way.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n       Wha... What are you saying?\n\n                       BECK\n       Fellgiebel informed me this\n       evening... Himmler's issued an\n       order for your arrest. You'll have\n       to leave Germany. Tonight. When\n       we've succeeded with the central\n       solution you'll return as\n       Chancellor. Until then-\n\nGoerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg.\n\n                    GOERDELER\n       This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T\n       IT? You can't just get rid of me\n       like this. I am the man Germany\n       will follow. I'm... I...\n\nStauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler\nlooks at the other conspirators, but no one is going\nto speak for him. Finally, almost in tears:\n\n                                                 64.\n\n\n\n                GOERDELER (CONT'D)\n       Ludwig, I-\n\nBeck offers him an envelope.\n\n                      BECK\n       Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with\n       anyone.\n\nUgly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks\nout. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck\ncoughs, turns to Stauffenberg.\n\n                  BECK (CONT'D)\n       No more indecision. From now on,\n       Stauffenberg has discretion.                       \n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       I can't issue Valkyrie again unless\n       we follow through.

For the first time we\n     see his scars and deformities in full. He looks\n     himself over, finally focusing on the chain around\n     his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring -\n     its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning].\n\n     Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues,\n     slowly running the razor down his throat.

The meeting has been\n       pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini\n       is arriving on the afternoon train\n       and Hitler wants to have lunch with\n       him.\n\nStauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus.\n\n                                                         72.\n\n\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Will Mussolini be in the briefing?\n\n                           KEITEL\n            I only wish he were. Then some\n            ambitious officer might take the\n            opportunity to shoot the dago\n            bastard.\n\n     Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others\n     follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back,\n     however, attracting Freyend's attention.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            I'll need a place to wash up -\n            change my shirt.\n\n     Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat\n     and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was\n     intentional after all.\n\n     Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom.\n\n                          FREYEND\n            Please, do be quick. You heard the\n            General.\n\n     Stauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for\n     Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious.\n\n\n92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92\n\n     Fast on Stauffenberg's heels, Haeften closes the\n     door. A large portrait of Hitler looms, watching.\n     Stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with\n     his back to the door. He removes a brick of plastic\n     explosive from his briefcase.\n\n                          HAEFTEN\n                         (whispering)\n            You're arming them... now?                                \n\n     Stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt, taking a\n     clean one out of his bag and putting it on as:\n\n     Haeften assembles a fuse.\n\n                       STAUFFENBERG\n            No room for error this time.

KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY                 93\n\n     CLOSE ON THE TELEPHONE.

KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                94\n\n     Neatly dressed again, Stauffenberg carefully places\n     the primed explosive back in his briefcase. He and\n     Haeften turn their attention to the second explosive -\n     assembling the fuse, about to insert it when:\n\n     BANG. The door swings suddenly open - stopped short\n     by Stauffenberg's backside. He nearly drops the fuse.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Dammit man, what is it?\n\n     It's Freyend, of course, trying to peer through the\n     partially opened door. Stauffenberg hides the bombs\n     with his body.\n\n                          FREYEND\n            General Keitel insists that the\n            Colonel please hurry.\n\n                                                         74.\n\n\n\n     Haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his\n     briefcase. Stauffenberg motions for Haeften to leave.\n\n\n95   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY                      95\n\n     Haeften comes out, moving Freyend back with his body\n     and shutting the door behind him - a charged moment.\n\n                          HAEFTEN\n            The Colonel is changing, Major. You\n            understand this can be difficult.\n\n     Freyend backs down. A little.\n\n\n96   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                96\n\n     Stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers (one handle\n     specially bent for easier use by a man with only\n     three fingers). With some effort, he manages to\n     secure the pliers around the fuse.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE ACID CAPSULE OF THE FUSE. The jaws of\n     the pliers gently squeeze, crushing it. The bomb is\n     live. There is no turning back now.\n\n     Stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door,\n     greeted by Freyend and Haeften.\n\n\n97   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY          97\n\n     Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel.\n     Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                         (to Haeften)\n            See that the car is ready.\n\n     Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the\n     second, unarmed explosive inside.\n\n                           HAEFTEN\n            But sir-\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            I have everything I need,\n            Lieutenant. Thank you.\n\n     Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend\n     turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the\n     pace. He reaches for the briefcase.\n\n                                                         75.\n\n\n\n                          FREYEND\n            Please.

But\n     Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight\n     ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left.\n\n     The bunker suddenly seems miles away.\n\n\n98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98\n\n     Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through\n     the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his\n     pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last.\n\n     Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead -\n     AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n            Where are they going?\n\n                          FREYEND\n            It's too hot. The briefing has been\n            moved to the conference hut.\n\n     ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many\n     windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open.\n     Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure\n     vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only\n     seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier\n     after all. And no military operation goes according\n     to plan. Making matters worse:\n\n                      FREYEND (CONT'D)\n            Sir, your briefcase. I insist.\n\n     Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion,\n     Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He\n     watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause.\n\n     Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to:\n\n     Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building.\n     The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room\n     before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then\n     Stauffenberg steps into the hut.                                 \n\n                                                       76.\n\n\n\n\n99    INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               99\n\n      In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long\n      table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one,\n      they present their individual briefings to the\n      nodding F\u00fchrer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.\n\n                         STAUFFENBERG\n             My injuries left me a bit hard of\n             hearing. See that you place me as\n             near the F\u00fchrer as possible.\n\n      Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere -\n      wrangling everyone into the meeting.\n\n      Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his\n      belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing\n      room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the\n      conference hut's young telephone operator.\n\n                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)\n             Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent\n             call from Berlin...\n\n\n100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100\n\n      A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat.             \n      We notice again that the windows are open to let in\n      some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long,\n      heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern\n      Europe and the Soviet Union.\n\n      LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and\n      out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in\n      the middle of his briefing:\n\n                           GENERAL\n             The Eastern Front forces are\n             assured a victory... but they need\n             reinforcements.\n\n      In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't\n      say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by\n      Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:\n\n                            KEITEL\n             Please pardon our tardiness... You\n             remember Colonel Stauffenberg?\n\n                                                   77.\n\n\n\nHitler makes a deliberate effort to shake\nStauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving\nmoment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man\ngreeting him. The moment is broken when the General\nclears his throat, continuing his presentation.\n\n                     GENERAL\n       As you can see, Mein F\u00fchrer, the\n       situation in the East Prussian\n       sector is increasingly critical...\n                 (and on and on...)\n\nFreyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes\nhim by the arm, moving him to his place at the table -\nless than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in\nbetween two other officers. We suck in wind when we\nsee who one of them is...\n\nCOLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried\nthe bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long\nago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.\n\nFreyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -\nbumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the\nbriefcase - long enough to make us nervous.\n\nHe watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,\nsliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,\nleaning it against the heavy wooden table support\nimmediately to the right of Hitler's foot.                 \n\nStauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at\nhis watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the\ntelephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?\n\nAround him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear\nnothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat\nin his own ears - the only thing betraying his\notherwise outward calm.\n\nHe looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under\nhis feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we\nstay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.\n\nStauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm.\nThe annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear.\nKeitel sees this, irritated by the interruption.\nStauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand,\nindicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.\n\n                                                          78.\n\n\n\n\n101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101\n\n      Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the\n      telephone receiver.\n\n                             ADAM\n             General Fellgiebel, sir. He says\n             it's urgent.\n\n      Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend\n      and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private\n      call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg\n      simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.\n\n      A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the\n      receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway\n      he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.\n\n      Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still\n      hanging outside the briefing room.\n\n                        ADAM (CONT'D)\n             Colonel... Colonel, you forgot your-\n\n\n102   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                 102\n\n      Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map\n      before him as the General's presentation drags on.\n\n      Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by\n      Stauffenberg. His foot hits something. He looks at:\n\n      Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.\n\n      Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the\n      briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He\n      considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is\n      going to open it.\n\n      But then he puts it back under the table. But now the\n      heavy wooden support is BETWEEN Hitler and the bomb.\n\n                           GENERAL\n             ...And now I believe Colonel\n             Stauffenberg will present us with\n             his deployment for the Replacement\n             Army should the unthinkable occur\n             and the Russians reach-\n\n      Where is Stauffenberg? Keitel shoots Freyend a look.\n\n                                                          79.\n\n\n\n\n103   INT.

No sign of Stauffenberg.\n      Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused.\n\n                           FREYEND\n             Where the hell is Stauffenberg?\n\n      But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat.\n\n\n104   EXT.

Everyone hits the deck\n      except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.                       \n\n      A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The                \n      sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and\n      ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting.\n      Screaming. Absolute chaos.\n\n      Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned.\n      Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building\n      and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n             Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.\n             Tell him Hitler is dead.

A real\n\"what have I done\" moment.\n\n                       OLBRICHT\n       Dear God.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       Now where is Fromm? Is he with us\n       or did you-\n\n                     OLBRICHT\n       I- No one has spoken to him yet.\n\nStauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious -       \nfor the first and only time showing us a crack in his     \nultra-cool exterior. He collects himself and looks at     \nhis watch.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind\n       Germany. Never mind Europe. Your\n       life is at stake now, do you\n       understand? If you want to live\n       through the night you'll do exactly\n       as I say.\n\n                       OLBRICHT\n       I understand.\n\n                   STAUFFENBERG\n       The second you hang up the phone,\n       initiate Operation Valkyrie in\n       Fromm's name. Then go over to his\n       office in force, give him the\n       choice to join us or place him\n       under immediate arrest. Do I make\n       myself perfectly clear?\n\n                       OLBRICHT\n       I understand.\n\n                  STAUFFENBERG\n       I am at the airfield now. I will be\n       in Fromm's office in fifteen\n       minutes. Be there when I arrive.                   \n\nHe slams the phone down, taking us to:                    \n\n                                                       91.\n\n\n\n\n126   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             126\n\n      Silence. With shaking hands, Olbricht moves the\n      portrait of Hitler, exposing a hidden wall safe from\n      which he removes, at last, a thick folder marked:\n\n      VALKYRIE\n\n      He looks at Mertz.\n\n                           OLBRICHT\n             Get Beck and the others. Tell them                       \n             it's time.\n\n      Relieved, Mertz nods and rushes out. Olbricht picks\n      up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from\n      the first page of the Valkyrie order.\n\n                      OLBRICHT (CONT'D)\n             This is General Olbricht calling on\n             behalf of General Fromm - Commander\n             of the Home Army.

CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              127\n\n      Lt. Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his\n      shoulder. He turns to find Sgt. Helm, a sheet of\n      paper in his trembling hands.\n\n                             HELM\n             The F\u00fchrer is dead.\n\n      Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When\n      he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some\n      with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a\n      sense of relief.\n\n      A phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes\n      seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's\n      death starts to spread.\n\n                                                       92.\n\n\n\n      Long pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of\n      the moment.\n\n                            HAANS\n             You all know your jobs. Get to\n             work.\n\n      Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their\n      teletypes, passing orders along.\n\n      But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him\n      informed - notices something strange about one order            \n      in a stack of many he is sifting through.                       \n\n                           OPERATOR\n             Sergeant.

He`s not even in\n             the army anymore.\n\n      But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange.\n      Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering\n      how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi:\n\n                        HELM (CONT'D)\n             Pass the order along.\n\n\n128   EXT.

Stauffenberg can see the private fear in               \n      beck's eyes. But before he can answer, he is                    \n      interrupted by a gasp O.S. as Olbricht opens the door           \n      to his office, stepping back in shock.

WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             133\n\n      Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz,\n      Beck and Stauffenberg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\n      Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with\n      GERMAN OFFICERS - all of them standing in silence,\n      looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great\n      respect. Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts,\n      solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks.\n\n      A YOUNG OFFICER steps forward. He looks hauntingly\n      like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa.\n\n                        YOUNG OFFICER\n             Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're\n             reporting for duty.\n\n      Stauffenberg is moved beyond words. Suddenly, what\n      was once a small clutch of discarded generals and\n      politicians is now a movement of motivated men.\n      Stauffenberg nods, collects himself. In the crowd he\n      finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom\n      we met earlier. At first he speaks quietly, humbled.\n\n                        STAUFFENBERG\n                         (shaking hands)\n             Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you.\n             We're getting a late start and we\n             need all of the manpower we can\n             muster.

Is this true?                         \n\n      Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room               \n      share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg.           \n\n                         STAUFFENBERG\n             I can't offer you any guarantees.                        \n             The decision is yours and yours\n             alone.

PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in\n      the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what\n      Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally:\n\n                             HELLDORF\n             I'm with you.\n\n      Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a\n      palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers\n      in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.\n\n                         STAUFFENBERG\n             Have your men surround the\n             building.

WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT             149   \n\n      Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of\n      officers - the energy here being the antithesis of\n      Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning.\n\n      He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone\n      calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. But we know\n      now his orders are hitting a dead end.\n\n                       RADIO ANNOUNCER\n             ...The F\u00fchrer himself suffered no\n             major injuries and resumed his work\n             immediately...\n\n      Stauffenberg turns off the radio, grabbing Haeften\n      just as he is coming in.\n\n                         STAUFFENBERG\n             Send the following teleprint to all\n             Army Commanders... `Broadcast\n             communique not correct.

Stauffenberg turns back to\n      his work, coming face to face with a deeply troubled\n      Beck.

Neither the capital nor the\n       radio network are under our\n       control. And where are the troops?\n       You'd think there would be some\n       activity going on in this city.\n                  (to Stauffenberg)\n       The word is all over the street\n       that Hitler is still alive.

I                  \n       am the officer in charge. I am the                   \n       man responsible. No one else.                        \n\nOlbricht is moved and rightly so. Meanwhile:                \n\n                    WITZLEBEN\n       I'm going home to await my                           \n       inevitable arrest.                                   \n\nWitzleben turns, marching out. The room remains ill         \nat ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious\nblow to the Resistance.

He shares a\n      look with TWO OTHER OFFICERS. A wordless\n      understanding. He leaves and they follow.\n\n\n150   INT.

WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT             153\n\n      Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the\n      building below. It is only a matter of time now.\n\n      He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he\n      puts pen to paper and writes:\n\n      \"My dearest wife...\"\n\n      A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and\n      he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows.\n\n      The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO\n      COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED\n      SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht.                 \n\n      In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein\n      Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway.\n\n                                                         109.\n\n\n\n\n154   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT                154\n\n      Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls\n      and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the\n      coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven\n      bursts in. It is written on her face.\n\n\n155   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       155\n\n      Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's\n      office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS\n      surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines\n      when we see Herber talking to none other than Major\n      Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften.\n\n                              REMER\n             YOU THERE.\n\n      Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run.\n\n                          REMER (CONT'D)\n             HALT.\n\n      BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take\n      cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire.\n      Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his\n      right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers\n      of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires.                \n\n      Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his\n      good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly.                       \n\n      But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the\n      corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with              \n      his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him,             \n      shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their                 \n      guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S.                             \n\n      As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring                  \n      around his neck:                                                  \n\n                           HAEFTEN                                      \n             Thank you, Colonel.                                        \n\n      Stauffenberg is genuinely confused. \"For what?\"                   \n\n                       HAEFTEN (CONT'D)                                 \n             Better I die for Germany than for                          \n             Hitler.                                                    \n\n                                                         110.\n\n\n\n                         VOICE (O.S.)\n             Colonel Stauffenberg.\n\n      Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there.                  \n\n                            REMER\n             You're under arrest.                                       \n\n\n160   INT.

Then he\nturns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand:\n\n                    FROMM (CONT'D)\n        Continue.\n\nThe moment is surreal. Beck, seated at the desk,\nlooks at each of his fellow conspirators. A look of\nthanks, goodbye.

Herber, on the other\nhand, seems clearer than ever. He nods to his men who\ndrag the conspirators out. Herber personally takes\nStauffenberg by the arm. The two men share a look.\nNothing needs to be said. Each has found his place.\n\nStauffenberg turns to confront Fromm.
