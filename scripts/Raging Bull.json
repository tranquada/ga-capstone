And if\n\t      you're a guy like me, you ain't got\n\t      a chance in a place like that.\n\t      Especially if you're Italian... you\n\t      come from the Bronx... and you're\n\t      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw\n\t      me... soon as they heard me... I\n\t      know I'm in trouble. To me, they\n\t      got an accent, and to them, I got\n\t      an accent! You gotta get the\n\t      picture -- I'm big, I got small\n\t      hands, I walk like I'm still in the\n\t      ring... the balls of my feet pop up\n\t      and down, you know... and whenever\n\t      I get the chance, I read a lot.

Now I\n\t      didn't mind too much when they\n\t      called me \"Queer\" or \"Mr. Tough\n\t      Guy\" or \"Yankee Punk\"... But one\n\t      day these screws got to me...

They got a great sense of\n\t      humor when they're standin' there\n\t      with a gun in their arms and you\n\t      got a tree on your chest! So I look\n\t      up at him and say, \"Oh, this\n\t      tree... it fell on me.\" And he\n\t      says, \"Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have\n\t      known, I would've yelled 'timber'\"\n\t      I said, \"Hey, look... it hurts. I\n\t      think maybe I broke somethin'!\" He\n\t      says, \"Well, whaddaya know... Champ\n\t      PImp's got himself a boo-boo.\" Then\n\t      I got as stupid as him. I said, \"If\n\t      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'\n\t      me the money you made last night?\"!\n\t      Then another screw comes over and\n\t      says, \"This Yankee creep givin' you\n\t      trouble?\" -- What kind of trouble?\n\t      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with\n\t      the tree? Now anybody else in their\n\t      right mind would've said, \"No sir,\n\t      I wouldn't think of giving any of\n\t      you gentlemen trouble... I just\n\t      want to serve my time and get the\n\t      hell out of here as soon as I can.\"\n\t      That's anybody else.

Not noticing\n\tJAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near\n\tthe rear of the outdoor lot.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                JAKE\n</b>\t      Hey, Joey --\n<b>\t\n</b>\tJAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tJOEY looks at JAKE.

The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break\n\topen and splatter JOEY's pants legs.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tJOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he\n\tbelts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken\n\tby surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tJOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t      Go ahead.\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      Hit me again.\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      I deserve it...\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      Pay me back...\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      More...\n\t           (gets punched)\n<b>\t\n</b>\tJOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE.

BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe theater lights are flashing.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThis may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the\n\tMetropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the\n\tcorner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tA stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises \"An\n\tEvening with Jake LaMotta.\" The billboard also lists the\n\tauthors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod\n\tSerling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT.

He rehearses.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                JAKE\n</b>\t      You know, I'm not a philosopher or\n\t      anything like that but I been\n\t      around a little and the way I look\n\t      at it is -- We're, all of us,\n\t      lookin' for the same thing: a shot\n\t      at the title. No matter what you\n\t      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'\n\t      the best. Well, I had mine and\n\t      it'll always be in the record\n\t      books... it don't make no\n\t      difference what happens to me from\n\t      here on in -- I got my shot and\n\t      that's a fact. Some guys weren't\n\t      that lucky... like the one Marlon\n\t      Brando played in \"On the\n\t      Waterfront\" -- an up and comer\n\t      who's now a down and outer. You\n\t      remember... there was this scene in\n\t      the back of the car with his\n\t      brother Charlie, a small-time\n\t      racket guy, and it went somethin'\n\t      like this -- \"It wasn't him,\n\t      Charlie. It was you. You 'member\n\t      that night in the Garden you came\n\t      down my dressing room and said.\n\t      'Kid, this ain't your night.\n\t      We're going for the price on\n\t      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This\n\t      ain't your night!' My night -- I\n\t      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what\n\t      happens? He gets the title shot\n\t      outdoors on the ballpark, and what\n\t      do I get? A one-way ticket to\n\t      Palookaville. I never was no good\n\t      after that night. It was like a\n\t      peak you reach. Then it went\n\t      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You\n\t      was my brother, Charlie. You\n\t      shoulda looked out for me a little\n\t      bit. You shoulda taken care of me\n\t      just a little bit so I wouldn't\n\t      have to take them dives for the\n\t      short end money... You don't\n\t      understand! I coulda had class. I\n\t      coulda been a contender. I coulda\n\t      been somebody -- instead of a bum,\n\t      which is what I am.
