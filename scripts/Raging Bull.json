At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the\n\tballs of his feet still pop up and down like they were on\n\tcanvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short\n\tbursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.\n\t     It's a thrill to be standing here\n\t     talking to you wonderful people. In\n\t     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!\n\t     I haven't seen so many people since\n\t     my last fight at Madison Square\n\t     Garden. After that fight, a\n\t     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do\n\t     you go from here?' I said, 'To a\n\t     hospital!' I fought one hundred and\n\t     six professional fights and still\n\t     none of them bums figured out how\n\t     to fight me -- they kept hitting me\n\t     in the head!

CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)\n\t\n\tBam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,\n\t19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter\n\thow hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always\n\tstaggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.\n\t\n\tBattered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.\n\t\n\tIt's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.\n\tYoung SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --\n\teach screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.\n\t\n\tSuddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER\n\tand a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.\n\t\n\tAND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits\n\tblood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for\n\thim. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     You didn't have to come to\n\t     Cleveland to get beat by a \"moulan\n\t     yan,\" Jake!\n\t\n\t               TONY\n\t     He's got you, Jake! You're\n\t     outpointed! You're coming up for\n\t     the tenth. You gotta knock him out!\n\t\n\tThe bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and\n\tcharges at REEVES.\n\t\n\tREEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.\n\t\n\tIn JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     A grand apiece! We got a grand\n\t     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking\n\t     grand!\n\t\n\tJAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild\n\talley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.\n\t\n\tThe SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.\n\t\n\tREEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.\n\t\n\tThe REFEREE counts:\n\t\n\t               REFEREE\n\t     One, two, three, four...\n\t\n\tThe GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the\n\tunderdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and\n\tsteps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending\n\tnot to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a\n\tfew seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but\n\tnot enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the\n\tcount of nine, ending the match.\n\t\n\tBoos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to\n\tget their money.\n\t\n\tJAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting\n\tthem toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.\n\t\n\tThe ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:\n\t\n\t               ANNOUNCER\n\t     Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,\n\t     under the rules of the Cleveland\n\t     Boxing Commission, after ten\n\t     rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy\n\t     Reeves.\n\t\n\tThe ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to\n\tlift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS\n\tbring in a stretcher.\n\t\n\tJAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to\n\tfigure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and\n\tthe FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting\n\twith the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.\n\tPEOPLE go into the ring.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t          (to Jake)\n\t     Don't get out of the ring. You won\n\t     the fight -- let him go out first.\n\t\n\t                                   CUT TO:\n\t\n\tREEVES being placed on the stretcher.\n\t\n\tA ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to\n\tplay the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" REEVES is carried out.\n\t\n\tOnly then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.\n\t\n\tEXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY\n\t\n\tIt's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare\n\tcases and street kids.\n\t\n\tIn the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange\n\twords and start to fight.

It's important to wait for\n\t     Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't\n\t     important to wait for no steak! I\n\t     won that fight. So, I stayed in the\n\t     ring, and that way I made sure\n\t     everybody knew it. I shoulda\n\t     knocked him out earlier,\n\t     sonofabitch.\n\t\n\tHe starts to eat the steak.

JAKE takes a lot of\n\tpunishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE\n\tnails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and\n\tpounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right\n\tcross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a\n\tleft to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the\n\tropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.\n\tSUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,\n\twhile the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.\n\t\n\tTIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.\n\tJAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.\n\t\n\tINT. GLEASON'S - DAY (1943)\n\t\n\tJAKE's press conference.\n\t\n\tFIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to\n\tfinish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.\n\tJAKE is not thrilled with having them there.\n\t\n\tThe gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone\n\texception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and\n\tquite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives\n\tmiserable, despite their head and belly protectors.\n\t\n\tJOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the\n\tREPORTERS:\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     The fuckin' papers are full of\n\t     Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and\n\t     Jake knocked him clear outa the\n\t     ring in Detroit. He's the only guy\n\t     ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa\n\t     matter with you? I thought we had\n\t     an arrangement.\n\t\n\t               REPORTER\n\t     We do Joey. You know we do.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     You holding me up for more cash or\n\t     what?\n\t\n\tThe bell sounds, ending the sparring round.\n\t\n\t               REPORTER\n\t     I can't print nothing if Jake won't\n\t     give me nothing.\n\t\n\tJOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far\n\tbehind.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look\n\t     stupid. I brought these guys up\n\t     here, now you don't wanna talk to\n\t     them? What are ya doin'? Open your\n\t     mouth, for Christsake.\n\t\n\tJAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly\n\tover to the REPORTER, who is about to say: \"Hi, Jake.\"\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t          (interrupting)\n\t     I'm tallin' you now, when I read\n\t     this, it better not make me look\n\t     bad.\n\t\n\t               REPORTER\n\t     Jake, did I ever make you look bad\n\t     before?\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Maybe it wasn't you, but you know\n\t     what I'm talkin' about.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t          (interrupting)\n\t     Don't worry.

There's nobody else around\n\t     who wants to fight me; they're all\n\t     afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't\n\t     have a shot at the title right now.\n\t\n\t               REPORTER\n\t     Well, the word is to get a title\n\t     shot you have to cooperate with the\n\t     people who control boxing, in New\n\t     York. And they're saying that you\n\t     don't cooperate.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     You guys know more about that than\n\t     I do.

ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)\n\t\n\tJAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the\n\tbed examining his muscle tone.\n\t\n\tHe studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his\n\twrists. Clenches. Unclenches.\n\t\n\tVICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and\n\tpanties.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     Are you sure we should be doing\n\t     this?\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Come over here.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     You said never to touch you before\n\t     a fight.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t          (lovingly)\n\t     If you let me do it, I'll murder\n\t     you.

He respects her as he would\n\ta shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.\n\t\n\tHis round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised\n\tknuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.\n\t\n\tShe kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised\n\tface.\n\t\n\t               JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t     Take off my pants.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     Jake...\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Do what I say.\n\t\n\tHe touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.\n\t\n\t               JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t     Now take the rest off.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     Jake, you made me promise not to\n\t     get you excited.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Go 'head. Do it.\n\t\n\tShe pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She\n\tkisses his chest and licks it.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     I like the gym smell.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     Now take your panties off.\n\t\n\tShe does.\n\t\n\t               JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t     Now, touch me...\n\t          (takes her hand)\n\t     ... here.\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     Oh, Jake.\n\t\n\tShe caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his\n\terection.\n\t\n\tJAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on\n\tVICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold\n\twater.\n\t\n\tVICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold\n\twater. She is shocked and surprised.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     I can't do it. I can't fool around.\n\t     This Robinson, I gotta beat him\n\t     again. I can't fool around. Don't\n\t     come near me.\n\t\n\tJAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,\n\the turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,\n\tand he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes\n\tthe door.\n\t\n\tINT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)\n\t\n\tThis is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN\n\tANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.\n\t\n\tTHE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY\n\tknocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and\n\tlefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays\n\tin there.\n\t\n\tTHE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY\n\tinto his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.\n\tSUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,\n\tthe blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;\n\tinstead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.\n\t\n\tTIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is\n\tthe winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for\n\tso long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the\n\tfighters in the next bout.\n\t\n\tINT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the\n\ttable, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO\n\tHANGERS-ON are also present.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t          (angry)\n\t     They robbed us! Those fuckin'\n\t     judges -- What the fuck fight were\n\t     they watching? If I see them on the\n\t     street, I'll break their heads.\n\t     Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!\n\t     Those judges give him the decision\n\t     'cause he's goin in the army next\n\t     week! How else could this have\n\t     happened?... What do you think they\n\t     gave him the decision for, that's\n\t     why.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t          (almost to himself)\n\t     Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked\n\t     him down. What did I do wrong? I\n\t     don't understand.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     You won and was robbed! You didn't\n\t     do nothin' wrong.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     I dunno.

This\n\t     coulda done it. This was our shot.\n\t     They out and out robbed us.\n\t\n\tMARIO comes back from the door.\n\t\n\t               MARIO\n\t     Vickie is here, Jake.\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     I don't wanna see nobody.\n\t\n\t               JOEY\n\t     You want us to wait for you?\n\t\n\t               JAKE\n\t     No, take her home.

BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM\n\t\n\tJAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the\n\tbathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly\n\tacquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.\n\t\n\tWe hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This\n\tsong carries over onto the following MONTAGE.\n\t\n\tMONTAGE\n\t\n\tThis MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.\n\tIt shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he\n\tcan. Each of the fights will be introduced by the\n\tcorresponding title card from the \"Big Fights\" film showing a\n\tboxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the\n\tfights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be\n\tblack and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to\n\tsimulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about\n\tto land a punch on an OPPONENT.\n\t\n\t                                   CUT TO:\n\t\n\tStill #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's\n\tface, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects\n\taccompany these stills.\n\t\n\tThe fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home\n\tmovies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black\n\tand white).\n\t\n\tIt'll go something like this:\n\t\n\tA) JAKE VS.

On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the\n\tpreceding montage.\n\t\n\tJAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE\n\tJAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.\n\t\n\tJOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is\n\tnear the television. There are some remnants of a snack on\n\tthe table.

You been killin' yourself for\n\t     three years. There's nobody left --\n\t     they're afraid to fight you.\n\t     This Janiro's up-and-coming. He\n\t     don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,\n\t     wipe him out! What are you worried\n\t     about? Your weight? Look, even if\n\t     you lose they're gonna think you're\n\t     weak; they're gonna think you're\n\t     not the fighter you used to be.\n\t     They'll match you with guys they\n\t     were afraid to match you with\n\t     before, and then you'll kill them\n\t     and you'll get your title shot. And\n\t     if you beat this kid Janiro, they\n\t     gotta give you a shot at the title\n\t     because there's nobody else. Either\n\t     way you win and you do it on your\n\t     own -- just like you want it. All\n\t     right?\n\t\n\t               VICKIE\n\t     Joey's right.

FOX goes to the\n\thead; JAKE goes to the body.\n\t\n\tFOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.\n\tFOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down\n\twhen he connected.\n\t\n\tIn the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with\n\tinterest.\n\t\n\tJAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.\n\tAll of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then\n\tcuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.\n\t\n\tJAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t           (to Fox)\n\t      Stand up!

In\n\t      fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.\n\t      I haven't seen so many people since\n\t      my last fight at Madison Square\n\t      Garden. After that fight a reporter\n\t      asked me, \"Jake, where do you go\n\t      from here?\" I said, \"To a\n\t      hospital.\"\n\t\n\tAbout HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are\n\tlaughing, SOME a little too loud.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      I fought one hundred and six\n\t      professional fights and none of\n\t      them bums figured out how to fight\n\t      me -- they kept hitting me in the\n\t      head!\n\t           (calls to the bar)\n\t      Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? \n\t      - get me a drink. I figure if I'm\n\t      gonna work to drunks I might as\n\t      well be one of 'em! I like this\n\t      place. It's a family type club...\n\t      every night I see a lot of fathers\n\t      sitting out there with their young\n\t      daughters!

As\n\t      long as I don't swallow it! Well, I\n\t      never had much luck with my weight.\n\t      In fact, -- I never had much luck\n\t      with anything -- until about a few\n\t      years ago, when this happened --\n\t\n\tHe indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,\n\tof which there is some.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      ... thanks, I'm glad to see you\n\t      remember. For those of you that\n\t      don't... that's me takin' the title\n\t      from Cerdan.\n\t      You know, the tough thing about\n\t      winnin' the title... the next thing\n\t      you gotta do is have a rematch...\n\t      just to show it wasn't no fluke. So\n\t      what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a\n\t      really great champ, after I beat\n\t      him... he gets himself killed in\n\t      that airplane crash... a pretty\n\t      rotten break for him. That's why I\n\t      don't like to fly. People say to\n\t      me, \"Look, Jake, when your time is\n\t      up, your time is up.\" And I say,\n\t      \"Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane\n\t      and the pilot's time is up?\" As\n\t      good as Cerdan was, I could've\n\t      taken him again. But I never got\n\t      the chance to prove it wasn't no\n\t      fluke. He got killed but he got to\n\t      be what they call a legend. I don't\n\t      know what's worse -- bein' a fluke\n\t      or bein' a legend. -- That's the\n\t      kinda luck I got. That's why I quit\n\t      the ring and moved down here from\n\t      New York. My wife said, \"You gotta\n\t      get outa this town, Jake.\" Come to\n\t      think of it... the boxing\n\t      commission said the same thing! But\n\t      I don't miss New York.

I\n\t      can't help that.\n\t      She says, \"Whataya hittin' me for?\"\n\t      I says, \"It's nothin'. It's only a\n\t      love tap.\" She says, \"It's a good\n\t      thing you're not crazy about me!\" --\n\t      I am crazy about her. I heard her\n\t      talkin' to a friend on the phone\n\t      and she was sayin', \"After eleven\n\t      years, I'm still in love with the\n\t      same guy.\" -- If I ever find out\n\t      who the bum is, I'll kill him!\n\t      Women. You can't live with 'em, you\n\t      can't live without 'em.\n\t\n\tThen, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's\n\tspeech in Othello.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      \"'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.\n\t      It is the green-eyed monster, which\n\t      doth mock the meat it feeds on.\n\t      That cuckold lives in bliss who,\n\t      certain of his fate, loves not his\n\t      woronger; But O, what damned\n\t      minutes tells he o'er who dotes,\n\t      yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly\n\t      loves!\" -- That's from somethin'\n\t      called \"Othello\" --\n\t\n\tOR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      Is whispering nothing?

You\n\t      all remember Shakespeare.\n\t      He wrote all them famous plays one\n\t      after the other, then he went into\n\t      a big slump and he ain't done\n\t      anything good in years. That speech\n\t      is about jealousy -- jealousy's a\n\t      bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot\n\t      of guys... take me... I almost\n\t      killed my brother... I love him...\n\t      he's my family... I mean, there's\n\t      nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And\n\t      that's the way we been goin' thru\n\t      life -- doin' nothin' for each\n\t      other!

He is singing at\n\tthe PATRONS rather than to them.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      \"When the fighter's not engaged in\n\t      his employment, his employment,\n\t      although he was Champ and quite the\n\t      rage, he must go somewhere else to\n\t      seek employment, seek employment.\n\t      So what does he do? He goes upon\n\t      the stage and meets his true\n\t      adversaries, all you members of the\n\t      human race. But a fighter's life is\n\t      not a bowl of cherries, still I'd\n\t      rather have an egg than a fist upon\n\t      my face... That's Entertainment!\n\t\n\tJAKE brings the BAND to a crescendo with a wave of his hand,\n\tthen silences it. The spotlight goes out and there is a\n\thearty round of applause.\n\t\n\tJAKE receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations\n\tof the PATRONS as he works his way around the club.\n\t\n\tJAKE's new friends love him. They are PARTY GIRLS, SPORTS\n\tFIGURES, COLUMNISTS, MOBSTERS, B ACTORS, and OTHER\n\t\"CELEBRITIES.\"\n\t\n\tJAKE poses for a still with TWO BUXOM YOUNG LOVELIES. ONE\n\tGIRL giggles as he fondles her.

Oh Jake, this is\n\t      State's Attorney Bronson and his\n\t      wife.\n\t\n\tJAKE shakes his hand, then holds it up -- showing an empty\n\tpalm.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t           (joking)\n\t      Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I\n\t      didn't mean that. If I don't give\n\t      your husband no money, he won't\n\t      have enough to buy you a drink. To\n\t      show you I'm a nice guy, this one's\n\t      on me. The last one was your\n\t      payment for this month.\n\t\n\tBRONSON is embarrassed. He doesn't think the joke is funny,\n\tbut he manages a smile. His WIFE gives a nervous laugh.

R.\n\t      You ought to see his wife.\n\t\n\tJAKE steps over to a table where some of the \"BOYS\" are\n\tsitting. RICKY is the Miami 1956 version of Salvy.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      Hey, Ricky, glad you came.\n\t\n\t                RICKY\n\t      Wouldn't miss it, Jake.\n\t\n\tJAKE calls a WAITRESS over.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      Hey, honey, give these fellas a\n\t      round on me.

I made up my mind.\n\t\n\tJAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power\n\tswitch, closing it and catching his hand.

JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY\n\t\n\tJAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE\n\twatches from a safe distance.\n\t\n\tJAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the\n\tglass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.\n\t\n\tIn the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a\n\tdrawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts\n\tdigging the jewels out of it.\n\t\n\tVICKIE appears in the doorway.\n\t\n\t                VICKIE\n\t      What are you doing?\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      I need ten thousand dollars.

Did you ever see a\n\t      14-year-old testify in court? Did\n\t      you see the papers? \"LaMotta on\n\t      Vice Rap.\" Everybody likes a shot\n\t      at the Champ.\n\t\n\t                VICKIE\n\t      Jake, be careful! What're you doing\n\t      to the belt?!\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      Don't make no difference no more.\n\t\n\t                VICKIE\n\t      Can't you get the money from your\n\t      friends?\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      What friends?\n\t\n\tJAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers\n\tat it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.\n\tJAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.\n\t\n\tINT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY\n\t\n\tJAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The\n\tJEWELER examines the stones.\n\t\n\t                JEWELER\n\t      Didn't you also wish to sell the\n\t      Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      That's it.

These stones are worth about\n\t      fifteen hudred dollars, but the\n\t      belt of a champion is a very rare\n\t      item. The belt with the stones\n\t      untouched would have been worth\n\t      near five thousand dollars.\n\t\n\tJAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the\n\tattempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.\n\t\n\tEXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY\n\t\n\tJAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t           (on phone)\n\t      I can't raise the ten thousand.\n\t      Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.\n\t\n\tINT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSame as Scene 1.\n\t\n\tJAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated\n\tacross from a mirror.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      So there I am in the can... and not\n\t      the one that says \"gentlemen\" on\n\t      the door. I'm talkin' about jail!\n\t      Down south!\n\t      I mean, jail up north is gotta be\n\t      like summer camp compared to jail\n\t      down in cracker country. And if\n\t      you're a guy like me, you ain't got\n\t      a chance in a place like that.\n\t      Especially if you're Italian... you\n\t      come from the Bronx... and you're\n\t      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw\n\t      me... soon as they heard me... I\n\t      know I'm in trouble. To me, they\n\t      got an accent, and to them, I got\n\t      an accent! You gotta get the\n\t      picture -- I'm big, I got small\n\t      hands, I walk like I'm still in the\n\t      ring... the balls of my feet pop up\n\t      and down, you know... and whenever\n\t      I get the chance, I read a lot. So\n\t      naturally, takin' all this into\n\t                                      co\n\t      sideration, they figure it adds up\n\t      to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I\n\t      didn't mind too much when they\n\t      called me \"Queer\" or \"Mr. Tough\n\t      Guy\" or \"Yankee Punk\"... But one\n\t      day these screws got to me... I was\n\t      workin' on the work gang, pickin'\n\t      up some trees that were knocked\n\t      down by a storm or somethin' and\n\t      puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a\n\t      sudden... one of the trees slipped\n\t      and fell on me and pinned me to the\n\t      ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree\n\t      across my chest! This screw walks\n\t      over, takin' his time, he looks\n\t      down at me and says, \"Well, Champ\n\t      Pimp... you lyin' down on the job\n\t      again?\"! They got a great sense of\n\t      humor when they're standin' there\n\t      with a gun in their arms and you\n\t      got a tree on your chest! So I look\n\t      up at him and say, \"Oh, this\n\t      tree... it fell on me.\" And he\n\t      says, \"Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have\n\t      known, I would've yelled 'timber'\"\n\t      I said, \"Hey, look... it hurts. I\n\t      think maybe I broke somethin'!\" He\n\t      says, \"Well, whaddaya know... Champ\n\t      PImp's got himself a boo-boo.\" Then\n\t      I got as stupid as him. I said, \"If\n\t      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'\n\t      me the money you made last night?\"!\n\t      Then another screw comes over and\n\t      says, \"This Yankee creep givin' you\n\t      trouble?\" -- What kind of trouble?\n\t      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with\n\t      the tree? Now anybody else in their\n\t      right mind would've said, \"No sir,\n\t      I wouldn't think of giving any of\n\t      you gentlemen trouble... I just\n\t      want to serve my time and get the\n\t      hell out of here as soon as I can.\"\n\t      That's anybody else. When I said\n\t      it... it was a little different.\n\t      \"You stupid cracker... take your\n\t      hands off me or I'll get up and\n\t      kick your brains out -- but first\n\t      you gotta bend over so I can find\n\t      'em!\" Next thing I know I'm in the\n\t      hole. Solitary confinement. All my\n\t      life I had guys in my corner\n\t      yellin' \"Go get 'em, jake... kill\n\t      'em! You're the greatest.\" Now\n\t      there's nobody rootin' for me. But\n\t      it wasn't so bad. I learned things\n\t      there. I learned how to scratch a\n\t      calendar on the wall. I never knew\n\t      how to do that before. Now I know.\n\t      Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is\n\t      two scratches. Wednesday is three\n\t      scratches. And so on. Except for\n\t      Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.\n\t      Sundays rested.\n\t\n\tINT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY\n\t\n\tThe CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade\n\tCounty Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.\n\t\n\tJAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and\n\tlegs are manacled and chained.\n\t\n\tThe GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in\n\tworking JAKE over.\n\t\n\tThey take JAKE to the \"Hole\" -- solitary confinement.\n\t\n\tONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.\n\t\n\tBoth GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.\n\t\n\tINT.

METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)\n\t\n\tThe Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.\n\t\n\tJAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,\n\tcontinues his monologue.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      Except here, gentlemen, with you\n\t      bums. I call you \"gentlemen\"... but\n\t      you know what you really are! You\n\t      know, this place used to be pretty\n\t      exclusive... now they got bouncers\n\t      outside to throw the drunks in! My\n\t      first night here I said to the\n\t      boss, \"Where's the toilet?\" -- He\n\t      said, \"You're in it!\" By the way,\n\t      this engagement is just a stepping\n\t      stone for me. If I do good here,\n\t      I'm ready to get out of the\n\t      business!\n\t\n\tThe CROWD starts to shout: \"Get the fuck off the stage!\"\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'\n\t      for -- and from the looks of you,\n\t      you been waitin' for it for a long\n\t      time. I had my own joint in Miami\n\t      Beach once... it was too high-class\n\t      for you guys... we had a 50-cent\n\t      minimum charge just to keep out the\n\t      riff-raff!\n\t\n\tThe CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:\n\t\"Bring out the girls!\"\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.\n\t           (grabs his crotch)\n\t      Yeah, she's here... just like it's\n\t      advertised out front. She's come\n\t      back. A girl who's seen the Lower\n\t      Depths... who's been as far as I\n\t      have in that direction. She's on\n\t      her way back up now... give you an\n\t      idea how low she was! Let's give\n\t      her a warm welcome... make her glad\n\t      she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma\n\t      48's!\n\t\n\tJAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her\n\tdance.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIt's about twenty minutes later.\n\t\n\tDOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.\n\tHe looks at the delicatessen.\n\t\n\tJOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing\n\tJAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near\n\tthe rear of the outdoor lot.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      Hey, Joey --\n\t\n\tJAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.\n\t\n\tJOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts\n\tto get into his car.\n\t\n\tJAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,\n\t      please --\n\t\n\tJOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his\n\tshoulder, and starts to get into his car again.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      Aw, Joey --\n\t\n\tJAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand\n\ton JOEY's shoulder again.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      You're right. You're perfectly\n\t      right. You got every right in the\n\t      world to hate my guts.\n\t\n\tJOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper\n\tbag into the front seat of the car.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      No, please. I know I was a\n\t      cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda\n\t      never raised my hands to you.\n\t\n\tJOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car\n\tagain.\n\t\n\tJAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      No, Joey, listen to me --\n\t\n\tJAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to\n\this feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break\n\topen and splatter JOEY's pants legs.\n\t\n\tJOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he\n\tbelts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken\n\tby surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.\n\t\n\tJOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      Go ahead.\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      Hit me again.\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      I deserve it...\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      Pay me back...\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t      More...\n\t           (gets punched)\n\t\n\tJOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure\n\tit out.\n\t\n\tJAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.\n\t\n\t                JAKE (CONT'D)\n\t      More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.\n\t\n\tJOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's\n\tshoulder.\n\tHe leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and\n\tfinally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to\n\tfill his eyes.\n\t\n\tJOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.\n\t\n\tThey hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.\n\t\n\tEXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)\n\t\n\tThe theater lights are flashing.\n\t\n\tThis may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the\n\tMetropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the\n\tcorner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.\n\t\n\tA stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises \"An\n\tEvening with Jake LaMotta.\" The billboard also lists the\n\tauthors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod\n\tSerling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.\n\t\n\tINT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSame as Scenes One and Eighty-One.\n\t\n\tJAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.\n\t\n\t                JAKE\n\t      You know, I'm not a philosopher or\n\t      anything like that but I been\n\t      around a little and the way I look\n\t      at it is -- We're, all of us,\n\t      lookin' for the same thing: a shot\n\t      at the title. No matter what you\n\t      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'\n\t      the best. Well, I had mine and\n\t      it'll always be in the record\n\t      books... it don't make no\n\t      difference what happens to me from\n\t      here on in -- I got my shot and\n\t      that's a fact. Some guys weren't\n\t      that lucky... like the one Marlon\n\t      Brando played in \"On the\n\t      Waterfront\" -- an up and comer\n\t      who's now a down and outer. You\n\t      remember... there was this scene in\n\t      the back of the car with his\n\t      brother Charlie, a small-time\n\t      racket guy, and it went somethin'\n\t      like this -- \"It wasn't him,\n\t      Charlie. It was you. You 'member\n\t      that night in the Garden you came\n\t      down my dressing room and said.\n\t      'Kid, this ain't your night.\n\t      We're going for the price on\n\t      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This\n\t      ain't your night!' My night -- I\n\t      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what\n\t      happens? He gets the title shot\n\t      outdoors on the ballpark, and what\n\t      do I get? A one-way ticket to\n\t      Palookaville. I never was no good\n\t      after that night. It was like a\n\t      peak you reach. Then it went\n\t      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You\n\t      was my brother, Charlie. You\n\t      shoulda looked out for me a little\n\t      bit. You shoulda taken care of me\n\t      just a little bit so I wouldn't\n\t      have to take them dives for the\n\t      short end money... You don't\n\t      understand! I coulda had class. I\n\t      coulda been a contender. I coulda\n\t      been somebody -- instead of a bum,\n\t      which is what I am.
